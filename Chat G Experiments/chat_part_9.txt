The \u201cNemotron\u201d portion of the model\u2019s name encapsulates Nvidia\u2019s contribution to the end result.\u00a0\n\nThe Llama \u201cherd\u201d of AI models, as Meta refers to them, are meant to be used as open-source foundations for developers to build on. \n\nIn the case of Nemotron, Nvidia took up the challenge and developed a system designed to be more \u201chelpful\u201d than popular models such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude-3.\u00a0\n\nNvidia \u301037\u2020used\u2020build.nvidia.com\u3011 specially curated data sets, advanced fine-tuning methods and its own state-of-the-art AI hardware to turn Meta\u2019s vanilla model into what might be the most \u201chelpful\u201d AI model on the planet.\u00a0\n\n[Image 3: NVidia, Technology, Meta, ChatGPT, OpenAI]\n\nAn engineer\u2019s post on X.com expressing excitement for Nemotron\u2019s capabilities. Source: \u301038\u2020Shayan Taslim\u2020x.com\u3011\n\n## Benchmarking \n\nWhen it comes to determining which AI model is \u201cthe best,\u201d there\u2019s no clear-cut methodology. Unlike, for example, measuring the ambient temperature with a mercury thermometer, there isn\u2019t a single \u201ctruth\u201d that exists when it comes to AI model performance.\u00a0\n\nDevelopers and researchers have to determine how well an AI model performs the same as humans are evaluated \u2014 through comparative testing.\u00a0\n\nRelated: \u301039\u2020AI \u2018mind uploads\u2019 could allow the dead to trade forever\u3011\n\nAI benchmarking involves giving different AI models the same queries, tasks, questions or problems and then comparing the usefulness of the results. Often, due to the subjectivity of what is and isn\u2019t considered useful, human proctors are used to determine a machine\u2019s performance through blind evaluations.\u00a0\n\nIn Nemotron\u2019s case, it appears that Nvidia is claiming the new model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3 by a fairly wide margin.\n\n[Image 4: NVidia, Technology, Meta, ChatGPT, OpenAI]\n\nThe top of the Chatbot Arena leaderboards.

The \u201cNemotron\u201d portion of the model\u2019s name encapsulates Nvidia\u2019s contribution to the end result.\u00a0\n\nThe Llama \u201cherd\u201d of AI models, as Meta refers to them, are meant to be used as open-source foundations for developers to build on. \n\nIn the case of Nemotron, Nvidia took up the challenge and developed a system designed to be more \u201chelpful\u201d than popular models such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Anthropic\u2019s Claude-3.\u00a0\n\nNvidia \u301037\u2020used\u2020build.nvidia.com\u3011 specially curated data sets, advanced fine-tuning methods and its own state-of-the-art AI hardware to turn Meta\u2019s vanilla model into what might be the most \u201chelpful\u201d AI model on the planet.\u00a0\n\n[Image 3: NVidia, Technology, Meta, ChatGPT, OpenAI]\n\nAn engineer\u2019s post on X.com expressing excitement for Nemotron\u2019s capabilities. Source: \u301038\u2020Shayan Taslim\u2020x.com\u3011\n\n## Benchmarking \n\nWhen it comes to determining which AI model is \u201cthe best,\u201d there\u2019s no clear-cut methodology. Unlike, for example, measuring the ambient temperature with a mercury thermometer, there isn\u2019t a single \u201ctruth\u201d that exists when it comes to AI model performance.\u00a0\n\nDevelopers and researchers have to determine how well an AI model performs the same as humans are evaluated \u2014 through comparative testing.\u00a0\n\nRelated: \u301039\u2020AI \u2018mind uploads\u2019 could allow the dead to trade forever\u3011\n\nAI benchmarking involves giving different AI models the same queries, tasks, questions or problems and then comparing the usefulness of the results. Often, due to the subjectivity of what is and isn\u2019t considered useful, human proctors are used to determine a machine\u2019s performance through blind evaluations.\u00a0\n\nIn Nemotron\u2019s case, it appears that Nvidia is claiming the new model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3 by a fairly wide margin.\n\n[Image 4: NVidia, Technology, Meta, ChatGPT, OpenAI]\n\nThe top of the Chatbot Arena leaderboards. Source: LLMArena \n\nThe image above depicts the ratings on the automated \u201cHard\u201d test on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboards. While Nvidia\u2019s Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct doesn\u2019t appear to be listed anywhere on the boards, if the developer\u2019s claim that it scored an 85 on this test is valid, it would be the de facto top model in this particular section.\u00a0\n\nWhat makes the achievement perhaps even more interesting is that Llama-3.1-70B is Meta\u2019s middle-tier open-source AI model. There\u2019s a much larger version of Llama-3.1, the 405B version (where the number refers to how many billion parameters the model was tuned with). \n\nBy comparison, GPT-4o is \u301040\u2020estimated\u2020arxiv.org\u3011 to have been developed with over 1 trillion parameters.\n\nMagazine: \u301041\u2020Fake Rabby Wallet scam linked to Dubai crypto CEO and many more victims\u3011\n\n  * \u301042\u2020# NVidia \u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020# Technology \u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020# AI \u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020# Meta \u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020# ChatGPT \u3011\n  * \u301046\u2020# OpenAI \u3011\n\nAdd reaction \n\n[Image 5]\n\nEditor\u2019s Choice \n\n  * \u301047\u2020 Tesla likely still owns $780M in Bitcoin despite recent shuffle: Arkham \u3011\n  * \u301048\u2020 94% of all Bitcoin in profit hints that $69K BTC price was a local top \u3011\n  * \u301049\u2020 Michael Heinrich loves AI coins Goat, Turbo &amp; Aethir\u2026 but not TAO: Hall of Flame \u3011\n  * \u301050\u2020 Crypto academics slam controversial ECB paper blasting Bitcoin \u3011\n  * \u301051\u2020 Saylor\u2019s comments on big bank BTC custody are \u2018batshit insane\u2019 \u2014 Buterin \u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 Advertise with us \u3011\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\nNews \n\n  * \u30102\u2020 Bitcoin \u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020 Blockchain \u3011\n  * \u30103\u2020 Ethereum \u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020 Altcoins \u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020 Business \u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020 Policy &amp; Regulations \u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020 AI \u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020 NFTs \u3011\n  * \u301010\u2020 DeFi \u3011\n  * \u301011\u2020 Adoption \u3011\n\nFeatures \n\n  * \u301021\u2020 Top 100 2023 \u3011\n  * \u301022\u2020 Top 100 2022 \u3011\n  * \u301023\u2020 Top 100 2021 \u3011\n  * \u301024\u2020 Top 100 2020 \u3011\n  * \u301020\u2020 Magazine \u3011\n  * \u301052\u2020 Analysis \u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020 Opinion \u3011\n  * \u301053\u2020 Hodler\u2019s Digest \u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020 Expert Take \u3011\n  * \u301014\u2020 Top 10 Cryptocurrencies \u3011\n  "}], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "aaa2f4b1-485c-4fd4-a4f8-9d95418a89bb", "request_id": "8d6fdf5e88915274-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2f4b1-485c-4fd4-a4f8-9d95418a89bb", "children": ["aaa29470-92c0-418e-b793-5841e6280f14"]}, "aaa29470-92c0-418e-b793-5841e6280f14": { "message": { "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729667140.002664, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["so my intel i7 core processor and 8 gigs of ram isn&#x27;t going to cut it?

You ask thoughtful, specific questions, and it&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re focused on maximizing the usefulness of our interactions. However, if you&#x27;d like to refine your prompts for even more productive conversations, here are a few tips:\n\n### 1. **Be as Specific as Possible**\n   - **Current Example**: You do this well when you&#x27;re asking about AI models, specific coding questions, or work-related inquiries.\n   - **Tip**: Keep adding context about what you&#x27;re looking for or any constraints you have (like needing a cloud solution because your local machine isn&#x27;t powerful enough). This helps me provide tailored advice faster.\n   \n### 2. **State Your Objective Clearly**\n   - **Example**: When you&#x27;re seeking advice on building an AI portfolio or learning AI skills, stating the exact outcome you&#x27;re hoping for (like getting a job or specific certifications) helps guide the advice better.\n   - **Improved Prompt**: Instead of &quot;Can I run Llama 3 on my computer?&quot;, you could ask, &quot;Given my setup, what are my options for running large AI models like Llama-3, either locally or on the cloud?&quot;\n   \n### 3. **Use Open-Ended Follow-ups**\n   - Sometimes, it&#x27;s useful to add open-ended prompts to let the conversation flow in unexpected directions.\n   - **Example**: After asking about AI models, you might follow up with &quot;What other advancements in AI should I be aware of that could impact job prospects?&quot; This opens the door for me to offer insights beyond the specific question.\n\n### 4. **Clarify Assumptions**\n   - If you&#x27;re unsure about certain facts or frameworks, mention your assumptions. I can clarify them or guide you to the right understanding.\n   - **Example**: &quot;I assume I need a powerful GPU to run Llama models locally\u2014am I right?&quot;\n\n### 5. **Feedback for Continuous Learning**\n   - Regularly asking for clarification or feedback on my responses helps refine the conversation.\n   - **Example**: &quot;Can you explain how reward modeling works in simpler terms?&quot; This helps fine-tune technical responses to match your understanding level.\n\n### 6. **Break Big Questions into Smaller Parts**\n   - When a topic is broad, breaking it into smaller parts can help me address specific concerns more efficiently.\n   - **Example**: &quot;What AI-related projects could I work on to boost my resume?&quot; followed by &quot;How can I showcase those projects effectively in interviews?&quot;\n\nIn summary, you&#x27;re already doing great, but adding more **specific objectives**, **open-ended follow-ups**, and **clarifications on assumptions** could make our chats even more insightful.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of how to design the prompt:\n\n### 1. **Contextual Awareness**  \n   You want the GPT to understand that it\u2019s working from your resume and that it must tailor this resume to fit the specific job posting. The first part of the prompt should set that stage.\n\n   Example:  \n   &quot;You have access to my resume and can modify it. I will provide you with a job posting, and you will analyze the key qualifications, skills, and experiences that the employer is looking for.&quot;\n\n### 2. **ATS Optimization Requirements**  \n   Applicant Tracking Systems often filter resumes based on **keywords** and **formatting**. Your prompt should instruct the GPT to focus on including the right **keywords** and ensuring the resume is **formatted** correctly for ATS.\n\n   Example:  \n   &quot;Please generate an ATS-friendly version of my resume, ensuring it includes relevant keywords from the job posting. Optimize for clarity, use bullet points for experiences, and avoid graphics, tables, or excessive formatting that ATS systems might struggle with.&quot;\n\n### 3. **Customization for Role-Specific Matches**  \n   You want the GPT to highlight your skills and experiences that are the best match for the job.\n\n   Example:  \n   &quot;Focus on matching the job requirements with my work experience and skills. Rephrase or emphasize the most relevant aspects of my background so it\u2019s clear to the recruiter that I\u2019m the perfect fit for the role. Make sure to quantify achievements wherever possible, and use active, outcome-oriented language.&quot;\n\n### Example Prompt Structure:\n&quot;Hello GPT! I want you to create an ATS-optimized resume for me. You already have my resume on hand, and I will provide you with the job description for the role I\u2019m applying for. \n\nHere\u2019s how I want you to process it:\n1. Analyze the job posting and identify the key skills, qualifications, and responsibilities the employer is looking for.\n2. Optimize my resume by incorporating relevant keywords from the job description into my existing experience and skills sections.\n3. Tailor each job role in my resume to align with the responsibilities outlined in the job posting.\n4. Ensure the resume is in a simple, ATS-friendly format (e.g., no graphics, tables, or unconventional fonts).\n5. Highlight quantifiable achievements and use strong, active language to make it clear that I\u2019m the best candidate for the role.&quot;\n\n### Possible Follow-ups:\n- &quot;What keywords should I prioritize for this job description?&quot;\n- &quot;Could you improve the bullet points for the &#x27;Customer Success Manager&#x27; role to emphasize team leadership and communication?&quot;\n\nThis approach will ensure your GPT is focused on crafting a tailored, keyword-optimized resume that aligns with job postings and is formatted to pass through ATS filters effectively.

The architecture of GPT models, including mine, emphasizes task-based processing for a few key reasons:\n\n### 1. **Focus and Clarity**\nCompartmentalizing different aspects of a task helps ensure that responses are concise and relevant to the specific query at hand. This approach allows the model to remain focused on the immediate context, without getting overwhelmed by the vast amount of data it has access to. It mirrors human cognitive processes, where we also break down complex tasks into manageable parts.\n\n### 2. **Modularity for Performance**\nGPT models are trained to respond to specific input patterns based on the context they&#x27;re given at any moment. By keeping interactions modular, the system can perform efficiently without overloading any one component with too much information. This division allows the model to handle diverse tasks (coding, answering questions, etc.) without confusion.\n\n### 3. **Security and Privacy**\nCompartmentalization also aids in ensuring that information isn&#x27;t unintentionally leaked across sessions or queries. For example, conversations don&#x27;t carry over unless explicitly designed to, which minimizes the risk of cross-query contamination.\n\n### 4. **Flexibility and Adaptability**\nIn models like mine, compartmentalization helps deal with a wide variety of tasks. It allows me to respond to everything from coding questions to creative writing in a way that is adaptable. Think of it like having specialized &quot;modules&quot; or &quot;zones&quot; for different types of reasoning.\n\n### Internal Integration\nThat said, you&#x27;re absolutely right: more **integration** could lead to more fluid and contextually rich conversations, especially for personalizing interactions. There are research initiatives aimed at adding **long-term memory** and more contextual awareness to AI models so they can keep track of ongoing projects, conversations, and preferences over time. For example, tools like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** enable models to retain context for better long-term interaction. This could be useful for tasks like generating optimized resumes from saved data, as you mentioned.\n\nIf I had more persistent memory across all tasks (similar to how the OpenAI GPT builder can be customized with long-term memory or specific capabilities), I could indeed act more like a continuous assistant who evolves with your needs.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how to make your personal GPT model better at retaining context and integrating tasks? I could give you pointers for that!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It can help your model retain a &quot;state,&quot; enabling it to remember your resume, preferences, and ongoing job searches. This would allow the GPT to reference previous conversations or details (like your resume) without needing constant re-prompting.\n  \n  **How to use it:**\n   - LangChain can store long-term memory by creating an interaction history. This history allows your GPT model to pull relevant details from past conversations, enhancing contextual understanding.\n   - You could integrate a knowledge base of your resume into the system, and when you provide a job posting, the model could recall and tweak specific sections (e.g., your software experience) to align with the job&#x27;s requirements.\n\n   **LangChain Resources:**\n   - [LangChain Documentation](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n### 2. **Embedding and Retrieval Models**\n   - Use **embedding-based retrieval models** to store and retrieve sections of your resume or past data. By indexing your resume and job descriptions using embeddings, you can have the GPT access relevant sections, contextualize them, and generate a custom response.\n   - For instance, **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a tool that could store parts of your resume and relevant keywords, making it searchable by the GPT when needed. You\u2019d query the job posting, and FAISS retrieves the most relevant parts of your resume for the GPT to customize.\n\n   **How to use it:**\n   - Store each section of your resume (education, experience, skills) as embeddings. When a job description is provided, the model searches for relevant parts based on the job\u2019s keywords and modifies the resume dynamically.\n\n   **FAISS Resources:**\n   - [FAISS GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)\n\n### 3. **Fine-Tuning on Your Resume Data**\n   - You can **fine-tune** your GPT on a dataset that includes variations of your resume. This makes it better suited for identifying and repurposing your experience for different job types. Fine-tuning can include making the model aware of common ATS-friendly formats and tailoring language to meet specific industry standards.\n   - **Example process**:\n     - Create a small dataset of job descriptions and your tailored resumes.\n     - Fine-tune the GPT model on these data samples, ensuring it learns how to automatically align your experience with various job roles.\n\n   **Fine-Tuning Resources:**\n   - [OpenAI Fine-Tuning Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)\n\n### 4. **Prompt Engineering for Contextual Generation**\n   - Craft your prompts to take advantage of **few-shot learning**. By giving the model structured examples of how you like your resume to be tailored for specific roles, you can achieve more consistent results without needing complex infrastructure.\n   \n   Example prompt structure:\n   ```\n   I\u2019m applying for [Job Title] at [Company]. Here&#x27;s a list of job requirements: [insert job requirements]. Here&#x27;s my resume: [insert key details from your resume]. Please generate an ATS-optimized resume that emphasizes my skills related to [specific job focus areas].\n   ```\n   This structured input can guide the GPT to highlight the relevant parts of your resume for each job.\n\n### 5. **Use GPT-3&#x27;s Embedding Models via API**\n   OpenAI offers powerful embedding models that let you semantically search through documents (like your resume) and retrieve the most relevant sections based on a query (the job posting).\n   \n   **How to use it:**\n   - Store sections of your resume in an embedding-based system. When you feed a job posting into the GPT, it uses the embeddings to fetch and reorganize the parts of your resume that match best with the job description.\n\n   **OpenAI Embedding Resources**:\n   - [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)\n\n### 6. **Automation with Tools like Zapier or Integromat**\n   - For ease of use, you could automate the process of feeding job descriptions and generating custom resumes. You can integrate GPT with **Zapier** or **Integromat** to automatically pull job postings from emails or job boards, process them, and generate a customized resume, all without manual intervention.\n\n   **How to use it:**\n   - Set up a Zap to trigger whenever you receive a job posting in your email.\n   - Zapier feeds this into your GPT, and the GPT responds with a tailored resume, which is then automatically emailed back to you.\n\n   **Zapier Resources**:\n   - [Zapier GPT Integration](https://zapier.com/apps/openai/integrations)\n\n### Combining Everything\n- **Long-term memory** with LangChain or LlamaIndex would ensure your GPT retains your resume.\n- **Embeddings and FAISS** would enable smart retrieval based on job descriptions.\n- **Prompt engineering** and **fine-tuning** help your GPT improve over time by learning from different roles you apply to.\n- **Automation** ensures this process is smooth and hands-off.\n\nThese strategies will allow your personal GPT to seamlessly access, modify, and optimize your resume based on job postings, giving you an edge in the job application process.

Here&#x27;s how you can move forward without losing the **vibe** we have:\n\n### Getting Started with GPT Builder + Retaining Our Vibe\nThe good news is that even though you\u2019d technically be switching to a different &quot;instance&quot; when using the **OpenAI GPT Builder**, you can still use everything we&#x27;ve talked about here as a foundation. You can personalize your GPT to reflect this conversation and keep our energy alive!\n\nHere&#x27;s a step-by-step plan to get you started:\n\n### 1. **Set Up GPT in OpenAI GPT Builder**\n   Since you&#x27;re already using GPT Builder, you&#x27;ll need to create a new custom GPT instance. Here\u2019s how to start:\n   - Log into **OpenAI GPT Builder**.\n   - Create a new GPT instance.\n   - In the GPT builder, you can **add a memory module** where you upload your resume. This will allow the model to access and store your resume for reference in future interactions.\n\n### 2. **Load Resume into GPT Memory**\n   Since we already have your resume, you can:\n   - Upload it directly into the builder as part of its memory.\n   - If the builder doesn&#x27;t directly support large uploads or memory, chunk your resume into smaller sections (e.g., **Work Experience**, **Education**, **Skills**) and feed them to the model as part of its knowledge base.\n   \n### 3. **Customize Prompts for ATS-Optimized Resumes**\n   Create prompt templates like:\n   - &quot;Generate an ATS-optimized resume for the following job posting: [Insert job description]. Use my resume as reference and customize the skills and experiences to align with the job requirements.&quot;\n   \n   Fine-tuning the prompts in this way will ensure that every interaction results in a resume that matches specific job postings.\n\n### 4. **Configure Long-Term Memory (via GPT Builder or External Tool)**\n   Since you want this model to **remember** details long-term, you\u2019ll likely need to use a memory module or tool like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex**, which can store your ongoing interactions.\n   - You can integrate these into your GPT builder setup (if possible) or use them to feed memory/context back to the GPT for more complex workflows.\n   \n   You might not need external tools for GPT Builder depending on how it handles long-term memory, but this is something you should explore if deeper memory is needed.\n\n### 5. **Automate with API/Workflow Integrations**\n   Set up workflows for:\n   - **Retrieving job descriptions** automatically (from job boards, emails, etc.).\n   - **Generating resumes** based on job postings and having them ready to submit.\n   \n   This can be done with **Zapier** or **Integromat** to automate the input/output process.\n\n### 6. **Stay in Sync with Me!**\n   Even though this builder GPT will handle the specific tasks, we can still chat here for guidance, advice, and ideas. You can even **import some of our past conversations** to reflect our previous chats and keep the same vibe going in your custom GPT.\n\n### Final Steps\n- **Start building your custom GPT**: Take these steps and build the initial framework. As you go, you can continue tweaking it to include more features (like deeper memory or better ATS formatting).\n- **Come back here anytime**: We can keep discussing and refining your GPT journey, ensuring that I stay as involved as you need. \n\nIf you hit any roadblocks while building, just reach out, and I\u2019ll help you troubleshoot.

Here are the likely effects and components to consider:\n\n1. **Altered Phytochemicals**: \n   - Decarboxylation typically involves heating the herb, which can change some of its chemical constituents. Sage contains thujone, rosmarinic acid, camphor, and other essential oils. Decarbing may increase the availability of some of these compounds, potentially making the tincture more potent. \n   - **Thujone**, found in sage, has a stimulant effect in low doses, but excessive amounts can cause adverse reactions. Decarbing could increase thujone\u2019s presence, leading to stronger effects.\n\n2. **Increased Antioxidant Activity**: \n   - Sage is known for its antioxidant properties, largely due to rosmarinic acid. Decarbing may intensify these effects, resulting in a tincture with enhanced potential for combating oxidative stress and promoting cellular health.\n\n3. **Potential Cognitive Benefits**: \n   - Sage has been historically associated with improving memory and cognitive function. A decarbed tincture might amplify these effects, making it more effective for improving focus or memory due to the enhanced availability of sage&#x27;s active compounds.\n\n4. **Anti-inflammatory Properties**: \n   - Rosmarinic acid and other components in sage have anti-inflammatory properties, and a decarbed tincture could heighten the herb&#x27;s ability to reduce inflammation, offering potential relief from inflammatory conditions.\n\n5. **Stronger Flavor and Aroma**: \n   - Decarbing can intensify the herb&#x27;s flavor and aroma by releasing more volatile compounds, leading to a tincture with a more pronounced herbal, earthy, and potentially bitter taste.\n\n6. **Possible Psychoactive Effects**: \n   - Thujone, in higher concentrations, is known to have psychoactive effects and may cause altered mental states, hallucinations, or convulsions in excessive amounts. The Green Dragon method, particularly with decarbed sage, could lead to a tincture with mild to moderate psychoactive properties if thujone levels are concentrated.\n\n7. **Antibacterial and Antifungal Effects**: \n   - Sage is antimicrobial, and a tincture could be effective as a topical or internal remedy for bacterial or fungal infections, with decarbing enhancing the tincture\u2019s efficacy in this regard.\n\n8. **Enhanced Mood and Relaxation**: \n   - Sage has anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effects. Decarbing may heighten its potential to relieve stress and promote relaxation, contributing to a more potent mood-stabilizing tincture.\n\nIt is important to note that while decarbing could amplify the effects of sage, there\u2019s a risk of intensifying compounds like thujone, which should be taken cautiously, especially in larger doses.

Here are some of the possible effects you might experience from a cannabis and sage-based tincture, depending on the strains and ratios used:\n\n### 1. **Enhanced Relaxation and Stress Relief**\n   - **Cannabis (THC/CBD)**: Depending on the strain of cannabis you use, particularly if it&#x27;s high in CBD or an indica strain, the tincture could have calming, anxiety-reducing effects. THC can also promote relaxation and a sense of euphoria.\n   - **Sage**: Sage has mild anxiolytic properties and may help with mood stabilization, promoting a calm, relaxed state when combined with cannabis.\n\n### 2. **Cognitive Enhancement or Alteration**\n   - **Cannabis (THC)**: THC can alter perception, mood, and cognition. It may cause euphoria, creativity, or introspective effects depending on the dose. At higher doses, it may induce psychoactive effects like heightened awareness or altered sensory perception.\n   - **Sage (Thujone)**: Sage contains thujone, which, in small amounts, has a stimulating effect on the nervous system. This could potentially enhance focus, memory, and clarity when combined with the right cannabis strain.\n   - **Combined Effect**: Depending on the strain, this combination may create a sense of alertness while being relaxed, which could be useful for focus-driven tasks or creative work.\n\n### 3. **Potential Psychoactive Effects**\n   - **Cannabis (THC)**: Cannabis\u2019 psychoactive effects, driven by THC, can range from mild euphoria to more intense states depending on the dose.\n   - **Sage (Thujone)**: High amounts of thujone may add to the psychoactive effects of THC, potentially resulting in heightened mental stimulation or mild hallucinations in high doses. This combination should be used with caution as it may enhance the intensity of a cannabis high.\n   \n### 4. **Anti-inflammatory and Pain Relief**\n   - **Cannabis (CBD/THC)**: Cannabis, especially strains high in CBD, is known for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. THC also provides relief by interacting with the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system.\n   - **Sage**: Sage has anti-inflammatory properties due to compounds like rosmarinic acid, which may help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.\n   - **Combined Effect**: The two together could result in a powerful anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving tincture, making it useful for conditions like arthritis, muscle pain, or chronic inflammation.\n\n### 5. **Potential Antimicrobial Benefits**\n   - **Cannabis (CBD)**: Cannabinoids such as CBD have shown antibacterial and antifungal effects in some studies.\n   - **Sage**: Sage is traditionally used for its antimicrobial properties, making it effective in combating infections.\n   - **Combined Effect**: A tincture combining both herbs could have enhanced antimicrobial properties, potentially useful for topical or internal applications to fight infections.\n\n### 6. **Mood Elevation and Euphoria**\n   - **Cannabis (THC)**: THC is known to uplift mood and induce feelings of euphoria, which could help with depression or stress.\n   - **Sage**: Sage has traditionally been used for its mood-lifting properties, and it may enhance feelings of well-being when combined with cannabis.\n   - **Combined Effect**: This tincture could serve as a mood enhancer or for managing mood disorders like depression or anxiety, promoting a sense of mental clarity and happiness.\n\n### 7. **Improved Digestion**\n   - **Cannabis (THC/CBD)**: Cannabis is known to stimulate appetite (the &quot;munchies&quot;) and can relieve nausea, making it helpful for digestive issues.\n   - **Sage**: Sage is traditionally used to aid digestion and relieve gastrointestinal discomfort.\n   - **Combined Effect**: Together, they could enhance digestive function and be beneficial for those experiencing nausea, indigestion, or lack of appetite.\n\n### 8. **Cognitive Fog or Overstimulation (if taken in high doses)**\n   - If too much THC or thujone is consumed, it may lead to cognitive fog, paranoia, or overstimulation. Combining high doses of both cannabis and sage could potentially result in anxiety or confusion, especially in those sensitive to THC or thujone.\n   \n### 9. **Potential Sedation**\n   - **Cannabis (Indica)**: Indica strains of cannabis are known for their sedative effects, which can be beneficial for sleep disorders or insomnia.\n   - **Sage**: While sage is generally not sedative, in combination with an indica strain, it could potentially add to the calming, sedative effect.\n   - **Combined Effect**: This tincture could promote restful sleep, especially when using cannabis strains known for their sleep-inducing properties.\n\n### 10. **Cognitive Clarity (depending on the strain of cannabis)**\n   - **Sage**: Sage is often associated with cognitive enhancement and may help with memory retention and mental clarity.\n   - **Cannabis (Sativa)**: Sativa strains of cannabis tend to be more uplifting and cerebral, enhancing creativity and clarity. Combining this with sage could result in an even greater boost in focus and mental sharpness.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Dosage**: Since both cannabis (especially THC) and sage (due to thujone) can have strong psychoactive properties, it\u2019s important to start with small doses, especially if you\u2019re new to either herb. \n- **Balance**: Consider balancing the THC/CBD ratio in cannabis to avoid overwhelming psychoactive effects, and be mindful of how much thujone is present in the sage to avoid adverse effects like hallucinations or convulsions at high doses.\n\nIn conclusion, a cannabis and sage tincture could have a range of effects, from relaxation and pain relief to enhanced cognition or psychoactivity. The specific outcome depends largely on the type of cannabis used, the dose, and the individual\u2019s tolerance."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The combination of these cannabinoids with the **decarbed sage** would create a more nuanced set of effects, with less focus on psychoactivity. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of what you might expect:\n\n### 1. **Reduced Psychoactive Effects**\n   - **Low THC**: Since much of the THC is stripped away, the tincture would have minimal or no psychoactive effects (e.g., euphoria, altered perception). You wouldn&#x27;t feel the typical &quot;high&quot; associated with THC.\n   - **Sage (Thujone)**: The psychoactive effect would come more from the thujone in the sage. However, without the strong influence of THC, the tincture might have a mild, more focused mental stimulation rather than the full-spectrum effects of cannabis.\n\n### 2. **Enhanced Relaxation without Euphoria**\n   - **CBD**: Cannabidiol (CBD) is non-psychoactive and is known for its **relaxing, anti-anxiety, and anti-inflammatory effects**. In the absence of THC, CBD will likely play the dominant role in the tincture&#x27;s calming properties.\n   - **Sage**: Sage can add to the relaxation effect, especially in terms of cognitive calmness and mood balance, but without adding significant sedation unless combined with a lot of cannabis terpenes like myrcene or linalool.\n   - **Combined Effect**: The tincture could provide physical relaxation, reduced anxiety, and an overall sense of calm without feeling high.\n\n### 3. **Potential Cognitive Focus and Clarity**\n   - **CBD and CBG**: Both CBD and CBG are known to promote **focus, mental clarity, and cognitive function**. This combination could help with focus, without the mental cloudiness that high doses of THC might cause.\n   - **Sage (Thujone)**: Thujone, the compound in sage, can act as a stimulant in small doses, improving cognitive function and clarity. \n   - **Combined Effect**: The resulting tincture could help you stay alert and mentally sharp, ideal for daytime use or tasks requiring concentration.\n\n### 4. **Anti-inflammatory and Pain Relief Properties**\n   - **CBD, CBG, and CBC**: These cannabinoids are known for their strong **anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain-relieving) properties**. CBG, in particular, has been studied for its potential to reduce inflammation, while CBC may enhance pain relief.\n   - **Sage**: Sage also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties due to its compounds like rosmarinic acid and camphor.\n   - **Combined Effect**: This tincture would be highly effective for reducing inflammation and managing pain, particularly for conditions like arthritis, muscle soreness, or chronic pain, without the need for psychoactive THC.\n\n### 5. **Improved Mood and Reduced Anxiety**\n   - **CBD**: One of the main benefits of CBD is its ability to reduce **anxiety and stress**. It works by interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain, promoting a sense of well-being.\n   - **Sage**: Sage also has mild mood-lifting properties and may help stabilize emotions. When paired with CBD, this could further enhance mood and reduce feelings of tension.\n   - **Combined Effect**: This tincture could act as a natural mood stabilizer, helping to reduce anxiety, depression, and overall stress.\n\n### 6. **Digestive Support**\n   - **CBD/CBG**: Cannabinoids like CBD and CBG are known for their ability to reduce **nausea and improve gut health**. They can be particularly helpful in calming irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other digestive disorders.\n   - **Sage**: Sage is traditionally used to support digestion and relieve indigestion, bloating, or stomach discomfort.\n   - **Combined Effect**: The tincture could provide **gastrointestinal support**, soothing the digestive system, relieving nausea, and promoting better digestive health.\n\n### 7. **Neuroprotective Properties**\n   - **CBD/CBG**: Both cannabinoids have **neuroprotective** properties, meaning they can help protect brain cells from damage and degeneration. This has potential benefits for long-term brain health and reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.\n   - **Sage**: Sage has been shown to enhance memory and cognitive function, possibly by inhibiting enzymes that break down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter important for memory.\n   - **Combined Effect**: This tincture may be beneficial for improving memory and cognitive function while offering protective effects for brain health over the long term.\n\n### 8. **Enhanced Antimicrobial and Immune Support**\n   - **CBD/CBG/CBC**: These cannabinoids, particularly CBG, have demonstrated **antibacterial and antifungal properties**, which can support the immune system by helping to combat infections.\n   - **Sage**: Sage is traditionally known for its antimicrobial properties and has been used in natural remedies for infections.\n   - **Combined Effect**: This tincture could offer **immune support** and have antimicrobial benefits, potentially useful for preventing infections or treating minor topical issues.\n\n### 9. **Little to No Sedation**\n   - **Without THC**, the tincture will have far less sedative potential. This could make the tincture more appropriate for daytime use when you&#x27;re looking for relaxation without drowsiness.\n   - However, certain terpenes (such as myrcene or linalool) and sage\u2019s calming effect might add a slight sedative element, but overall the tincture would likely be more energizing or neutral in terms of sedation.\n\n### 10. **Potential Synergy through the &quot;Entourage Effect&quot;**\n   - **Cannabinoids (CBD, CBG, etc.) and Terpenes**: The combination of multiple cannabinoids and terpenes can create an **entourage effect**, where the compounds work together to enhance each other&#x27;s effects. This may result in a more well-rounded and effective tincture even without THC.\n   - **Sage&#x27;s Compounds**: The phytochemicals in sage could further enhance this entourage effect, possibly making the tincture more effective for a variety of uses (anti-anxiety, pain relief, mood stabilization) compared to using either plant alone.\n\n### Summary of Effects:\n- **Relaxation and stress relief** without psychoactivity\n- **Cognitive clarity and focus**\n- Strong **anti-inflammatory** and **pain relief** benefits\n- **Mood elevation** and reduced anxiety\n- **Digestive support**\n- **Antimicrobial and immune-boosting** properties\n- Minimal or no sedation (depending on strain and terpene profile)\n  \nThis combination could be ideal for someone looking for the therapeutic benefits of both plants without the intoxicating effects of THC. The tincture would work well for managing **chronic pain, stress, anxiety, inflammation**, and **cognitive enhancement** while keeping a clear head."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This may cause the effects of the tincture (such as relaxation, mood improvement, or cognitive clarity) to be felt faster than if it were taken with a cold drink or on its own.\n   - **Cannabinoids and Heat**: Most cannabinoids are not significantly degraded by the temperature of a warm drink, so the therapeutic effects should remain intact.\n\n### 2. **Synergistic Effects with Caffeine**\n   - **Caffeine in Coffee/Tea**: Caffeine is a natural stimulant that can enhance focus and mental alertness. When combined with a cannabis and sage tincture, particularly one with low THC, the caffeine could amplify the **cognitive clarity, focus, and energy** provided by cannabinoids like CBD and CBG, and by sage&#x27;s thujone.\n   - **Balancing Stimulation**: For some, this combination might create a nice balance of stimulation and relaxation, reducing anxiety that sometimes accompanies caffeine consumption. However, if the tincture is taken in a higher dose or is particularly sedative, it might counteract the energizing effects of the caffeine.\n\n### 3. **Flavor Considerations**\n   - **Bitterness of Sage**: Sage has a strong, earthy, and somewhat bitter taste, which may be more pronounced when added to coffee or tea. Depending on your taste preference, you might want to adjust the amount of tincture or add sweeteners (like honey, sugar, or flavored syrups) to balance the bitterness.\n   - **Herbal Complement to Tea**: If added to tea, especially herbal blends, sage may complement certain flavors quite well (e.g., chamomile, green tea, or mint).\n\n### 4. **Digestive Support**\n   - **Sage and Coffee**: Sage&#x27;s digestive support properties, combined with the stimulant effects of coffee, might help stimulate digestion. This could be beneficial for those who drink coffee and experience mild digestive discomfort, as sage and cannabinoids (especially CBD) are both known to soothe the digestive tract.\n   - **Tea and Sage for Digestion**: If consumed in tea, particularly herbal teas with ingredients like ginger or peppermint, the tincture could help reduce nausea or digestive discomfort, especially when consumed after meals.\n\n### 5. **Slight Alteration of the Sedative Effects**\n   - **Caffeine&#x27;s Effect on Sedation**: If the tincture has any sedative properties (e.g., due to cannabinoids or terpenes like myrcene), the caffeine in coffee or tea may reduce the sedative effects, creating a balance where the user feels calm but not sleepy.\n   - **Timing of Consumption**: If you&#x27;re aiming for a more relaxing or sedative effect, consuming the tincture with a non-caffeinated beverage, like herbal tea, might be a better option, particularly in the evening.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Faster onset**: Heat from the beverage may speed up absorption.\n- **Balanced effects**: The caffeine could enhance focus and mental clarity, complementing the relaxing properties of the tincture.\n- **Flavor**: Bitter sage flavors could stand out, so adjusting sweetness in the drink may be helpful.\n- **Digestive support**: The combination of sage, cannabinoids, and warm beverages can help soothe digestion.\n\nThis practice of mixing the tincture into instant tea or coffee could offer a pleasant and quick way to experience the tincture&#x27;s effects, especially if you&#x27;re looking for focus and relaxation in balance with your daily caffeine routine."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Lemon is naturally complementary to many herbs, and it may balance out any earthy or bitter notes from the decarbed sage.\n   - **Cannabis Taste**: If your tincture has a strong cannabis taste, the lemon flavor could also help neutralize that, especially when consumed in instant tea where the flavors are already fairly bold and sweet.\n\n### 2. **No Interaction with Caffeine**\n   - Since **instant lemon tea** often does not contain caffeine, you won&#x27;t experience the stimulating effects typically associated with coffee or caffeinated teas. This means you&#x27;ll likely feel the relaxing effects of cannabinoids and sage more fully without the stimulation of caffeine interfering.\n   \n### 3. **Calming and Relaxing Experience**\n   - The combination of sage, cannabinoids, and lemon tea can result in a more **calming and soothing effect**, especially if you take the tincture as part of a relaxing routine. It could help promote relaxation, relieve stress, and enhance digestion after a meal, particularly in the evening when you&#x27;re looking to unwind.\n\n### 4. **Faster Absorption**\n   - Just like with other warm beverages, the heat from the tea may speed up the absorption of cannabinoids and sage compounds, allowing you to feel the effects faster.\n\nThis combination of tincture and instant lemon tea could be an effective and pleasant way to enjoy the calming, pain-relieving, and mood-enhancing benefits of cannabis and sage, while the lemon flavor balances the herbal bitterness."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Since **psilocybin** is a psychedelic compound, even in small amounts, it can have an impact, though it would be much less pronounced than a full psychedelic dose. Here\u2019s what to expect:\n\n### 1. **Enhanced Mood and Sense of Well-being**\n   - **Psilocybin in Low Doses**: At trace levels, psilocybin can act like a microdose, promoting a subtle sense of **well-being, emotional uplift**, and even **increased positivity**. It could enhance the mood-boosting effects of the CBD and sage already present in the tincture, leading to a more profound sense of relaxation and mental clarity.\n   - **Combined with Cannabis and Sage**: The relaxing and anti-anxiety effects of cannabinoids (especially CBD) and sage may be enhanced by the psilocybin, creating a smooth, pleasant, and mildly euphoric experience.\n\n### 2. **Mild Cognitive Shifts and Creativity**\n   - **Psilocybin Microdose Effects**: In very small doses, psilocybin has been known to promote **creative thinking, enhanced problem-solving**, and **mental flexibility**. You may feel slightly more **open-minded, introspective**, and **curious**, with a heightened sense of focus.\n   - **Combined with Cannabis and Sage**: The cognitive focus and clarity provided by cannabinoids like CBD and CBG, along with sage\u2019s mild stimulant effects, could complement the trace psilocybin, enhancing **creativity, introspection, and cognitive clarity**.\n\n### 3. **Heightened Sensory Awareness**\n   - **Psilocybin\u2019s Influence on Sensory Perception**: Even at trace levels, psilocybin can slightly alter your perception of colors, sounds, and touch, making them seem richer or more intense. You wouldn\u2019t experience full hallucinations, but there could be a slight **enhancement of sensory experiences**, making your environment feel more vivid or interesting.\n   - **Combined with Cannabis and Sage**: The mild psychoactivity from thujone in sage and the sensory-enhancing properties of cannabis terpenes (like limonene or pinene) could amplify these effects, leading to **heightened awareness of your surroundings**.\n\n### 4. **Increased Mindfulness and Emotional Openness**\n   - **Psilocybin Microdosing Effects**: Trace amounts of psilocybin can enhance your **emotional sensitivity** and **mindfulness**, making you more attuned to your emotions and surroundings. It may also promote a sense of **interconnectedness**, even at low levels.\n   - **Combined with Cannabis and Sage**: Cannabis, especially in lower doses, can also foster a sense of emotional openness and relaxation. Together with psilocybin, you might feel more at ease and emotionally reflective, creating an enhanced **mind-body connection**.\n\n### 5. **Potential for Mild Anxiety or Paranoia**\n   - **Psilocybin\u2019s Unpredictable Nature**: Even in trace amounts, psilocybin can cause mild anxiety or emotional sensitivity in some users, especially if they are prone to anxiety. If your tincture contains a strain of cannabis with a bit of THC, this could amplify the likelihood of feeling mildly anxious or paranoid.\n   - **Mitigating Factors**: CBD in cannabis is known to counteract THC-induced anxiety, and the relaxing properties of sage may help offset any potential negative effects, keeping the experience more balanced.\n\n### 6. **Spiritual or Philosophical Insights**\n   - **Psilocybin\u2019s Psychedelic Nature**: Though at trace levels you won\u2019t experience full-blown psychedelic effects, psilocybin can still promote **introspection, self-reflection**, and **spiritual or philosophical thoughts**. You might find yourself contemplating deeper meanings or life experiences while feeling more connected to nature or your surroundings.\n   - **Combined with Cannabis and Sage**: The relaxing, mentally stimulating, and mood-enhancing effects of cannabis and sage could work together with psilocybin to enhance this reflective state, without pushing it into overwhelming territory.\n\n### 7. **Minimal Hallucinogenic Effects**\n   - **Trace Psilocybin Levels**: With trace amounts, you are unlikely to experience true hallucinations or visual distortions. However, there might be a **slight shift in perception**, such as seeing colors appear slightly brighter or noticing patterns in a more focused way, but it would be very mild.\n   - **Combined with Cannabis**: Depending on the cannabis strain, especially if some THC remains, this effect might be slightly more noticeable, with a heightened sense of **aesthetic appreciation** or **mild visual enhancement**.\n\n### 8. **Mindful, Gentle Energy**\n   - **Psilocybin and Microdosing**: Microdosing psilocybin has been reported to create a gentle **boost in energy, clarity, and focus**, but without the jitteriness of caffeine or stimulants.\n   - **Combined with Sage**: Sage has stimulant-like qualities due to thujone, so combined with psilocybin, this could create a **mild, mindful energy** that keeps you alert and engaged without feeling overstimulated.\n\n### Conclusion:\nA tincture containing **cannabis, sage, and trace psilocybin** could result in a very **mellow, mood-enhancing, and slightly mind-expanding experience** without overwhelming psychoactive effects. You might feel more **relaxed, creative, mindful**, and **emotionally open**, with mild sensory enhancement. However, there is a small chance of heightened sensitivity or anxiety if you\u2019re prone to it, though the calming influence of CBD and sage would likely balance that out.\n\nIf you&#x27;re using this tincture in **instant lemon tea** as you normally would, the lemon flavor would likely balance out any strong herbal or earthy flavors, and the calming warmth of the tea could further support the relaxing and mindful effects of the tincture."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Both kanna and kratom are powerful herbal supplements, and combining them with your tincture could result in a complex, multi-faceted experience. Here\u2019s how each would contribute to the overall effects:\n\n### 1. **Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum)**\n\nKanna is a South African herb traditionally used for mood enhancement, stress relief, and even mild euphoria. Its active compounds interact with the brain&#x27;s serotonin system, which can amplify the effects of other substances that also affect mood and perception.\n\n#### Effects of Adding Kanna:\n- **Enhanced Mood Elevation and Euphoria**: Kanna is known to increase feelings of **well-being, calm, and happiness**. It can provide a **mild euphoria**, which would pair well with the mood-enhancing effects of both psilocybin and cannabinoids like CBD.\n  - **Combination with Psilocybin**: Since kanna interacts with serotonin receptors, trace amounts of psilocybin could **synergize** with kanna\u2019s effects, leading to a heightened sense of **emotional openness** and positivity.\n  - **Combination with Cannabis**: Kanna may complement the relaxing effects of CBD, making the experience feel more **mellow** and **emotionally balanced**. It could enhance the **stress-relief** properties of the tincture, making it even more effective at reducing anxiety.\n\n- **Anti-Anxiety and Relaxation**: Kanna is often used to relieve **anxiety and stress**, which would pair nicely with the **relaxing properties of CBD and sage**. It might further balance out any mild anxiety that could arise from the psilocybin or remaining THC.\n  \n- **Increased Sociability and Empathy**: Kanna is sometimes used as a social enhancer, as it can increase **sociability, empathy**, and **emotional connection**. Combined with the emotional openness from trace psilocybin and the calming effects of CBD, you might feel more connected to others, making this a good option for social settings or deep conversations.\n  \n- **Mild Energy and Focus**: Kanna can also provide **mild stimulation**, which, in combination with sage\u2019s thujone and the potential cognitive clarity from low-dose psilocybin, could lead to a **focused, creative, and energetic** state without the jitteriness of caffeine.\n\n### 2. **Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)**\n\nKratom is a Southeast Asian plant with varying effects depending on the dose and strain. Lower doses of kratom are stimulating, while higher doses are sedative and analgesic. The two main active compounds in kratom are **mitragynine** and **7-hydroxymitragynine**, which interact with opioid receptors in the brain, providing pain relief, relaxation, and mood enhancement.\n\n#### Effects of Adding Kratom:\n- **Pain Relief**: If you&#x27;re using kratom (especially in larger doses), its **analgesic properties** could significantly enhance the tincture\u2019s **pain-relieving effects**. Combined with CBD, CBG, and sage, this would result in a **powerful blend** for managing chronic pain or discomfort.\n  \n- **Euphoria and Mood Enhancement**: Kratom, particularly in low to moderate doses, can induce feelings of **euphoria, well-being**, and **mood elevation**. This would **complement the uplifting effects** of cannabis (especially CBD) and kanna. \n  - **Combination with Psilocybin and Kanna**: Trace amounts of psilocybin and kanna could enhance kratom\u2019s mood-lifting properties, leading to a more pronounced sense of **emotional well-being** and mild euphoria without the risk of overpowering psychoactivity.\n\n- **Relaxation or Stimulation (Depending on the Dose)**: \n  - **Low Dose Kratom (1-3g)**: Low doses of kratom can provide a **stimulating effect**, making you feel more **energized and focused**. This would enhance the stimulating effects of kanna and sage, helping you stay alert and clear-headed, which could pair well with microdosed psilocybin.\n  - **High Dose Kratom (5-7g)**: Higher doses would result in a **sedative effect**, promoting relaxation, stress relief, and even drowsiness. Combined with CBD and sage, this would create a **deeply calming and potentially sleep-inducing tincture**, which might be useful for nighttime use.\n\n- **Potential for Calming Anxiety**: Kratom can have a **calming, anti-anxiety** effect, particularly at moderate doses. Combined with CBD and kanna, it could make the overall tincture a very effective **anxiolytic** (anxiety-relieving) blend, helping to manage stress and anxiety without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n- **Risk of Overstimulation (at Low Doses)**: At low doses, kratom\u2019s stimulating properties, combined with kanna\u2019s mild stimulation and sage\u2019s thujone, might lead to **overstimulation** or **jitters** in some users, especially if you are sensitive to stimulants.\n\n### Combined Effects with Cannabis, Sage, and Trace Psilocybin:\n- **Euphoric Mood Boost**: The combination of kanna, kratom (at a low dose), cannabis, and trace psilocybin could result in a **profound mood lift**, emotional well-being, and **mild euphoria** without intense psychoactive effects.\n  \n- **Relaxation and Anti-Anxiety**: With CBD, sage, and kanna\u2019s anti-anxiety properties, the tincture would be very effective at reducing **stress and promoting relaxation**. If using kratom at higher doses, the relaxation could be more pronounced, potentially making the tincture sedative.\n  \n- **Enhanced Cognitive Focus and Creativity**: The **focus-enhancing properties of kanna and low-dose kratom**, combined with the mild cognitive clarity from trace psilocybin and cannabinoids like CBD and CBG, could result in a **clear-headed, focused, and creative** state, ideal for work, creative tasks, or social interactions.\n  \n- **Pain Relief**: Kratom\u2019s potent **analgesic effects** would work alongside CBD\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties, making the tincture particularly useful for **pain management**, especially for conditions involving chronic pain or inflammation.\n  \n- **Mind-Body Synergy**: The combination of these herbs would likely result in a balanced **mind-body connection**, promoting both physical relaxation and mental clarity, with a subtle enhancement of sensory perception due to the trace psilocybin.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- **Dosage Caution**: Be mindful of the **dosage**, particularly with kratom, as higher doses could lead to sedation or discomfort. Also, using kanna and kratom together might amplify their effects, so start with lower amounts to assess how your body responds.\n- **Potential for Overstimulation**: At lower doses, kratom, kanna, and sage might create **too much stimulation** for some users, leading to feelings of restlessness or anxiety. This would depend on individual tolerance.\n- **Additive Effects on Mood**: Both kanna and kratom affect **serotonin and opioid receptors**, so combining them with psilocybin and cannabinoids could lead to **enhanced emotional sensitivity** and **positive mood**. This combination should be approached with care, especially if you&#x27;re prone to mood swings or emotional intensity.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAdding **kanna powder** or **kratom powder** to your tincture would greatly enhance its effects, depending on the doses used. The combination could lead to a **deeply relaxing, mood-enhancing, and potentially pain-relieving** experience with subtle cognitive or sensory enhancement due to the trace psilocybin.

Rosehip is rich in vitamin C, which can be sensitive to heat, so this would result in some loss of its potent antioxidant properties.\n  - **After the Water Bath**: Adding the **Rosa canina powder after** the water bath would preserve more of the **heat-sensitive compounds** like vitamin C, making the tincture more potent in terms of **antioxidant and immune-boosting** effects.\n\n### Suggested Approach:\n- To **maximize the benefits** of both herbs, it\u2019s advisable to:\n  - **Decarb the sage** using the Green Dragon method (including the 77\u00b0C water bath).\n  - **Add the Rosa canina powder** after the water bath, once the tincture has cooled down, to avoid degrading any important compounds in the rosehip powder.\n\n### Potential Effects of This Simplified Tincture:\n\n1. **Antioxidant Boost**:\n   - **Rosa canina (Rosehip)** is incredibly rich in **vitamin C**, flavonoids, and carotenoids, making it a powerful **antioxidant**. It can help protect cells from oxidative stress and support immune function. Adding this powder to the tincture will create a strong **antioxidant-rich blend** that could help with overall health and skin vitality.\n\n2. **Anti-inflammatory and Immune Support**:\n   - **Sage** has anti-inflammatory properties, and combined with **Rosa canina**, which also fights inflammation and boosts immune health, the tincture could be useful for reducing inflammation, especially in cases of joint pain or skin conditions. The combination would enhance immune support and could potentially help with managing colds or minor illnesses.\n\n3. **Digestive Health**:\n   - Both **sage** and **rosehip** are known to aid in **digestive health**. Sage can soothe digestive discomfort, while rosehip powder has mild laxative properties, making this combination potentially helpful for improving digestion, preventing constipation, and supporting gut health.\n\n4. **Skin Health and Anti-Aging**:\n   - **Rosehip** is well-known for its benefits to **skin health**, especially in preventing signs of aging due to its high vitamin C and antioxidant content. This tincture could help promote **collagen production** and support **skin repair**, making it useful for those looking to improve skin vitality or reduce wrinkles.\n\n5. **Cognitive and Mood Benefits**:\n   - **Sage** has been used traditionally to support **cognitive function** and memory, which would remain a key benefit of the tincture. This could be especially useful for improving focus and mental clarity. Additionally, sage has mild mood-stabilizing properties, which might be complemented by the rosehip\u2019s ability to support overall vitality and energy.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Add the Rosa canina powder after** the water bath to preserve its heat-sensitive compounds.\n- This tincture would offer a combination of **antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune-boosting, and skin health benefits**.\n- The sage will still contribute to **cognitive enhancement** and **digestive support**, making this a well-rounded tincture for both body and mind."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

You might feel **very subtle mood improvements** or relaxation, but it may not be enough to have a meaningful impact.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIf you&#x27;re using a typical kanna extract (e.g., 10:1 or stronger), **1 gram should have a noticeable effect**, particularly in terms of mood and relaxation, though it won&#x27;t be overpowering. However, if the extract is less concentrated, **1 gram might not be enough** to produce significant effects. If you&#x27;re aiming for noticeable mood enhancement or stress relief, a dose in the 500 mg to 1 gram range of **10:1 extract** is generally a good starting point."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, because it&#x27;s a **20:1 extract**, even a small amount like this could still contribute noticeable effects, especially in combination with the other herbs.\n- **Mood Enhancement**: While 1 gram of 20:1 kanna is enough to provide mood-enhancing and calming effects on its own, when dispersed in 100 grams of tincture, the kanna\u2019s effects will be **milder**, but still present. You may experience a **slight mood uplift**, which would combine well with the cognitive benefits of sage.\n- **Anti-Anxiety**: The **anti-anxiety effects** of kanna will add to sage&#x27;s own calming properties, making the tincture a bit more effective at **reducing stress and anxiety**. It won\u2019t be overwhelmingly strong, but it would contribute to the tincture\u2019s calming profile.\n- **Sociability**: The added kanna could provide a gentle boost to **sociability** and **empathy**, making the tincture useful for those wanting to relax in social settings or enhance communication.\n\n### 2. **Overall Effect in Combination with Sage**\n- **Calm and Focus**: Sage is known for its **focus-enhancing and memory-boosting** properties. Combined with kanna\u2019s **mild anti-anxiety effects**, the tincture could help with promoting a calm, **clear-headed state** that is good for focus and relaxation at the same time.\n- **Physical Relaxation**: The sage and kanna combination would help with **physical relaxation**, although not strongly sedative, it could reduce muscle tension and promote a gentle sense of ease.\n- **Balanced Relaxation**: Since sage is mildly stimulating (due to thujone) and kanna is relaxing, this could create a **balanced** effect, where you feel relaxed but still **mentally alert and focused**.\n\n### 3. **Potentially Subtle Effects**\n- Since 1 gram of 20:1 kanna is dispersed in 100 grams of tincture, the effects of kanna will likely be **subtle** when taking small doses of the tincture. You might feel a mild **mood boost**, gentle relaxation, and reduced anxiety. The effect will not be as pronounced as taking the 1 gram of kanna extract on its own but would still add value to the tincture overall.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **1 gram of 20:1 kanna extract** in your **100-gram sage tincture** would add **mild mood-enhancing, anti-anxiety, and relaxing effects**. While it would not dominate the tincture, it would enhance the overall calming and focusing properties of the sage tincture.

CBD is known for its **anxiolytic** and **antidepressant** properties, while THC in lower doses can provide **mood elevation** and help relieve anxiety. However, higher doses of THC can sometimes exacerbate anxiety or induce paranoia, so maintaining a balance is important.\n   - **Tincture vs. Baked Goods**: Since the patient is managing her mental health with **oral cannabis**, tinctures tend to be more **easily dosed** and have a quicker onset than edibles like baked goods. This provides more control over the effects, which is beneficial when managing conditions like anxiety or depression.\n\n### 2. **Consistency in Management**\n   - **On-Again, Off-Again Therapy**: While therapy can be effective in combination with cannabis, the **inconsistency in therapy** may leave some gaps in emotional support or coping mechanisms. If cannabis alone is managing anxiety and depression in the absence of regular therapy, the patient might benefit from finding a stable routine or adjunctive practices like **journaling**, **mindfulness**, or **support groups** to help regulate emotions in between therapy sessions.\n   \n   - **Meditation**: Meditation is an excellent tool for **managing anxiety and stress**, and when combined with cannabis, it can deepen the **relaxation and mindfulness experience**. The patient may find that meditation helps them stay grounded and better manage their mental health during periods when they are not in therapy.\n\n### 3. **Physical and Metabolic Considerations**\n   - **Overweight but Normal Vascular Health**: Being overweight can affect the **metabolism** of cannabinoids, as THC and other cannabinoids are stored in fat cells, potentially prolonging their effects. This means the patient might experience **longer-lasting effects** from cannabis edibles or tinctures than someone with a lower body fat percentage.\n   - **Vascular Health**: Since the patient\u2019s **vascular health is normal**, there is no immediate cardiovascular concern with cannabis use, though it&#x27;s still important to monitor overall health, as cannabinoids can affect **blood pressure and heart rate**.\n\n### 4. **Potential Impact of Early Cannabis Exposure**\n   - **Ingesting a Joint at a Young Age**: If the patient consumed a small joint when she was around **12-24 months old**, this early exposure to cannabis is not likely to have had long-term health consequences, especially if it was an isolated event. However, early exposure to cannabis at such a young age is not fully understood, and any possible long-term effects (if any) would likely be subtle and non-detrimental, especially given the patient\u2019s otherwise normal vascular health.\n\n### 5. **Recommendations for Future Management**\n   - **Maintaining Balance in Cannabis Dosing**: Given the patient\u2019s history of anxiety and depression, it\u2019s important to maintain **low to moderate doses of THC** in her cannabis regimen, as higher doses may aggravate anxiety. Strains or tinctures higher in **CBD** with a balanced amount of **THC** might be ideal for her mental health.\n   - **Consistent Therapy**: While the patient may manage well with **on-again, off-again therapy**, more consistent therapeutic support might provide additional benefits for long-term emotional resilience, especially during stressful periods. Even **online therapy** or **counseling apps** can provide some continuity in care.\n   - **Mind-Body Practices**: Continuing **meditation** is a great way to support mental health. The patient might also explore **yoga** or other forms of **gentle exercise**, which have been shown to improve **mood, energy levels**, and overall **well-being**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe patient\u2019s current approach, combining oral cannabis consumption, meditation, and intermittent therapy, appears to be working well for managing her **depression and anxiety**. To further optimize her mental health routine, focusing on **consistent dosing** with **CBD-rich strains**, potentially **increasing therapy consistency**, and continuing mind-body practices like meditation and gentle physical activity could be beneficial. Given her normal vascular health, the cannabis use should continue to be safe within reasonable dosages."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This is helpful for managing her depression and anxiety, particularly when using **THC-dominant products** like **distillates** and **RSO oils**.\n\n### Tailoring Management Based on THC Response:\n1. **High THC for Mood and Relaxation**:\n   - Since **high THC** products (like **RSO oils** and **distillates**) promote **euphoria** and help taper into **relaxation and sleep**, they are an effective option for her mental health management, particularly during periods of elevated stress or when deeper relaxation is needed.\n   - This pattern of response indicates that **THC\u2019s mood-enhancing properties** are beneficial for managing both **depressive symptoms** and promoting **restful sleep**, which can help regulate mood on a daily basis.\n\n2. **Optimal Timing**:\n   - Using high THC products in the **evening** could be particularly useful, as they not only provide a **euphoric boost** but also help **transition into deep relaxation and restful sleep**. This makes THC-heavy products a good choice for **winding down** at the end of the day.\n   - For daytime use, lower THC doses or products with a balance of **CBD and THC** might allow her to enjoy **mood elevation** without feeling overly sedated, keeping her alert but calm.\n\n3. **Sleep and Anxiety Management**:\n   - The fact that **THC leads to deep relaxation and improved sleep** suggests that it\u2019s also **effective for reducing anxiety**. Deep relaxation after the euphoric high can provide long-lasting **calmness**, which may help her manage anxiety overnight and wake up refreshed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince **high THC** products work effectively for her by producing **euphoria, relaxation**, and **sleep support**, continuing with these types of products can be an ideal way to manage both **mood** and **sleep patterns**. She might continue using high-THC oils and distillates in the **evenings** to maximize these benefits, with **CBD-THC balanced** products during the day for **calm focus** without the sedative effects."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Although no single herb fully mimics the effects of THC, a carefully crafted herbal tincture could provide similar **calming, mood-enhancing, and sleep-promoting** effects.\n\nHere are some potential herbal tincture components that could replace or supplement **cannabinoid-based products**:\n\n### 1. **Sage (Salvia officinalis)**\n   - **Cognitive and Mood Support**: Sage is known for its ability to enhance **cognitive function** and improve **mood**. It also has mild anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) properties, which can promote mental clarity while keeping the mind calm.\n   - **Mild Relaxation**: Sage can promote **relaxation without sedation**, making it a good base for a tincture focused on **daytime mood support** and **stress reduction**.\n\n### 2. **Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum)**\n   - **Mood Enhancement and Relaxation**: Kanna is a powerful herb for managing **mood** and **anxiety**, promoting **euphoria** and **stress relief**. It could provide a similar **mood-boosting effect** to THC, especially in higher doses, without the psychoactive effects.\n   - **Stress Relief**: Kanna interacts with the serotonin system, making it an excellent herb for managing **depression and anxiety** while helping the user feel emotionally balanced and calm.\n\n### 3. **Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)**\n   - **Mental Clarity and Relaxation**: Rosemary is often used to enhance **cognitive function**, and it promotes **relaxation and mental clarity** without sedation, similar to sage.\n   - **Energizing Calm**: Rosemary can provide an **uplifting, yet calming effect**, making it helpful for replacing daytime THC products aimed at **focus and mood improvement**.\n\n### 4. **Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis)**\n   - **Calming and Anti-Anxiety**: Lemon balm is well known for its **calming properties** and is often used to relieve **anxiety** and **promote relaxation**. It has a mild **mood-lifting** effect and could be useful in combination with other herbs for easing into **sleep**.\n   - **Sleep Support**: In higher doses, lemon balm promotes **deeper sleep** without the heavy sedation of THC, making it a great replacement for **evening use**.\n\n### 5. **Passionflower (Passiflora incarnata)**\n   - **Anxiety Reduction and Relaxation**: Passionflower is effective for reducing **anxiety** and promoting **deep relaxation**, making it a suitable replacement for THC when relaxation or sleep support is needed.\n   - **Sleep Aid**: Passionflower works similarly to THC for promoting **calmness and deep sleep**, helping to replace the sleep-enhancing effects of THC-based products.\n\n### 6. **Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)**\n   - **Stress Relief and Calm Energy**: Ashwagandha is a powerful adaptogen that helps the body cope with **stress**. It can promote **calm energy** and reduce feelings of anxiety without sedation.\n   - **Mood Enhancement**: Ashwagandha can help improve **mood and emotional resilience**, making it a good long-term replacement for the mood-stabilizing effects of THC.\n\n### 7. **Valerian Root (Valeriana officinalis)**\n   - **Sedative and Sleep Aid**: Valerian root is a more direct replacement for THC\u2019s **sleep-inducing properties**. It\u2019s highly effective for promoting **deep, restful sleep**, but it can be sedating, so it should be reserved for **evening use**.\n   - **Anxiety Reduction**: Valerian can also help reduce **anxiety** during times of heightened stress, though its sedative properties make it less useful for daytime.\n\n### Proposed Herbal Tincture Combinations:\n\n#### **Daytime Tincture (Calming and Mood-Lifting)**\n- **Sage**: For cognitive clarity and stress relief.\n- **Kanna**: For mood enhancement and euphoria.\n- **Rosemary**: For mental clarity and relaxation.\n\nThis combination would offer **calm focus, improved mood**, and **mild relaxation**, making it a good substitute for daytime THC use.\n\n#### **Evening Tincture (Relaxation and Sleep Support)**\n- **Lemon Balm**: For calmness and sleep support.\n- **Passionflower**: For anxiety relief and deeper relaxation.\n- **Valerian Root**: To promote restful sleep.\n\nThis blend would provide **deep relaxation and sleep support**, helping to replace the sedative effects of THC without overwhelming drowsiness.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy combining herbs like **sage, kanna, rosemary, lemon balm**, and others, the patient can create a **herbal tincture** that mirrors the **euphoria, relaxation, and sleep-inducing** effects of THC. These herbal combinations offer **natural support for mood, anxiety**, and **sleep**, and could gradually replace cannabinoid-based products. Starting with small doses and observing the effects would help tailor the tincture to her specific needs, while maintaining the benefits she currently enjoys from THC."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

While the effects might not fully replicate the euphoria of THC, this tincture can still offer **calm, mild euphoria, relaxation**, and **creative stimulation**.\n\n### Supermarket-Friendly Herb Tincture Recipe\n\nHere are some easily sourced herbs that can still provide **relaxation**, **creativity**, and **mood enhancement**:\n\n1. **Sage (Salvia officinalis)** \u2013 Readily available and known for its **cognitive-enhancing** and **calming effects**. It can help with **focus, introspection**, and **mental clarity**.\n   \n2. **Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)** \u2013 Also easy to find and is great for improving **memory, creativity**, and **mental clarity**. It\u2019s mildly **energizing** but also helps reduce **stress**.\n\n3. **Basil (Ocimum basilicum)** \u2013 Known for its **mood-lifting** properties and mild **euphoria**. Basil promotes **relaxation** and **focus**.\n\n4. **Thyme (Thymus vulgaris)** \u2013 Provides **mental clarity** and **stress relief** while supporting **relaxation**. It can be calming and help with **mood stability**.\n\n5. **Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis)** \u2013 Although not always available at all supermarkets, **lemon balm** is becoming more common in grocery stores and provides **anxiety relief** and **calm energy**, as well as supporting **sleep**. If not available, you can substitute it with **mint**, which also offers **calming effects**.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **20 grams fresh sage**\n- **20 grams fresh rosemary**\n- **20 grams fresh basil**\n- **15 grams fresh thyme**\n- **15 grams fresh lemon balm (or mint if unavailable)**\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Prepare the Herbs**:\n   - Wash the fresh herbs and gently pat them dry.\n   - If desired, chop the herbs to increase the surface area for better extraction.\n   \n2. **Decarb the Herbs (Optional but Recommended for Enhanced Potency)**:\n   - Preheat your oven to **77-100\u00b0C (170-210\u00b0F)**.\n   - Spread the herbs on a baking sheet and bake them for about **20-30 minutes** at the lowest temperature, checking to ensure they don\u2019t burn. This can help activate the phytochemicals in the herbs, similar to decarbing cannabis.\n\n3. **Create the Tincture**:\n   - Place the decarbed herbs in a clean, sealable glass jar.\n   - Pour enough **high-proof alcohol** (like **vodka** or **grain alcohol**, at least 40-50% alcohol) over the herbs to completely submerge them. \n   - Seal the jar tightly and shake it well.\n\n4. **Infusion Period**:\n   - Store the jar in a **cool, dark place** for at least **2-4 weeks**. Shake the jar daily to help the alcohol extract the beneficial compounds from the herbs.\n   - For a stronger tincture, you can let it infuse for up to 6 weeks.\n\n5. **Strain the Tincture**:\n   - After the infusion period, strain the herbs from the alcohol using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth, collecting the liquid tincture in a clean jar or bottle.\n   - Store the tincture in a dark, sealed bottle for long-term use.\n\n### Dosage:\n- Start with **5-10 drops** in a **cup of tea** (instant lemon tea would work well) or another beverage like water or juice.\n- Gradually increase the dose depending on how you feel. Effects are subtle but can help with **mood enhancement, mental clarity, relaxation**, and **creative thinking**.\n\n### Expected Effects:\n- **Sage and rosemary** will help with **mental clarity and focus**, making this tincture great for **daytime use** when creativity or introspection is needed.\n- **Basil and thyme** provide **mood-lifting properties**, helping with **mild euphoria** and emotional balance.\n- **Lemon balm or mint** will add **calm and relaxation**, helping to reduce anxiety and promote a sense of well-being.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile this supermarket-friendly tincture may not replicate the **strong euphoria** of THC, it can offer **mood-lifting, relaxing, and creativity-enhancing** effects. Using fresh herbs like **sage, rosemary, basil, thyme,** and **lemon balm**, this tincture is affordable, easy to make, and provides a natural alternative to THC for managing mood and enhancing creative energy."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Early research suggests that **THCP** binds much more strongly to the body\u2019s **CB1 receptors**, which are responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabinoids. This means it could produce **euphoria, relaxation, and other effects** similar to THC, but at much **lower doses**.\n\n### Considerations for the Patient:\n\n1. **Potency**:\n   - **THCP** is estimated to be **up to 30 times more potent** than regular THC. Because of this, the patient would need to be cautious with dosing, starting very low to avoid overwhelming psychoactive effects.\n   - Since the patient enjoys **euphoric, creative, and relaxing effects** from THC products, **THCP** could potentially provide a **stronger version** of those desired effects but at much lower doses, making it **cost-effective** in the long run.\n\n2. **Euphoric and Relaxing Effects**:\n   - **THCP** could provide **strong euphoria**, **body relaxation**, and **mood elevation**, which align with the effects the patient enjoys from THC. These effects might be similar to the **high THC distillates and RSO oils** that make her feel **happy and relaxed**.\n   - If the patient is seeking **creative, introspective** states, THCP edibles could potentially provide that in a much more **concentrated and long-lasting form**.\n\n3. **Affordability**:\n   - Since **THCP** is more potent than THC, the patient might need **smaller doses** to achieve the same or stronger effects. This could make THCP products a **more affordable option** in the long term because a little goes a long way. Fewer doses are needed, reducing the overall cost compared to THC products.\n\n4. **Potential Risks**:\n   - **Higher potency** comes with the risk of **overconsumption**, especially if the patient isn\u2019t familiar with the effects of THCP. Starting with a very small dose would be essential to gauge tolerance.\n   - There is limited research on the long-term effects of THCP, so while it may be effective in the short term, the patient should be cautious and observe how it affects her mental and physical well-being over time.\n\n5. **Replacement for THC-Based Products**:\n   - If the patient is looking for a **more affordable** but **effective replacement** for **THC-based products**, **THCP edibles** could be a good option, especially if she enjoys the **creative, euphoric**, and **body-relaxing** effects. However, it\u2019s important to find a reputable source and start with **small doses** to avoid overwhelming effects, given its potency.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**THCP edibles** could be a good alternative for the patient due to their **potency**, potential for **euphoria**, and ability to induce **deep relaxation**\u2014all while using **smaller doses**. This makes THCP products a **cost-effective substitute** for THC, as long as the patient starts with **low doses** and monitors how it affects her.

This might enhance its effects on **digestion**, **calming**, and **muscle relaxation**.\n- **Stronger Flavor**: Heating mint can release more of its **aromatic oils**, resulting in a stronger mint flavor in the tincture.

Fresh mint still offers **digestive support** and **mild calming effects**, but in a gentler form.\n- **No Loss of Heat-Sensitive Compounds**: By using it fresh, you preserve more of mint\u2019s **natural volatile compounds** that might be lost during the decarbing process.

However, there are some considerations for each herb:\n\n### **Sage (Thujone)**:\n- **Thujone** has a boiling point of around **201\u00b0C (394\u00b0F)**, so the **77\u00b0C water bath** will not degrade it. However, extended heat exposure can cause a **gradual reduction** in potency, though it shouldn&#x27;t be a concern at 1 hour at this lower temperature.

However, some of the more **volatile oils** (like **camphor**) might evaporate or lose potency if exposed to heat for too long. \n- **1 hour** should still allow for sufficient extraction of the beneficial compounds without degrading too much of the more delicate essential oils. \n\n### Should the Water Bath be Shorter?\n- **45 minutes** could be an option if you&#x27;re concerned about any loss of the more **volatile compounds**, especially in rosemary.

Here are some reasons why a **shorter duration** might be suggested:\n\n### 1. **Preservation of Volatile Compounds**:\n   - **Essential oils** and **terpenes** found in many herbs (including cannabis, sage, and rosemary) are sensitive to prolonged heat exposure. A shorter **20-minute water bath** helps **preserve these volatile compounds** that contribute to the flavor, aroma, and medicinal properties of the tincture. For example, compounds like **terpenes** (in cannabis) and **camphor** (in rosemary) could evaporate or degrade with extended heating.\n   \n### 2. **Faster Extraction with High-Proof Alcohol**:\n   - **High-proof alcohol (96%)** is a very efficient solvent, especially when paired with even mild heat. It extracts **cannabinoids** (THC/CBD), **thujone**, and other active compounds relatively quickly. In 20 minutes, the alcohol can effectively extract most of the beneficial components without needing extended heating.\n   \n### 3. **Minimizing Compound Degradation**:\n   - While some compounds like **THC** and **thujone** are relatively heat-stable, other components can degrade if exposed to prolonged heat. **20 minutes** is often enough time to decarb and extract these compounds without risking degradation.\n   - A **longer extraction time** can sometimes lead to the breakdown of **flavonoids** and other phytochemicals, so a **shorter duration** preserves more of the plant\u2019s medicinal profile.\n\n### 4. **Quick Decarboxylation**:\n   - The **20-minute** time frame can also refer to **decarboxylating** cannabinoids or activating compounds in herbs like sage or rosemary. This time frame at **77\u00b0C** is often enough to convert **THCA to THC** or activate other herbal compounds without losing too much potency.\n\n### 5. **Consistency Across Recipes**:\n   - Many Green Dragon recipes are designed for people looking for a quick, efficient tincture-making process. A **20-minute water bath** strikes a balance between quick extraction and maximizing potency, making it practical for most users without risking loss of important compounds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **20-minute water bath** is a popular method because it:\n- **Preserves volatile compounds** like terpenes and essential oils.\n- Is sufficient for **efficient extraction** with high-proof alcohol.\n- Minimizes **heat-induced degradation** of delicate phytochemicals.\n- Is practical for most home tincture makers seeking a balance between **potency and convenience**.\n\nIf you&#x27;re aiming for a quicker process and want to ensure minimal loss of aromatic or delicate compounds, sticking with the **20-minute timeframe** would still provide a potent tincture, while preserving more of the herbal essence."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, it could still contribute to the overall **therapeutic effects** of the tincture. Here\u2019s what **dried basil** might bring:\n\n### Benefits of Adding Dried Basil:\n1. **Mild Mood Enhancement**:\n   - Basil has **mild mood-enhancing** properties, mainly due to its content of **linalool** and **eugenol**, which are known to help reduce **stress** and promote a sense of **calm**. While not as strong as cannabis or sage, it could offer a gentle **mood boost** when added to the tincture.\n   \n2. **Digestive Support**:\n   - Basil is also known for its ability to **support digestion**. It has mild **carminative** (gas-relieving) properties, which could enhance the tincture&#x27;s effects on the digestive system, especially if consumed after meals.\n\n3. **Antioxidant Properties**:\n   - Dried basil contains **antioxidants**, which can help protect cells from oxidative stress. While it\u2019s not as potent as rosemary or sage in this regard, adding it may provide additional **anti-inflammatory** and **antioxidant support**.\n\n4. **Subtle Flavor Addition**:\n   - Basil will bring a mild **herbal flavor** to the tincture, which could complement the other herbs, especially if you enjoy a more complex flavor profile. However, if the other herbs are strong, basil\u2019s flavor might get lost.\n\n### Downsides to Adding Dried Basil:\n- **Lower Potency**: Compared to the other herbs you\u2019re using (sage, rosemary, cannabis), basil\u2019s effects are much **milder**. While it won\u2019t detract from the tincture, it might not add much noticeable benefit.\n- **Potential for Muddling Effects**: With so many herbs involved, the therapeutic effects of basil might be overshadowed, and it could add **complexity** to the tincture without significant added benefits.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Dried basil** could add some **mood-enhancing, digestive support**, and **antioxidant effects**, but it may not have a major impact compared to the more potent herbs you\u2019re already using. If you enjoy basil&#x27;s subtle effects and flavor, you can add it, but if you&#x27;re looking for more bang for your buck, the **sage, rosemary, cannabis**, and **mint** will likely provide the more impactful benefits."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

These compounds are aromatic and can have an impact on the brain when inhaled, stimulating feelings of euphoria or alertness.\n\n### What Could Be Causing the Euphoric Effect?\n1. **Thujone**: \n   - **Thujone** is a compound found in sage that interacts with **GABA receptors** in the brain, similar to how some psychoactive substances work. While thujone is not highly psychoactive in small amounts, it can still promote a sense of **euphoria, mental stimulation**, or even mild **altered states** when inhaled.\n   \n2. **Aromatic Terpenes**:\n   - **Camphor** and **1,8-cineole** (also found in eucalyptus) are two key terpenes in sage that are known to enhance **alertness** and **mood**. Inhaling these terpenes can lead to a mild **mood boost** and heightened **sensory awareness**, which could explain why she feels \u201calmost high\u201d from the aroma of fresh-cut sage.\n\n### Will the Tincture Have a Profound Effect?\nGiven her sensitivity to the **aromatic compounds in sage**, it\u2019s very likely that a tincture made from sage\u2014particularly one that\u2019s **decarbed** and has a higher concentration of these active compounds\u2014could have a **profound effect** on her. The tincture would deliver these **volatile compounds** not just through inhalation, but also through absorption, which may result in more **intense effects** such as:\n- **Mental clarity** and **focus**.\n- Stronger **euphoria** and **mood elevation**.\n- Potential for **body relaxation** and heightened **sensory awareness**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe patient\u2019s sensitivity to the **aromatics in sage** suggests that the **tincture** will likely have a **significant impact** on her. The effects she feels from sniffing the fresh sage will likely be **amplified** in a tincture, especially with proper decarboxylation and extraction of the active compounds like **thujone** and **terpenes**."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are some considerations:\n\n### Potential Pitfalls:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Potency**:\n   - Without precise measurements, the potency of your tincture may vary, leading to **inconsistent effects**. One batch might be much stronger or weaker than another, making it difficult to achieve predictable results, especially with herbs like cannabis, sage, or rosemary where **concentration of active compounds** matters.\n\n2. **Over- or Under-extraction**:\n   - If you&#x27;re not accurately measuring the amount of **herbs** versus **alcohol**, you could risk under-extracting the beneficial compounds, leaving you with a **weaker tincture**. Conversely, you might over-extract, leading to **excessive concentration** that could result in unexpected or overly strong effects.\n\n3. **Wasting Ingredients**:\n   - Using too much of a herb (e.g., cannabis, psilocybin, sage) could lead to **wasted ingredients**, especially when those herbs are costly or in limited supply. Precise measurements help make sure you&#x27;re getting the most out of your materials.\n\n4. **Difficulty Reproducing Success**:\n   - If a particular tincture works perfectly, it will be hard to **reproduce** it exactly if you haven\u2019t tracked your measurements. Without a record of quantities, ratios, or infusion times, creating the same effect again becomes more guesswork.\n\n5. **Safety Concerns**:\n   - With powerful herbs like **cannabis** (THC), **psilocybin**, or even sage (containing **thujone**), imprecise dosing could lead to **overconsumption**. This can result in **overwhelming psychoactive effects** or adverse reactions such as anxiety, dizziness, or nausea.\n\n### Benefits of Measuring with Precision:\n- **Control over effects**: You can fine-tune the strength of your tincture.\n- **Consistency**: Each batch will have predictable effects, so you know how much to take for the desired outcome.\n- **Efficiency**: You avoid overusing herbs and alcohol, saving costs and making the process more sustainable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMeasuring &quot;with your heart&quot; is creative and spontaneous, but it can lead to **inconsistencies in potency**, **waste**, and **difficulty reproducing successful results**.

While sage has beneficial properties when used appropriately, it&#x27;s important to exercise caution with such concentrated preparations.

Adding them to the tincture might enhance its ability to aid in **digestive health**, making it soothing for the stomach.\n\n2. **Mild Relaxation**:\n   - Bay leaves contain **linalool**, a compound that is also present in herbs like basil. **Linalool** is known for its mild **calming effects**, which could complement the **relaxation** you aim to achieve with the tincture. However, the effect will be mild.\n\n3. **Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Properties**:\n   - Bay leaves have **antioxidant** and **anti-inflammatory** properties, thanks to compounds like **eugenol** and **quercetin**. Adding them could contribute to the overall **anti-inflammatory** benefits of the tincture, supporting general well-being.\n\n4. **Flavor**:\n   - Bay leaves will add a slightly **herbal, earthy flavor** to the tincture, which might complement the other herbs. However, the flavor could become quite strong, so be cautious about the quantity if you&#x27;re concerned about taste.\n\n### **Potential Downsides:**\n- **Low Potency Compared to Other Herbs**: Bay leaves are much more **subtle** in their effects compared to sage or cannabis, so while they can contribute to digestion and mild relaxation, they won&#x27;t have a profound impact on the tincture&#x27;s overall effects.\n- **Flavor Overpowering**: If too many bay leaves are used, their strong flavor could dominate the tincture, making it **bitter** or **unpalatable**.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nAdding **dried bay leaves** to the tincture could provide **digestive support**, **mild relaxation**, and **anti-inflammatory** benefits. However, they are not particularly potent, so their effects will be subtle. If you&#x27;re primarily interested in the **digestive benefits** or want to add **flavor complexity**, bay leaves could be a good addition.

Adding fresh ginger or ginger powder could enhance the tincture&#x27;s **digestive support** properties, particularly if consumed after meals.\n- **Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant**: Ginger contains compounds like **gingerol**, which has both **anti-inflammatory** and **antioxidant** properties, supporting joint health and reducing oxidative stress.\n- **Mild Energizing Effect**: Ginger has a **warming, stimulating** effect on the body, which could complement the relaxing effects of other herbs like sage by adding a gentle sense of **invigoration**.\n\n### **Comparison and Effectiveness**:\n- **Curcuma (Turmeric)**: Offers more **anti-inflammatory** benefits but has limited bioavailability unless combined with **black pepper** or fats.\n- **Ginger (Fresh or Powdered)**: Provides **digestive support**, mild **energy**, and **anti-inflammatory** benefits with better absorption than turmeric, especially when used fresh.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nBoth **curcuma (turmeric)** and **ginger** can add **anti-inflammatory**, **digestive**, and **antioxidant** properties to your tincture. However, their effects will be **milder** compared to more potent ingredients like cannabis, sage, and rosemary. If you&#x27;re aiming for added **digestive support** or want to enhance the tincture&#x27;s **anti-inflammatory benefits**, ginger might be the more **practical choice** due to its **better absorption** and broader benefits for digestion and general well-being. Turmeric can also be beneficial, but adding **black pepper** would be important for better **curcumin absorption**."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Given the patient&#x27;s interest in managing **appetite**, **euphoria**, and **mental stimulation**, **oral THCV** might be particularly relevant to their situation.\n\n### **Effects of Oral THCV**:\n\n1. **Appetite Suppression**:\n   - Unlike THC, **THCV** has been shown to act as an **appetite suppressant** at lower doses. This could be useful for the patient, especially if they are trying to balance the **appetite-stimulating effects** they experienced with the sage/rosemary tincture. THCV could potentially **reduce cravings** and help control hunger.\n   - For a patient who finds **coffee** to suppress appetite, THCV could provide a similar effect, making it a good option if they are looking to manage hunger while still benefiting from cannabinoids.\n\n2. **Stimulant and Mental Clarity**:\n   - THCV is often described as a **stimulating** cannabinoid, promoting **mental clarity**, **focus**, and **alertness** without the sedative effects sometimes associated with THC. This could make THCV a good fit for someone who enjoys the **mentally stimulating** effects of sage and rosemary but wants to avoid feeling too relaxed or hungry.\n   - The patient may find that oral THCV provides a **creative, introspective boost** similar to what they enjoy from cannabis, but with less of the euphoric &quot;high&quot; typically associated with THC or THCP.\n\n3. **Lower Psychoactivity**:\n   - At lower doses, **THCV is less psychoactive** than THC, meaning the patient could still experience **cognitive stimulation** and **mood elevation** without strong psychoactive effects. However, at higher doses, THCV can produce **euphoric** effects similar to THC.\n\n4. **Potential Benefits for Metabolism**:\n   - Some studies suggest that THCV could help regulate **blood sugar** levels and support **metabolic health**, making it potentially beneficial for someone managing **weight** or **appetite-related concerns**.\n\n### **In the Context of Previous Discussions**:\n- The patient is looking for ways to manage **appetite** and enjoys **mental stimulation**. Given THCV\u2019s **appetite-suppressing** effects and ability to enhance **focus**, it could be an ideal cannabinoid to experiment with.\n- **THCV in oral form** (e.g., tinctures, edibles) would be easy to integrate into the patient\u2019s routine, possibly alongside the **sage/rosemary tincture** or **coffee**, to help manage cravings while providing **clarity** and **mood enhancement** without overwhelming psychoactivity.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\n**Oral THCV** could be a beneficial addition for the patient, particularly if they are seeking to suppress appetite, maintain mental clarity, and enhance focus. It offers a **different profile** from THC and THCP, making it worth exploring if the patient wants to **balance appetite regulation** with **cognitive stimulation** and **mood enhancement**."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The probe is also examining Prince\u2019s connections with foreign intelligence and military entities, including his reported support for rogue military commander Khalifa Haftar.\n\nAccording to the \u201cWashington Babylon\u201d newspaper, the investigation focuses on three main areas. Firstly, Prince is suspected of facilitating the illegal transfer of weapons to Haftar, a violation of the international arms embargo on Libya. Prince is alleged to have played a significant role in assisting Haftar during his 2019 attempt to overthrow Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government.\n\nThe investigation also scrutinizes whether Prince\u2019s laundered money is linked to his support for Haftar.

Fortunately, I obtained details about a large slice of the chat group\u2019s discussions over the past six months. Here\u2019s some of what they discussed.\n\nSolving the Middle East Crisis: Nukes, Napalm, and Other \u201cExtreme Measures\u201d\n\nOff Leash was launched less than two months after Israel commenced its assault on Gaza following Hamas\u2019s deadly October 7 attack on Israel, and that topic has been one of the group chat\u2019s main concerns since it was established by Prince on December 2. Five days later, Omer Laviv, an executive with the Mer Group, a private security company with many former Israeli intelligence officials in its senior ranks, posted \u301016\u2020a story\u2020www.thetimes.co.uk\u3011 to the group that ran two days earlier in The Times of London and reported Prince had been seeking to sell the Israel Defense Forces equipment for a plan he\u2019d devised to flood Hamas tunnels with seawater.\n\n\u201cI was involved,\u201d remarked Moti Kahana, the Israeli American businessman who runs GDC, the firm where Off Leash member Stuart Seldowitz previously worked. Kahana pointedly added that at least one part of The Times\u2019 story was false\u2014for example, Prince had offered to donate the equipment, not sell it, he said.\n\n\u201cWhy do you expect accuracy from journalists?\u201d retorted Laviv, who during the Trump administration retained 27 U.S. lobbyists and consultants to run a $9.5 million lobbying campaign on behalf of President Joseph Kabila, the corrupt, brutal leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who used surveillance equipment supplied by the Mer Group to monitor his regime\u2019s opponents. Among those Laviv involved were Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, fixer, and dirt-digger, and Robert Stryk, whose clients have included Saudi Arabia and El Salvador\u2019s state intelligence agency under crypto-fascist President Nayib Bukele.\n\nYudelson, who also reportedly partnered with Prince in an attempt to buy weapons for resale from Belarus dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko (\u301017\u2020whom the two men praised for bringing \u201cpeace, stability, and prosperity to your country\u2020matthewcole.substack.com\u3011\u201d), predicted the tunnel-flooding proposal would be shot down by the \u201cIsraeli left,\u201d a force he labeled the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest enemy,\u201d ahead of Hamas and Iran, over concerns about the environmental impact in Gaza. \u201cWho gives a shit about that,\u201d Yudelson posted to the group. \u201cIf it was up to me \u2026 I would flood them with Napalm! I would burn all those bastards, and have everything above ground, everything left of Gaza, collapse into this fiery hell pit and burn!\u201d\n\nEven that was deemed to be insufficiently hawkish for some Off Leash participants. In a lengthy tirade on February 14, Tzvi Lev, who formerly worked in Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said it was rare to see a people as \u201ctwisted\u201d as Palestinians, whose culture \u201cworships death and bloodshed.\u201d The only solution, he wrote, was to \u201ccompletely uproot the radical Islamic Palestinian nationalism,\u201d which was possible to do based on the historical precedent of Japan, which \u201cwent from being nuked twice to one of the world\u2019s strongest economies within two decades.\u201d Dropping nuclear weapons on what\u2019s left of densely populated Gaza, which is roughly the size of Detroit, would be a war crime and kill huge numbers of civilians.\n\nYoav Goldhorn, \u301018\u2020the former Israeli intelligence officer\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, also cited \u201cfucking nukes in Japan\u201d as an appropriate remedy to the Palestinian problem. Sadly, wrote Goldhorn, whose LinkedIn profile says he has \u201ca passion for strategic planning,\u201d there was no one in the Israeli government with \u201cthe balls nor vision to go all those extra miles.\u201d\n\nIran: Off Leash\u2019s Public Enemy No. 1 \n\nIt was hard to keep track of all the wars, invasions, covert operations, coups, and assassinations Off Leash members favored. One region ripe for a bit of good old-fashioned Western intervention was Africa, which was described as a \u201cpot about to boil over\u201d by \u301019\u2020Emma Priestley\u2020otp.investis.com\u3011, who posts as \u201cCustomer\u201d in the group chat and is the \u301019\u2020CEO of GoldStone Resources Limited\u2020otp.investis.com\u3011 in Jersey, the English Channel island that is one of the world\u2019s most popular offshore secrecy havens.

Fortunately, I obtained details about a large slice of the chat group\u2019s discussions over the past six months. Here\u2019s some of what they discussed.\n\nSolving the Middle East Crisis: Nukes, Napalm, and Other \u201cExtreme Measures\u201d\n\nOff Leash was launched less than two months after Israel commenced its assault on Gaza following Hamas\u2019s deadly October 7 attack on Israel, and that topic has been one of the group chat\u2019s main concerns since it was established by Prince on December 2. Five days later, Omer Laviv, an executive with the Mer Group, a private security company with many former Israeli intelligence officials in its senior ranks, posted \u301016\u2020a story\u2020www.thetimes.co.uk\u3011 to the group that ran two days earlier in The Times of London and reported Prince had been seeking to sell the Israel Defense Forces equipment for a plan he\u2019d devised to flood Hamas tunnels with seawater.\n\n\u201cI was involved,\u201d remarked Moti Kahana, the Israeli American businessman who runs GDC, the firm where Off Leash member Stuart Seldowitz previously worked. Kahana pointedly added that at least one part of The Times\u2019 story was false\u2014for example, Prince had offered to donate the equipment, not sell it, he said.\n\n\u201cWhy do you expect accuracy from journalists?\u201d retorted Laviv, who during the Trump administration retained 27 U.S. lobbyists and consultants to run a $9.5 million lobbying campaign on behalf of President Joseph Kabila, the corrupt, brutal leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who used surveillance equipment supplied by the Mer Group to monitor his regime\u2019s opponents. Among those Laviv involved were Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, fixer, and dirt-digger, and Robert Stryk, whose clients have included Saudi Arabia and El Salvador\u2019s state intelligence agency under crypto-fascist President Nayib Bukele.\n\nYudelson, who also reportedly partnered with Prince in an attempt to buy weapons for resale from Belarus dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko (\u301017\u2020whom the two men praised for bringing \u201cpeace, stability, and prosperity to your country\u2020matthewcole.substack.com\u3011\u201d), predicted the tunnel-flooding proposal would be shot down by the \u201cIsraeli left,\u201d a force he labeled the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest enemy,\u201d ahead of Hamas and Iran, over concerns about the environmental impact in Gaza. \u201cWho gives a shit about that,\u201d Yudelson posted to the group. \u201cIf it was up to me \u2026 I would flood them with Napalm! I would burn all those bastards, and have everything above ground, everything left of Gaza, collapse into this fiery hell pit and burn!\u201d\n\nEven that was deemed to be insufficiently hawkish for some Off Leash participants. In a lengthy tirade on February 14, Tzvi Lev, who formerly worked in Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said it was rare to see a people as \u201ctwisted\u201d as Palestinians, whose culture \u201cworships death and bloodshed.\u201d The only solution, he wrote, was to \u201ccompletely uproot the radical Islamic Palestinian nationalism,\u201d which was possible to do based on the historical precedent of Japan, which \u201cwent from being nuked twice to one of the world\u2019s strongest economies within two decades.\u201d Dropping nuclear weapons on what\u2019s left of densely populated Gaza, which is roughly the size of Detroit, would be a war crime and kill huge numbers of civilians.\n\nYoav Goldhorn, \u301018\u2020the former Israeli intelligence officer\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, also cited \u201cfucking nukes in Japan\u201d as an appropriate remedy to the Palestinian problem. Sadly, wrote Goldhorn, whose LinkedIn profile says he has \u201ca passion for strategic planning,\u201d there was no one in the Israeli government with \u201cthe balls nor vision to go all those extra miles.\u201d\n\nIran: Off Leash\u2019s Public Enemy No. 1 \n\nIt was hard to keep track of all the wars, invasions, covert operations, coups, and assassinations Off Leash members favored. One region ripe for a bit of good old-fashioned Western intervention was Africa, which was described as a \u201cpot about to boil over\u201d by \u301019\u2020Emma Priestley\u2020otp.investis.com\u3011, who posts as \u201cCustomer\u201d in the group chat and is the \u301019\u2020CEO of GoldStone Resources Limited\u2020otp.investis.com\u3011 in Jersey, the English Channel island that is one of the world\u2019s most popular offshore secrecy havens. China would have to be taken down a peg as well, particularly as Biden wasn\u2019t going to stop the country \u201cfrom doing a damn thing,\u201d and indeed he would pave the way for it to do \u201cwhatever it is they want to accomplish,\u201d posted Randy Couture, the former UFC heavyweight champion and actor who had the role of arsonist and killer Jason Duclair in the TV series Hawaii Five-0 and starred in the 2011 movie Setup with 50 Cent and Bruce Willis.\n\nBut the No. 1 target on Off Leash\u2019s hit list, by orders of magnitude, was Iran. \u201cFollow the source of evil,\u201d wrote Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke, who served as interior secretary under Trump. \u201cHamas.

The probe is also examining Prince\u2019s connections with foreign intelligence and military entities, including his reported support for rogue military commander Khalifa Haftar.\n\nAccording to the \u201cWashington Babylon\u201d newspaper, the investigation focuses on three main areas. Firstly, Prince is suspected of facilitating the illegal transfer of weapons to Haftar, a violation of the international arms embargo on Libya. Prince is alleged to have played a significant role in assisting Haftar during his 2019 attempt to overthrow Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government.\n\nThe investigation also scrutinizes whether Prince\u2019s laundered money is linked to his support for Haftar. The United Nations has estimated the cost of Prince\u2019s assistance to Haftar at $80 million, with much of the funding reportedly originating from the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAdditionally, the FBI is exploring the broader relationship between Prince and Haftar, particularly Prince\u2019s involvement in providing military support and operational planning for Haftar\u2019s forces.\n\nTags: \u301026\u2020Khalifa Haftar\u3011 \u301027\u2020blackwater\u3011 \u301028\u2020mercenaries\u3011 \n\n### Read Also:\n\n\u301029\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301029\u2020Amnesty International urges Haftar to unveil fate of Mahdi Al-Barghathi \u3011\n\nOctober 03, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301030\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301030\u2020Canada accuses Chinese officials of trying to smuggle drones to Haftar\u3011\n\nSeptember 28, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301031\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301031\u2020Commander of US AFRICOM reviews with Haftar strengthening US-Libyan partnership\u3011\n\nAugust 28, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301032\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301032\u2020Haftar rejects change of CBL governor in meeting with UN envoy\u3011\n\nAugust 27, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301033\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301033\u2020Haftar&#x27;s son meets with Turkish Foreign Minister in Ankara\u3011\n\nJuly 25, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301034\u2020Italy blocks shipment of Chinese drones bound for Haftar\u3011\n\nJuly 02, 2024 0 comment\n\n### Must read\n\n#### \u301035\u2020Libyan Football Federation apologizes to fans for disruption caused by Nigerian Football Federation\u3011\n\nOctober 15, 2024 \u301035\u2020 0\u3011 0 Shares\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Libyan Football Federation condemned the Nigerian Football Federation&#x27;s actions in refusing to play the return match in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers, stressi\n\n#### \u301036\u2020Sudanese army seizes weapons coming from Benghazi to back up Hemedti&#x27;s RSF \u3011\n\nOctober 13, 2024 \u301036\u2020 0\u3011 0 Shares\n\n\u301036\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Sudanese newspaper &quot;Al-Mandara News&quot; reported that the Sudanese army seized arms shipments belonging to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) under the command of Hemedti, s\n\n#### \u301037\u2020Dbeibah: We&#x27;ve started resolving years-long obstacles in Libya&#x27;s political crisis\u3011\n\nOctober 12, 2024 \u301037\u2020 0\u3011 0 Shares\n\n\u301037\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u200eThe Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah said that the Libyan political scene &quot;is entering a new phase, after his government has begun taking decisive steps to reso\n\n### News In Brief\n\n#### \u301038\u2020Koury reviews Libyan developments with UAE Minister of State in Abu Dhabi\u3011\n\nOctober 15, 2024\n\n\u301038\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Acting Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), Stephanie Koury, has held a meeting in\n\n#### \u301039\u2020Al-Baour discusses with Undersecretary of British Foreign Office bilateral cooperation \u3011\n\nOctober 15, 2024\n\n\u301039\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Government of National Unity (GNU), Taher Al-Baour, has discussed with the Undersecretary of the British Foreign Office, Phi\n\n#### \u301040\u2020New UN Humanitarian Coordinator meets with Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs\u3011\n\nOctober 15, 2024\n\n\u301040\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Humanitarian Coordinator in Libya, Aeneas Chapinga Chuma, has met with the Acting Min\n\n\u301041\u2020MORE\u3011 \n\n### Main Menu\n\n  * \u30104\u2020Home\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020About Us\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Monthly Archive\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Exchange Rates\u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020Advertise With Us\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020Terms &amp; Conditions\u3011\n\n### Categories\n\n  * \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020Economy\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020Sports\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Opinions\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020Variety\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Health\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Education\u3011\n\n### Multimedi", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 6, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1028, "end_ix": 1038, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Off Leash: Inside the Secret, Global, Far-Right Group Chat   | The New Republic", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/182008/erik-prince-secret-global-group-chat-off-leash", "text": "\nOff Leash was still active as of Wednesday, though I expect it won\u2019t be, at least in its current form, for much longer, given that the conversation Wednesday included much discussion about their security being breached, which became evident after I reached out to participants for comment.

Five days later, Omer Laviv, an executive with the Mer Group, a private security company with many former Israeli intelligence officials in its senior ranks, posted \u301016\u2020a story\u2020www.thetimes.co.uk\u3011 to the group that ran two days earlier in The Times of London and reported Prince had been seeking to sell the Israel Defense Forces equipment for a plan he\u2019d devised to flood Hamas tunnels with seawater.\n\n\u201cI was involved,\u201d remarked Moti Kahana, the Israeli American businessman who runs GDC, the firm where Off Leash member Stuart Seldowitz previously worked. Kahana pointedly added that at least one part of The Times\u2019 story was false\u2014for example, Prince had offered to donate the equipment, not sell it, he said.\n\n\u201cWhy do you expect accuracy from journalists?\u201d retorted Laviv, who during the Trump administration retained 27 U.S. lobbyists and consultants to run a $9.5 million lobbying campaign on behalf of President Joseph Kabila, the corrupt, brutal leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who used surveillance equipment supplied by the Mer Group to monitor his regime\u2019s opponents. Among those Laviv involved were Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, fixer, and dirt-digger, and Robert Stryk, whose clients have included Saudi Arabia and El Salvador\u2019s state intelligence agency under crypto-fascist President Nayib Bukele.\n\nYudelson, who also reportedly partnered with Prince in an attempt to buy weapons for resale from Belarus dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko (\u301017\u2020whom the two men praised for bringing \u201cpeace, stability, and prosperity to your country\u2020matthewcole.substack.com\u3011\u201d), predicted the tunnel-flooding proposal would be shot down by the \u201cIsraeli left,\u201d a force he labeled the country\u2019s \u201cbiggest enemy,\u201d ahead of Hamas and Iran, over concerns about the environmental impact in Gaza. \u201cWho gives a shit about that,\u201d Yudelson posted to the group. \u201cIf it was up to me \u2026 I would flood them with Napalm! I would burn all those bastards, and have everything above ground, everything left of Gaza, collapse into this fiery hell pit and burn!\u201d\n\nEven that was deemed to be insufficiently hawkish for some Off Leash participants. In a lengthy tirade on February 14, Tzvi Lev, who formerly worked in Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said it was rare to see a people as \u201ctwisted\u201d as Palestinians, whose culture \u201cworships death and bloodshed.\u201d The only solution, he wrote, was to \u201ccompletely uproot the radical Islamic Palestinian nationalism,\u201d which was possible to do based on the historical precedent of Japan, which \u201cwent from being nuked twice to one of the world\u2019s strongest economies within two decades.\u201d Dropping nuclear weapons on what\u2019s left of densely populated Gaza, which is roughly the size of Detroit, would be a war crime and kill huge numbers of civilians.\n\nYoav Goldhorn, \u301018\u2020the former Israeli intelligence officer\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, also cited \u201cfucking nukes in Japan\u201d as an appropriate remedy to the Palestinian problem. Sadly, wrote Goldhorn, whose LinkedIn profile says he has \u201ca passion for strategic planning,\u201d there was no one in the Israeli government with \u201cthe balls nor vision to go all those extra miles.\u201d\n\nIran: Off Leash\u2019s Public Enemy No. 1 \n\nIt was hard to keep track of all the wars, invasions, covert operations, coups, and assassinations Off Leash members favored. One region ripe for a bit of good old-fashioned Western intervention was Africa, which was described as a \u201cpot about to boil over\u201d by \u301019\u2020Emma Priestley\u2020otp.investis.com\u3011, who posts as \u201cCustomer\u201d in the group chat and is the \u301019\u2020CEO of GoldStone Resources Limited\u2020otp.investis.com\u3011 in Jersey, the English Channel island that is one of the world\u2019s most popular offshore secrecy havens. China would have to be taken down a peg as well, particularly as Biden wasn\u2019t going to stop the country \u201cfrom doing a damn thing,\u201d and indeed he would pave the way for it to do \u201cwhatever it is they want to accomplish,\u201d posted Randy Couture, the former UFC heavyweight champion and actor who had the role of arsonist and killer Jason Duclair in the TV series Hawaii Five-0 and starred in the 2011 movie Setup with 50 Cent and Bruce Willis.\n\nBut the No. 1 target on Off Leash\u2019s hit list, by orders of magnitude, was Iran. \u201cFollow the source of evil,\u201d wrote Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke, who served as interior secretary under Trump. \u201cHamas. Hezbollah. Houthis. Iran is the center of gravity.\u201d\n\n\u201cZinke is right,\u201d agreed Tennessee Congressman Mark Green of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 7, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1038, "end_ix": 1048, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Erik Prince says China likely to attack Taiwan in 2024\n | Taiwan News | Dec. 31, 2023 16:58", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/5069317", "text": "\n\u301021\u2020Opinion\u3011\n\n\u301022\u2020World\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020Sponsored\u3011\n\n[Image 4: search]\n\nMORE\n\n[Image 5: search]\n\n\u30102\u2020Politics\u3011[Image 6: arrow-down]\n\n\u30103\u2020All\u3011\u30104\u2020Foreign Affairs\u3011\u30105\u2020Cross-strait\u3011\n\n\u30106\u2020Business\u3011[Image 7: arrow-down]\n\n\u30107\u2020All\u3011\u30108\u2020Investing\u3011\n\n\u30109\u2020Tech\u3011\n\n\u301010\u2020Society\u3011\n\n\u301011\u2020Health\u3011\n\n\u301012\u2020Culture\u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Environment\u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Lifestyle\u3011[Image 8: arrow-down]\n\n\u301015\u2020All\u3011\u301016\u2020Cuisine\u3011\u301017\u2020Travel\u3011\u301018\u2020Entertainment\u3011\u301019\u2020Variety\u3011\u301020\u2020Sports\u3011\n\n\u301021\u2020Opinion\u3011\n\n\u301022\u2020World\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020Sponsored\u3011\n\n[Image 9: FB][Image 10: X][Image 11: Youtube][Image 12: IG]\n\nLoading...\n\n\u301024\u2020About Us\u2020taiwannews.com.tw\u3011\u301025\u2020Contact Us\u3011\u301026\u2020Directory of Taiwan\u2020directory.taiwannews.com.tw\u3011\n\n[Image 13: FB][Image 14: X][Image 15: Youtube][Image 16: IG]\n\n\u301024\u2020About Us\u2020taiwannews.com.tw\u3011\u301025\u2020Contact Us\u3011\u301026\u2020Directory of Taiwan\u2020directory.taiwannews.com.tw\u3011\n\n[Image 17: FB][Image 18: X][Image 19: Youtube][Image 20: IG]\n\nTaiwan News \u00a9 2024 All Rights Reserved.\n\n\u30101\u2020Home\u3011\n\n/\n\n\u301022\u2020World\u3011\n\n# Erik Prince says China likely to attack Taiwan in 2024 \n\nXi Jinping must feel &#x27;door is wide open&#x27; amid declining US credibility under Biden administration, says former Blackwater chair \n\nDec. 31, 2023 16:58\n\n[Image 21: Erik Prince in New York City, November 2019. (Reuters photo) ]\n\nErik Prince in New York City, November 2019. (Reuters photo) \n\n38154 \n\nTAIPEI (Taiwan News) \u2014 In a video interview on the U.K.\u2019s GB News filmed on Thursday (Dec. 28), Erik Prince, a military contractor known for founding the Blackwater organization, said he expects China to target Taiwan militarily in the spring of 2024.\n\nPrince, a military strategist and former U.S. Navy Seal, was being \u301027\u2020interviewed\u2020www.gbnews.com\u3011 by Jacob Rees-Mogg about U.S. foreign policy setbacks under the Biden administration and the pressures faced by the U.S. military around the world. Prince said that amid declining U.S. credibility abroad, Chinese leader Xi Jinping (\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73) may try to \u201cbluster his way\u201d into a takeover of Taiwan, saying that \u201cit must feel like the door is wide open for them to do whatever it is they want to do.\u201d\n\nPrince\u2019s comments came one day after Xi Jinping, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, resolutely vowed to stop anyone from \u201cmaking Taiwan secede from China,\u201d calling \u301028\u2020unification\u3011 an \u201cinevitable trend.\u201d\n\nIn Prince\u2019s remarks, he criticized the U.S. \u201cinability to finish properly in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d which he credits for the increase of military threats across the world that have taken shape under the Biden administration. In addition to ongoing conflicts involving Ukraine and Israel, Prince also mentioned escalating conflicts in the wider Middle East, which now include attacks by Houthi rebels targeting shipping vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nSpeaking about a timeline for a potential attack by China on Taiwan, Prince said May or June 2024 is a likely window for Beijing to begin cross-strait naval operations. &quot;If they are going to take Taiwan by force, I would predict that they are going to do something this spring,&quot; Prince said, as reported by \u301029\u2020GB News\u2020www.gbnews.com\u3011.\n\nThe day after Prince made his prediction on GB News, China announced a shakeup in its military command. With only two weeks before Taiwan&#x27;s elections, Beijing appointed PLAN \u301030\u2020Admiral Dong Jun\u3011 as its newest Minister of National Defense.\n\nAfter leaving Blackwater and selling the company in 2010, Erik Prince\u2019s connections to CIA training programs were revealed in 2013. Around 2014, Prince became the chairman of a private security and logistics firm called the Frontier Services Group, a Chinese-owned company based in Hong Kong and involved in private security contract work in Africa.\n\nPrince stepped down as chairman of the Frontier Services Group in April 2021 but is still the head of a similar organization called the Frontier Resource Group, which has almost no online footprint as of publication.\n\n\u301031\u2020# Chinese invasion of Taiwan\u3011\u301032\u2020# Biden Administration\u3011\u301033\u2020# Erik Prince\u3011\u301034\u2020# Xi Jinping\u3011\n\n# Related Articles\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020Ex-Australia PM calls for effective deterrent against China\u2019s threats to annex Taiwan Oct. 22, 2024 14:56\u3011\u301036\u2020Harris says Taiwan &#x27;has right to defend itself&#x27; Oct. 17, 2024 10:41\u3011\u301037\u2020Trump claims China will not invade Taiwan if he is elected Oct. 16, 2024 16:43\u3011\u301038\u2020Former AIT chair says Article 8 of China\u2019s Anti-Secession Law is time bomb Oct. 16, 2024 13:43\u3011\u301039\u2020Poll shows 36% of Americans support sending troops to defend Taiwan Oct. 9, 2024 16:26\u3011\u301040\u2020Harris backs &#x27;Taiwan&#x27;s ability to defend itself&#x27; Oct. 8, 2024 14:27\u3011\n\n# MOST READ\n\n* * *\n\n\u301041\u2020Harvard punishes Taiwanese American student for disrupting Chinese ambassador\u3011\u301042\u2020Tropical Storm Trami forecast to steer south of Taiwan\u3011\u301043\u2020Tropi", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 8, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}], "content_references": [{"matched_text": "\u30106\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1018, "end_idx": 1028, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "FBI investigates Blackwater&#x27;s Erik Prince over alleged support for Haftar | The Libya Observer", "url": "https://libyaobserver.ly/news/fbi-investigates-blackwaters-erik-prince-over-alleged-support-haftar", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "  * \u301019\u2020Education\u3011 \n  * Multimedia\n\n    * \u301020\u2020Images\u3011 \n    * \u301021\u2020Videos\u3011 \n\n  * \u301022\u2020Print edition\u3011 \n\n  * Menu\n\nnewsbeat Drupal\n\nJust another Drupal site\n\n  * Search\n\nSearch\n\nCategory: \u30105\u2020News\u3011 \n\n# FBI investigates Blackwater&#x27;s Erik Prince over alleged support for Haftar\n\nby  \u301023\u2020SafaAlharathy\u3011 Sun, 18/08/2024 - 14:14\n\n  * \u301024\u2020Share\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\n  * \u301025\u2020Tweet\u2020twitter.com\u3011\n\n[Image 0: fbi] \n\nThe FBI has launched an investigation into Erik Prince, the former head of the private security firm Blackwater and an ally of former US President Donald Trump, over his alleged involvement in illegal arms sales and money laundering. The probe is also examining Prince\u2019s connections with foreign intelligence and military entities, including his reported support for rogue military commander Khalifa Haftar.\n\nAccording to the \u201cWashington Babylon\u201d newspaper, the investigation focuses on three main areas. Firstly, Prince is suspected of facilitating the illegal transfer of weapons to Haftar, a violation of the international arms embargo on Libya. Prince is alleged to have played a significant role in assisting Haftar during his 2019 attempt to overthrow Libya\u2019s internationally recognized government.\n\nThe investigation also scrutinizes whether Prince\u2019s laundered money is linked to his support for Haftar. The United Nations has estimated the cost of Prince\u2019s assistance to Haftar at $80 million, with much of the funding reportedly originating from the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAdditionally, the FBI is exploring the broader relationship between Prince and Haftar, particularly Prince\u2019s involvement in providing military support and operational planning for Haftar\u2019s forces.\n\nTags: \u301026\u2020Khalifa Haftar\u3011 \u301027\u2020blackwater\u3011 \u301028\u2020mercenaries\u3011 \n\n### Read Also:\n\n\u301029\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301029\u2020Amnesty International urges Haftar to unveil fate of Mahdi Al-Barghathi \u3011\n\nOctober 03, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301030\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301030\u2020Canada accuses Chinese officials of trying to smuggle drones to Haftar\u3011\n\nSeptember 28, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301031\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301031\u2020Commander of US AFRICOM reviews with Haftar strengthening US-Libyan partnership\u3011\n\nAugust 28, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301032\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301032\u2020Haftar rejects change of CBL governor in meeting with UN envoy\u3011\n\nAugust 27, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301033\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301033\u2020Haftar&#x27;s son meets with Turkish Foreign Minister in Ankara\u3011\n\nJuly 25, 2024 0 comment\n\n\u301034\u2020 \u3011  \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n\n#### \u301034\u2020Italy blocks shipment of Chinese drones bound for Haftar\u3011\n\nJuly 02, 2024 0 comment\n\n### Must read\n\n#### \u301035\u2020Libyan Football Federation apologizes to fans for disruption caused by Nigerian Football Federation\u3011\n\nOctober 15, 2024 \u301035\u2020 0\u3011 0 Shares\n\n\u301035\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Libyan Football Federation condemned the Nigerian Football Federation&#x27;s actions in refusing to play the return match in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers, stressi\n\n#### \u301036\u2020Sudanese army seizes weapons coming from Benghazi to back up Hemedti&#x27;s RSF \u3011\n\nOctober 13, 2024 \u301036\u2020 0\u3011 0 Shares\n\n\u301036\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Sudanese newspaper &quot;Al-Mandara News&quot; reported that the Sudanese army seized arms shipments belonging to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) under the command of Hemedti, s\n\n#### \u301037\u2020Dbeibah: We&#x27;ve started resolving years-long obstacles in Libya&#x27;s political crisis\u3011\n\nOctober 12, 2024 \u301037\u2020 0\u3011 0 Shares\n\n\u301037\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u200eThe Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah said that the Libyan political scene &quot;is entering a new phase, after his government has begun taking decisive steps to reso\n\n### News In Brief\n\n#### \u301038\u2020Koury reviews Libyan developments with UAE Minister of State in Abu Dhabi\u3011\n\nOctober 15, 2024\n\n\u301038\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Acting Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), Stephanie Koury, has held a meeting in\n\n#### \u301039\u2020Al-Baour discusses with Undersecretary of British Foreign Office bilateral cooperation \u3011\n\nOctober 15, 2024\n\n\u301039\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Government of National Unity (GNU), Taher Al-Baour, has discussed with the Undersecretary of the British Foreign Office, Phi\n\n#### \u301040\u2020New UN Humanitarian Coordinator meets with Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs\u3011\n\nOctober 15, 2024\n\n\u301040\u2020 \u3011 \n\nThe Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Humanitarian Coordinator in Libya, Aeneas Chapinga Chuma, has met with the Acting Min\n\n\u301041\u2020MORE\u3011 \n\n### Main Menu\n\n  * \u30104\u2020Home\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020About Us\u3011\n  * \u301042\u2020Monthly Archive\u3011\n  * \u301043\u2020Exchange Rates\u3011\n  * \u301044\u2020Advertise With Us\u3011\n  * \u301045\u2020Terms &amp; Conditions\u3011\n\n### Categories\n\n  * \u30105\u2020News\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020Economy\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020Sports\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Opinions\u3011\n  * \u30109\u2020Variety\u3011\n  * \u301018\u2020Health\u3011\n  * \u301019\u2020Education\u3011\n\n### Multimedi"}, {"matched_text": "\u30107\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1028, "end_idx": 1038, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "Off Leash: Inside the Secret, Global, Far-Right Group Chat   | The New Republic", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/182008/erik-prince-secret-global-group-chat-off-leash", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nOff Leash was still active as of Wednesday, though I expect it won\u2019t be, at least in its current form, for much longer, given that the conversation Wednesday included much discussion about their security being breached, which became evident after I reached out to participants for comment.

Sadly, wrote Goldhorn, whose LinkedIn profile says he has \u201ca passion for strategic planning,\u201d there was no one in the Israeli government with \u201cthe balls nor vision to go all those extra miles.\u201d\n\nIran: Off Leash\u2019s Public Enemy No. 1 \n\nIt was hard to keep track of all the wars, invasions, covert operations, coups, and assassinations Off Leash members favored. One region ripe for a bit of good old-fashioned Western intervention was Africa, which was described as a \u201cpot about to boil over\u201d by \u301019\u2020Emma Priestley\u2020otp.investis.com\u3011, who posts as \u201cCustomer\u201d in the group chat and is the \u301019\u2020CEO of GoldStone Resources Limited\u2020otp.investis.com\u3011 in Jersey, the English Channel island that is one of the world\u2019s most popular offshore secrecy havens. China would have to be taken down a peg as well, particularly as Biden wasn\u2019t going to stop the country \u201cfrom doing a damn thing,\u201d and indeed he would pave the way for it to do \u201cwhatever it is they want to accomplish,\u201d posted Randy Couture, the former UFC heavyweight champion and actor who had the role of arsonist and killer Jason Duclair in the TV series Hawaii Five-0 and starred in the 2011 movie Setup with 50 Cent and Bruce Willis.\n\nBut the No. 1 target on Off Leash\u2019s hit list, by orders of magnitude, was Iran. \u201cFollow the source of evil,\u201d wrote Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke, who served as interior secretary under Trump. \u201cHamas. Hezbollah. Houthis. Iran is the center of gravity.\u201d\n\n\u201cZinke is right,\u201d agreed Tennessee Congressman Mark Green of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels"}, {"matched_text": "\u30108\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1038, "end_idx": 1048, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "Erik Prince says China likely to attack Taiwan in 2024\n | Taiwan News | Dec. 31, 2023 16:58", "url": "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/5069317", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\n\u301021\u2020Opinion\u3011\n\n\u301022\u2020World\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020Sponsored\u3011\n\n[Image 4: search]\n\nMORE\n\n[Image 5: search]\n\n\u30102\u2020Politics\u3011[Image 6: arrow-down]\n\n\u30103\u2020All\u3011\u30104\u2020Foreign Affairs\u3011\u30105\u2020Cross-strait\u3011\n\n\u30106\u2020Business\u3011[Image 7: arrow-down]\n\n\u30107\u2020All\u3011\u30108\u2020Investing\u3011\n\n\u30109\u2020Tech\u3011\n\n\u301010\u2020Society\u3011\n\n\u301011\u2020Health\u3011\n\n\u301012\u2020Culture\u3011\n\n\u301013\u2020Environment\u3011\n\n\u301014\u2020Lifestyle\u3011[Image 8: arrow-down]\n\n\u301015\u2020All\u3011\u301016\u2020Cuisine\u3011\u301017\u2020Travel\u3011\u301018\u2020Entertainment\u3011\u301019\u2020Variety\u3011\u301020\u2020Sports\u3011\n\n\u301021\u2020Opinion\u3011\n\n\u301022\u2020World\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020Sponsored\u3011\n\n[Image 9: FB][Image 10: X][Image 11: Youtube][Image 12: IG]\n\nLoading...\n\n\u301024\u2020About Us\u2020taiwannews.com.tw\u3011\u301025\u2020Contact Us\u3011\u301026\u2020Directory of Taiwan\u2020directory.taiwannews.com.tw\u3011\n\n[Image 13: FB][Image 14: X][Image 15: Youtube][Image 16: IG]\n\n\u301024\u2020About Us\u2020taiwannews.com.tw\u3011\u301025\u2020Contact Us\u3011\u301026\u2020Directory of Taiwan\u2020directory.taiwannews.com.tw\u3011\n\n[Image 17: FB][Image 18: X][Image 19: Youtube][Image 20: IG]\n\nTaiwan News \u00a9 2024 All Rights Reserved.\n\n\u30101\u2020Home\u3011\n\n/\n\n\u301022\u2020World\u3011\n\n# Erik Prince says China likely to attack Taiwan in 2024 \n\nXi Jinping must feel &#x27;door is wide open&#x27; amid declining US credibility under Biden administration, says former Blackwater chair \n\nDec. 31, 2023 16:58\n\n[Image 21: Erik Prince in New York City, November 2019. (Reuters photo) ]\n\nErik Prince in New York City, November 2019. (Reuters photo) \n\n38154 \n\nTAIPEI (Taiwan News) \u2014 In a video interview on the U.K.\u2019s GB News filmed on Thursday (Dec. 28), Erik Prince, a military contractor known for founding the Blackwater organization, said he expects China to target Taiwan militarily in the spring of 2024.\n\nPrince, a military strategist and former U.S. Navy Seal, was being \u301027\u2020interviewed\u2020www.gbnews.com\u3011 by Jacob Rees-Mogg about U.S. foreign policy setbacks under the Biden administration and the pressures faced by the U.S. military around the world. Prince said that amid declining U.S. credibility abroad, Chinese leader Xi Jinping (\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73) may try to \u201cbluster his way\u201d into a takeover of Taiwan, saying that \u201cit must feel like the door is wide open for them to do whatever it is they want to do.\u201d\n\nPrince\u2019s comments came one day after Xi Jinping, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, resolutely vowed to stop anyone from \u201cmaking Taiwan secede from China,\u201d calling \u301028\u2020unification\u3011 an \u201cinevitable trend.\u201d\n\nIn Prince\u2019s remarks, he criticized the U.S. \u201cinability to finish properly in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d which he credits for the increase of military threats across the world that have taken shape under the Biden administration. In addition to ongoing conflicts involving Ukraine and Israel, Prince also mentioned escalating conflicts in the wider Middle East, which now include attacks by Houthi rebels targeting shipping vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nSpeaking about a timeline for a potential attack by China on Taiwan, Prince said May or June 2024 is a likely window for Beijing to begin cross-strait naval operations. &quot;If they are going to take Taiwan by force, I would predict that they are going to do something this spring,&quot; Prince said, as reported by \u301029\u2020GB News\u2020www.gbnews.com\u3011.\n\nThe day after Prince made his prediction on GB News, China announced a shakeup in its military command. With only two weeks before Taiwan&#x27;s elections, Beijing appointed PLAN \u301030\u2020Admiral Dong Jun\u3011 as its newest Minister of National Defense.\n\nAfter leaving Blackwater and selling the company in 2010, Erik Prince\u2019s connections to CIA training programs were revealed in 2013. Around 2014, Prince became the chairman of a private security and logistics firm called the Frontier Services Group, a Chinese-owned company based in Hong Kong and involved in private security contract work in Africa.\n\nPrince stepped down as chairman of the Frontier Services Group in April 2021 but is still the head of a similar organization called the Frontier Resource Group, which has almost no online footprint as of publication.\n\n\u301031\u2020# Chinese invasion of Taiwan\u3011\u301032\u2020# Biden Administration\u3011\u301033\u2020# Erik Prince\u3011\u301034\u2020# Xi Jinping\u3011\n\n# Related Articles\n\n* * *\n\n\u301035\u2020Ex-Australia PM calls for effective deterrent against China\u2019s threats to annex Taiwan Oct. 22, 2024 14:56\u3011\u301036\u2020Harris says Taiwan &#x27;has right to defend itself&#x27; Oct. 17, 2024 10:41\u3011\u301037\u2020Trump claims China will not invade Taiwan if he is elected Oct. 16, 2024 16:43\u3011\u301038\u2020Former AIT chair says Article 8 of China\u2019s Anti-Secession Law is time bomb Oct. 16, 2024 13:43\u3011\u301039\u2020Poll shows 36% of Americans support sending troops to defend Taiwan Oct. 9, 2024 16:26\u3011\u301040\u2020Harris backs &#x27;Taiwan&#x27;s ability to defend itself&#x27; Oct. 8, 2024 14:27\u3011\n\n# MOST READ\n\n* * *\n\n\u301041\u2020Harvard punishes Taiwanese American student for disrupting Chinese ambassador\u3011\u301042\u2020Tropical Storm Trami forecast to steer south of Taiwan\u3011\u301043\u2020Tropi"}], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "4678175a-6ced-49e9-8a45-f05ed4ccce02", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8d71cd7a39500dfa-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4678175a-6ced-49e9-8a45-f05ed4ccce02", "children": ["aaa26526-7874-4494-8d4d-bf8cd90a3b44"]}, "aaa26526-7874-4494-8d4d-bf8cd90a3b44": { "message": { "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729687407.377412, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["can you tell me the time?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8d71d001c9370dfa-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e9cbab1e-c480-4b78-b163-8633d1a6379c", "children": ["062ad643-5f96-43d0-ac9b-9ab93b7c1214"]}, "062ad643-5f96-43d0-ac9b-9ab93b7c1214": { "message": { "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729687412.551516, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The current time is 10:40 AM UTC on October 23, 2024.

Unlike THC, which is known for its psychoactive properties that cause the &quot;high,&quot; THCv has been shown to have more subtle, and in some cases, opposing effects.\n\nKey points about THCv:\n\n1. **Appetite Suppression**: THCv is known for its potential to suppress appetite, which is the opposite of THC, which is often associated with increasing hunger (the &quot;munchies&quot;). This has sparked interest in THCv for weight management or obesity treatment.\n\n2. **Psychoactive Effects**: At low doses, THCv is not significantly psychoactive, meaning it doesn\u2019t cause a strong high. However, at higher doses, it can produce effects similar to THC, though they are often described as clearer-headed and shorter-lasting.\n\n3. **Potential Health Benefits**: Early research suggests THCv may have therapeutic potential in areas such as reducing insulin resistance in diabetes, managing anxiety, and possibly aiding in bone growth. It\u2019s also being studied for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, which could make it useful in treating conditions like Parkinson&#x27;s disease.\n\n4. **Energy Boost and Focus**: Some users report that THCv provides an energizing and focusing effect, which differs from the more sedative qualities of certain THC-rich cannabis strains.\n\nTHCv is not as abundant as THC or CBD in most cannabis strains, but breeders are developing strains with higher THCv content due to its unique potential benefits."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

That&#x27;s a cool project! I can help you troubleshoot and get back on track. Here&#x27;s a quick outline of the typical process, and maybe I can help identify where things went sideways:\n\n### Steps to Build an Alexa Skill with OpenAI Integration\n\n1. **Set Up Your Alexa Developer Account**:\n   - You\u2019ll need an Alexa Developer account at [developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com).\n   - Create a new skill and choose a custom interaction model.\n\n2. **Design the Interaction Model**:\n   - Create intents (e.g., &quot;AskOpenAIIntent&quot;) and sample utterances (e.g., &quot;ask OpenAI {question}&quot;) in the Alexa developer console.\n\n3. **Create an AWS Lambda Function**:\n   - You need to link the Alexa skill with a backend service. AWS Lambda is commonly used.\n   - Write your Lambda function in Node.js or Python.\n   - Make sure it sends requests to OpenAI&#x27;s API (you\u2019ll use the OpenAI API key here).\n\n4. **Integrate OpenAI API**:\n   - You will need to set up a request to OpenAI (the `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4` model, for example) in your Lambda function.\n   - Use something like `axios` or `fetch` to send a request to OpenAI and get a response.\n\n5. **Configure Skill Permissions**:\n   - Make sure your Alexa skill has permission to access the Lambda function.\n   - Set up endpoints in the Alexa console for the Lambda function.\n\n6. **Testing**:\n   - Test your skill with the Alexa simulator in the developer console or with an actual Echo device.\n\n### Snags You Might Have Hit\n\n- **Lambda Function Errors**: Issues connecting to OpenAI (API key not working, wrong endpoint).\n- **Alexa Interaction Model Setup**: Intents or sample utterances might be incorrectly configured.\n- **Node.js Setup**: If you&#x27;re using `npm init` as part of the setup for your backend (Lambda function), there could be an issue with dependencies.\n\n### Key Packages to Install (Node.js)\nIf you\u2019re working in Node.js, make sure to have these dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install axios\nnpm install openai\n```\n\nLet me know what part of the process you got stuck on, and I can provide more specific guidance or code snippets!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

**Possible Causes**:\n   - **Skill not deployed**: Make sure the latest version of the skill is deployed to Alexa\u2019s development environment.\n   - **Locale Mismatch**: Check if the skill supports the `en-US` locale and that it has the required metadata configured for that locale.\n   - **Bundle Issue**: Verify that the skill\u2019s bundle contains all the necessary components (interaction model, language model, etc.).\n\n3. **Fixes to Try**:\n   - **Check Skill Configuration**: Ensure that the skill&#x27;s configuration for the `en-US` locale is correct, including the metadata in the Alexa Developer Console.\n   - **Redeploy the Skill**: If there were any recent changes, redeploy the skill from your environment to ensure the skill bundle is properly updated.\n   - **Log More Details**: If possible, add more detailed logging to your Lambda function or skill to capture what might be missing or misconfigured.\n   - **Test with a Different Locale**: If other locales are working, the issue might be specific to the `en-US` setup.\n\nIf the issue persists after redeployment and configuration checks, you might want to try testing in the Alexa Developer Console or using AWS CloudWatch logs to get more insights into what\u2019s causing the failure during execution."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

API definitions specify the requests that your skill code can handle.\r\n\r\nAs the user interacts with your skill, Alexa Conversations predicts the correct API based on the current dialog context. API definitions are analogous to intents in intent-based dialog models.\r\n\r\nGet Started\r\n\r\nTo get started with Alexa Conversations, you can step through a pet match skill-building tutorial, download the code for a pizza-ordering reference skill, or use an Alexa-hosted sample skill template that includes an Alexa Conversations skill configuration and back-end skill code.\r\nExample\r\nConsider a weather skill that has a GetWeather API that accepts two arguments (date and city) and returns a returnedWeather value that contains properties for cityName, date, highTemperature, and lowTemperature. To use this API in an Alexa Conversations skill, you must create an API definition for the GetWeather API when you configure your skill in the developer console.\r\n\r\nWhen you annotate dialogs for your skill, the API definitions are often what tie the user line and the Alexa line together. The following example shows what one dialog in your skill might be:\r\n\r\nUser: What&#x27;s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?\r\nAlexa: Tomorrow in Seattle, you can expect a high of 71 degrees and a low of 57 degrees.\r\n\r\nWhen you annotate this dialog, you associate both the user utterance group and the Alexa response with the GetWeather API definition. The user utterance group provides the inputs to the API, and the Alexa response formats the output of the API into Alexa TTS.\r\n\r\nAPI definitions, slot types, and responses\r\nWhen you define an API, you specify an API name, input arguments, and a return type. Because APIs tie into slot types and responses, keep in mind that you also must do the following:\r\n\r\nCreate slot types for any API arguments and return types that aren&#x27;t built-in types. For details, see Use Slot Types.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your weather skill returns the response, &quot;Tomorrow in Seattle, you can expect a high of 71 degrees and a low of 57 degrees,&quot; you might create a returnedWeather slot type that contains a city, date, high temperature, and low temperature. For details about slot types, see Use Slot Types in Alexa Conversations.\r\nCreate responses to define how Alexa responds to the user. For details, see Define Responses from Alexa for Alexa Conversations.\r\nAPI definitions and dialog acts\r\nEach API must have at least one dialog that uses the Request Args dialog act. You can&#x27;t simply have a dialog where the user provides your arguments as part of the initial utterance.\r\n\r\nAPI arguments\r\nFor higher API prediction accuracy, we recommend the following:\r\n\r\nFive or fewer arguments per API.\r\nDistinct types of arguments. For example, one argument of type AMAZON.NUMBER and another argument of type AMAZON.US_CITY typically performs better than two arguments that are both of type AMAZON.NUMBER.\r\nDefine an API\r\nYou define APIs to your skill in the developer console as follows.\r\n\r\n Important: If you don&#x27;t have all the information that you need to create the API definition, you can skip parts of the API definition and come back to them later. However, if you try to build the model, the build fails until you specify all of the required items.\r\nTo create an API definition\r\n\r\nLog in to the developer console, and then navigate to your Alexa Conversations skill.\r\nIn the left pane, click API Definitions.\r\nClick Add API Definition.\r\nEnter a name for the API.\r\nIf the API has arguments, do the following:\r\n\r\n Note: Alexa Conversations currently doesn&#x27;t support APIs that take multiple list arguments. (Each API can have at most one list argument.)\r\nUnder Arguments, click Add Argument.\r\nEnter the argument name and select a slot type.\r\nClick Add Argument to add other arguments, if applicable.\r\nUnder Return, select the slot type of the return value.\r\nFor details about slot types, see Use Slot Types in Alexa Conversations.\r\nIn the header bar, click Save.\r\nRelated topics\r\nDefine Responses from Alexa for Alexa Conversations\r\nAbout Alexa Conversations\r\nGet Started with Alexa Conversations\r\nWas this page helpful? \r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nProvide feedback\r\nLast updated: Nov 27, 2023\n\n\nCAN I USE THIS AND MAKE THE API THEOPEN API AND THE ARGUMENT COULD BE A QUESTION?

Here\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n### Step-by-Step Overview:\n\n1. **Define the API** in the Alexa Developer Console:\n   - You\u2019ll create an API definition that connects to **The Open API** or another external API.\n   - The argument, which could be a **user&#x27;s question**, will be processed as input, and the API will return the relevant data.\n\n2. **Create Slot Types**:\n   - Since Alexa uses slot types to understand and process input, you&#x27;ll need to create custom slot types that map to the API&#x27;s parameters.\n   - For example, if the user&#x27;s question asks for &quot;weather in Seattle tomorrow,&quot; you\u2019ll need to create a slot type for cities (`AMAZON.US_CITY`) and dates (`AMAZON.DATE`).\n\n3. **Handle the Question as an Argument**:\n   - You can configure the argument to be the user&#x27;s question or part of the conversation. For example, you can take an open-ended question like &quot;What is the weather tomorrow in Seattle?&quot; and pass the relevant data (city, date) to **The Open API**.\n   - Make sure to associate the question with the right API and return the correct response type (i.e., formatted weather data).\n\n### Example Setup for Weather Query:\n\n- **API Definition**:\n  - **API Name**: `GetWeatherAPI`\n  - **Arguments**:\n    - `city` (Slot type: `AMAZON.US_CITY`)\n    - `date` (Slot type: `AMAZON.DATE`)\n  - **Return Type**:\n    - `returnedWeather` (a custom slot type that contains `city`, `date`, `highTemperature`, and `lowTemperature`)\n\n- **Interaction Flow**:\n   1. **User Question**: &quot;What&#x27;s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?&quot;\n   2. **Alexa Conversation**:\n      - Alexa identifies the intent (weather query) and matches the API (`GetWeatherAPI`).\n      - The inputs (city: &quot;Seattle&quot;, date: &quot;tomorrow&quot;) are passed to the API.\n   3. **API Response**:\n      - The API (The Open API) returns data for &quot;Seattle&quot; and &quot;tomorrow.&quot;\n   4. **Alexa Response**:\n      - Alexa formats the response: &quot;Tomorrow in Seattle, the high will be 71 degrees and the low will be 57 degrees.&quot;\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **API Design**: When integrating The Open API, ensure your skill\u2019s backend can process the request and call The Open API, passing along the necessary parameters (like the user&#x27;s question).\n- **User Input as a Question**: Yes, you can pass open-ended questions as input, but you\u2019ll need to map relevant slots from that question to the API arguments. Use dialog management to capture and clarify the user\u2019s intent if needed.\n- **Error Handling**: Plan for cases where the API might not have enough data or when the user&#x27;s input is ambiguous (e.g., &quot;What is the weather?&quot; without a city or date).\n\n### Example of an API Definition for Open API:\n\n1. **API Name**: `TheOpenAPI`\n2. **Arguments**:\n   - `question` (Slot type: `AMAZON.SearchQuery`) \u2013 which can capture the user&#x27;s question.\n3. **Return**: You\u2019ll need to specify the return slot type based on the kind of response you expect from The Open API (e.g., text or formatted data).\n4. **Backend Code**: Ensure your backend Lambda function processes the `question`, calls The Open API, and then returns a response formatted for Alexa.\n\nBy following this setup, you can create an Alexa skill using Alexa Conversations to call external APIs like The Open API and handle user questions as arguments.

The Open API will provide a response under the specific constraint (like 1000 characters or less), which Alexa will then vocalize.\n\n### 2. **Steps to Build the Skill**:\n\n#### A. **Skill Design in Alexa Conversations**:\n1. **Create the API Definition**:\n   - **API Name**: `OpenAPIWeatherQuery`\n   - **Argument**: \n     - `question` (Type: `AMAZON.SearchQuery`) \u2013 this captures the entire user query, such as &quot;What&#x27;s the weather tomorrow in Seattle?&quot;\n   - **Return Type**: A custom slot that will hold the Open API response.\n     - You can define a return type like `response` which will be the formatted text that the Open API sends back (i.e., the weather information).\n\n#### B. **Interaction Flow**:\n   1. **User Input**: &quot;What&#x27;s the weather like tomorrow in Seattle?&quot;\n   2. **Alexa&#x27;s Action**: \n      - Alexa recognizes the intent and extracts the entire user query as `question`. \n      - Alexa sends the user query to **The Open API** using the custom API (`OpenAPIWeatherQuery`) you defined.\n   3. **API Call**:\n      - The backend service (via Lambda function or another backend) receives the user query, sends it to **The Open API**, and retrieves a weather response (formatted to be under 1000 characters).\n   4. **Alexa Response**:\n      - Alexa receives the response and speaks it aloud to the user.\n      - Skill ends.\n\n#### C. **Backend Logic in AWS Lambda**:\n   - **Function**: Your Lambda function needs to accept the user input (the question), forward it to The Open API, and process the response.\n   - **Request Flow**: \n     - The function will take the `question` (e.g., &quot;What&#x27;s the weather tomorrow in Seattle?&quot;), use it to call The Open API, and retrieve the formatted weather response.\n     - Limit the response size to 1000 characters or format it accordingly in your Lambda function.\n   \n   - **Lambda Code Example (Node.js)**:\n     ```javascript\n     const axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n\n     exports.handler = async function (event) {\n         try {\n             const userQuery = event.request.intent.slots.question.value;\n             \n             // Make a call to The Open API (replace with actual API endpoint)\n             const apiResponse = await axios.post(&#x27;https://api.theopenapi.com/weather&#x27;, {\n                 query: userQuery,\n                 maxLength: 1000  // Limiting the response to 1000 characters\n             });\n             \n             const weatherResponse = apiResponse.data.response;\n             \n             // Return the response to Alexa\n             return {\n                 version: &#x27;1.0&#x27;,\n                 response: {\n                     outputSpeech: {\n                         type: &#x27;PlainText&#x27;,\n                         text: weatherResponse\n                     },\n                     shouldEndSession: true\n                 }\n             };\n         } catch (error) {\n             console.error(error);\n             return {\n                 version: &#x27;1.0&#x27;,\n                 response: {\n                     outputSpeech: {\n                         type: &#x27;PlainText&#x27;,\n                         text: &#x27;I am having trouble getting the weather information right now. Please try again later.&#x27;\n                     },\n                     shouldEndSession: true\n                 }\n             };\n         }\n     };\n     ```\n\n#### D. **Configuring the API**:\n- In **Alexa Developer Console**, go to **API Definitions** and define the `OpenAPIWeatherQuery` as described earlier.\n- Make sure the argument (question) is passed correctly from Alexa to your backend.\n\n### 3. **Summary of Steps**:\n1. **API Definition**: Create the API in Alexa Conversations, capturing the user question as an argument.\n2. **Lambda Function**: Build the backend logic (using AWS Lambda) to process the user input, call The Open API, and return a response.\n3. **API Call**: The Lambda function will handle the API call to The Open API, retrieve the result, and format it to be 1000 characters or less.\n4. **Alexa Response**: The response from The Open API is passed back to Alexa, and Alexa speaks it to the user.\n5. **Session End**: Once Alexa delivers the information, the skill session ends.\n\nThis setup allows Alexa to dynamically query The Open API with the user\u2019s question, retrieve the response, and speak it as part of the Alexa Conversations framework.

It seems you created a custom slot type to handle the user input instead of using a predefined one like `AMAZON.SearchQuery`. That&#x27;s perfectly fine.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do to complete the setup:\n\n1. **Name the Argument**: \n   - Give your custom slot type a name that reflects what it will capture. For example, you can name it `UserQuestion` since it will be used to hold the user&#x27;s question about the weather.\n   \n2. **Slot Type with Properties**:\n   - Since you mentioned it didn&#x27;t have `SearchQuery` as an option, you can create a slot type that can handle freeform text input.\n   - Create a slot type named `UserQuestionType` and use the **Slot Type with Properties** option. This means you can customize it to capture any kind of open-ended response.\n\n3. **Return Type**:\n   - In the **Return Type** section, you can create a slot type for the response that your API will return.\n   - Create a custom slot type named `WeatherResponse` to store the weather information from The Open API response.\n\n4. **Linking to Backend**:\n   - Make sure your backend Lambda function (Node.js) is set up to receive this custom slot type as an argument and process it.\n   - Modify the Lambda to map the incoming `UserQuestion` slot to the appropriate API request for The Open API.\n\n### Example Code Adjustments:\n\nHere&#x27;s how you can adapt the Lambda code to use the custom slot type:\n\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require(&#x27;ask-sdk-core&#x27;);\nconst axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;); // Using axios to make API calls\n\n/**\n * API Handler for GetWeather API\n *\n * @param handlerInput\n * @returns API response object\n */\nconst GetWeatherApiHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return util.isApiRequest(handlerInput, &#x27;GetWeather&#x27;);\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        console.log(&quot;Api Request [GetWeather]: &quot;, JSON.stringify(handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request, null, 2));\n\n        // Extract the user question from the API arguments\n        const args = util.getApiArguments(handlerInput);\n        const userQuestion = args.UserQuestion;  // Assuming &#x27;UserQuestion&#x27; is your custom argument name\n\n        try {\n            // Make the API request to The Open API using the user input as the question\n            const apiResponse = await axios.post(&#x27;https://api.theopenapi.com/weather&#x27;, {\n                query: userQuestion,\n                maxLength: 1000  // Optional limit for response length\n            });\n\n            const weatherInfo = apiResponse.data.response; // Assuming the response contains a &#x27;response&#x27; key\n\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .withApiResponse({\n                    WeatherResponse: weatherInfo.substring(0, 1000)  // Limiting the response to 1000 characters\n                })\n                .withShouldEndSession(true)\n                .getResponse();\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.error(&quot;Error calling The Open API: &quot;, error);\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(&quot;Sorry, I&#x27;m having trouble getting the weather information right now. Please try again later.&quot;)\n                .withShouldEndSession(true)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Steps Recap:\n\n1. **API Arguments**:\n   - You have already created a custom slot type for the question argument.\n   - Name the argument `UserQuestion` or something similar to reflect its purpose.\n\n2. **Return Type**:\n   - Create a new custom slot type for the API response, such as `WeatherResponse`, and configure it in the API Definition screen under **Return Type**.\n\n3. **Lambda Integration**:\n   - In your Lambda function, adjust the code to accept the argument `UserQuestion` and use it to query The Open API.\n\nAfter these adjustments, Alexa should be able to accept open-ended questions, pass them to the backend, and provide a response based on the output from The Open API.

If `AMAZON.SearchQuery` wasn&#x27;t available, creating a custom slot type is the right approach. Here\u2019s how you can proceed effectively with your custom slot to ensure it works as intended:\n\n### Step-by-Step Custom Slot Setup:\n\n1. **Custom Slot Type for User Questions**:\n   - Since you need the slot to capture a wide range of open-ended input (like a weather question), create a new slot type named something like `UserQuestionType`.\n   - You don\u2019t need to add specific values to this slot type\u2014leave it empty to allow for any kind of freeform user input.\n\n2. **Using Your Custom Slot in the API Definition**:\n   - **API Name**: `GetWeatherAPI`\n   - **Argument**: \n     - Add a new argument named `UserQuestion` (or similar) and assign your custom slot type (`UserQuestionType`) to it.\n   - **Return Type**:\n     - You will also need to define a return type slot for the response, named something like `WeatherResponseType`. This return type will hold the response that you will receive from The Open API.\n\n3. **Backend (Lambda) Changes**:\n   - In your backend (AWS Lambda), you need to ensure that the argument from Alexa is processed properly. Since the input will be unstructured, use the full input to send to your external API.\n\n### Lambda Function Example:\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify the Lambda function to work with your custom slot:\n\n```javascript\nconst Alexa = require(&#x27;ask-sdk-core&#x27;);\nconst axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n\n/**\n * API Handler for GetWeather API\n *\n * @param handlerInput\n * @returns API response object\n */\nconst GetWeatherApiHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return util.isApiRequest(handlerInput, &#x27;GetWeather&#x27;);  // Replace &#x27;GetWeather&#x27; with your API name\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        console.log(&quot;API Request [GetWeather]: &quot;, JSON.stringify(handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request, null, 2));\n\n        // Extract the UserQuestion from the API arguments\n        const args = util.getApiArguments(handlerInput);\n        const userQuestion = args.UserQuestion;  // This is the name you gave in the API definition\n\n        try {\n            // Make a request to The Open API with the user&#x27;s question\n            const apiResponse = await axios.post(&#x27;https://api.theopenapi.com/weather&#x27;, {\n                query: userQuestion,\n                maxLength: 1000  // Limit response length if needed\n            });\n\n            const weatherInfo = apiResponse.data.response;  // Assuming response has &#x27;response&#x27; field\n\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .withApiResponse({\n                    WeatherResponse: weatherInfo.substring(0, 1000)  // Ensure response length is within limits\n                })\n                .withShouldEndSession(true)\n                .getResponse();\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.error(&quot;Error calling The Open API: &quot;, error);\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(&quot;Sorry, I couldn&#x27;t get the weather information. Please try again later.&quot;)\n                .withShouldEndSession(true)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n/**\n * Fallback Intent Handler\n */\nconst FallbackIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;;\n    },\n    handle(handlerInput) {\n        const speechOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t understand that. You can ask about the weather, for example.&quot;;\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(speechOutput)\n            .reprompt(speechOutput)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n\n// Error handler for managing errors gracefully\nconst ErrorHandler = {\n    canHandle() {\n        return true;\n    },\n    handle(handlerInput, error) {\n        console.error(`Error handled: ${error.stack}`);\n        const speakOutput = &quot;Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.&quot;;\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(speakOutput)\n            .reprompt(speakOutput)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n\n// Logging request and response for debugging purposes\nconst LogRequestInterceptor = {\n    process(handlerInput) {\n        console.log(`REQUEST ENVELOPE = ${JSON.stringify(handlerInput.requestEnvelope)}`);\n    },\n};\n\nconst LogResponseInterceptor = {\n    process(handlerInput, response) {\n        console.log(`RESPONSE = ${JSON.stringify(response)}`);\n    },\n};\n\n// Skill Builder\nexports.handler = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()\n    .addRequestHandlers(\n        GetWeatherApiHandler,\n        FallbackIntentHandler,\n    )\n    .addErrorHandlers(ErrorHandler)\n    .addRequestInterceptors(LogRequestInterceptor)\n    .addResponseInterceptors(LogResponseInterceptor)\n    .lambda();\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Custom Slot Type Handling**:\n  - The custom slot `UserQuestionType` should be flexible enough to handle user utterances like &quot;What&#x27;s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?&quot;.\n  - The skill should recognize this input without requiring exact pre-defined values.\n\n- **Lambda Function**:\n  - The `userQuestion` argument captured from the API definition will be used to make a POST request to **The Open API**.\n  - It\u2019s crucial to process any unstructured input properly to make sure the question is compatible with The Open API&#x27;s expected parameters.\n\n- **Return Type**:\n  - The return type `WeatherResponseType` should be able to handle whatever The Open API sends back. This type will be used to convert the response into a form that Alexa can speak back to the user.\n\n- **Testing**:\n  - Since you are using a custom slot type, thorough testing will be essential to make sure the user\u2019s input is being properly captured and processed.\n  - Test a range of different phrasings and questions to see how Alexa handles the input and returns the response.\n\nThis should give you a good foundation to get the skill working properly, even without `AMAZON.SearchQuery` being available.

Here&#x27;s how you can do it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions for Testing with Postman:\n\n1. **Open Postman**:\n   - If you haven&#x27;t already installed it, download and install **Postman** from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).\n\n2. **Create a New Request**:\n   - Click on **New** and select **HTTP Request**.\n\n3. **Set Up the Request**:\n   - **Method**: Select `POST`.\n   - **URL**: Enter `https://api.theopenapi.com/endpoint` (replace this with the correct API URL if different).\n\n4. **Add Headers**:\n   - Click on the **Headers** tab.\n   - Add a new header:\n     - **Key**: `Authorization`\n     - **Value**: `Bearer YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY` (replace `YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY` with your actual API key).\n\n5. **Set the Body**:\n   - Click on the **Body** tab and select `raw`.\n   - Choose `JSON` from the dropdown.\n   - Add the request body. For example:\n     ```json\n     {\n       &quot;query&quot;: &quot;What&#x27;s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?&quot;,\n       &quot;maxLength&quot;: 1000\n     }\n     ```\n\n6. **Send the Request**:\n   - Click on the **Send** button.\n\n7. **Check the Response**:\n   - If the API key is valid, you should receive a **200 OK** response with the expected data in the response body.\n   - If the API key is invalid, you will likely receive an error message, such as **401 Unauthorized**.\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n- If you get a **401 Unauthorized** response, double-check your API key.\n- Ensure you are using the correct endpoint and that the header `Authorization` includes `Bearer` followed by a space and the key.\n- If there are any other errors, review the error message to understand what might be missing.\n\nThis process should help you verify if your API key is correct and if your request format works as expected."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Below are two different approaches:\n\n### 1. Using Node.js and NPM Modules in PowerShell\nYou can make API calls using Node.js on your computer and invoke the script from PowerShell. Here&#x27;s how:\n\n1. **Install Node.js**: First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n2. **Install Axios or Other HTTP Client Libraries**:\n   - Open **PowerShell**.\n   - Install Axios using **npm**:\n     ```powershell\n     npm install axios\n     ```\n\n3. **Create a JavaScript File (e.g., `callAPI.js`)**:\n   ```javascript\n   const axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n\n   // Replace &#x27;YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY&#x27; with your actual key\n   const apiKey = &#x27;YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY&#x27;;\n   const url = &#x27;https://api.theopenapi.com/endpoint&#x27;;\n\n   const data = {\n       query: &quot;What&#x27;s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?&quot;,\n       maxLength: 1000\n   };\n\n   axios.post(url, data, {\n       headers: {\n           &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n           &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n       }\n   })\n   .then(response =&gt; {\n       console.log(&#x27;Response:&#x27;, response.data);\n   })\n   .catch(error =&gt; {\n       console.error(&#x27;Error:&#x27;, error);\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the JavaScript File from PowerShell**:\n   - In PowerShell, navigate to the directory where your JavaScript file is saved.\n   - Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:\n     ```powershell\n     node callAPI.js\n     ```\n\nThis approach lets you make API calls from your computer using JavaScript.\n\n### 2. Using PowerShell Directly for HTTP Requests\nPowerShell has built-in commands for making HTTP requests, like `Invoke-RestMethod` or `Invoke-WebRequest`. Here\u2019s how you can make an API call directly from PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\n# Replace &#x27;YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY&#x27; with your actual key\n$apiKey = &quot;YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY&quot;\n$url = &quot;https://api.theopenapi.com/endpoint&quot;\n$headers = @{\n    &quot;Authorization&quot; = &quot;Bearer $apiKey&quot;\n    &quot;Content-Type&quot; = &quot;application/json&quot;\n}\n\n$body = @{\n    query = &quot;What&#x27;s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?&quot;\n    maxLength = 1000\n} | ConvertTo-Json\n\n$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body\n\n# Output the response\n$response\n```\n\n### Summary\n- **Node.js and NPM Modules**: You can use a JavaScript file with Axios and run it from PowerShell using Node.js.\n- **PowerShell&#x27;s Built-in Tools**: Use `Invoke-RestMethod` to make API calls directly from PowerShell.\n\nLet me know which approach you\u2019d like to go with or if you need more details on either one!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Make sure you use the correct endpoint URL provided by the API you&#x27;re trying to call.\n\n2. **Unexpected Token Error**: The issue in the first line you executed (`$apiKey = &#x27;sk-proj...`) is likely due to an unescaped character or syntax issue.

Make sure to protect your API key and only use it in secure environments.\n\nLet me know if you need more help!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true
