To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

Nonprofit organizations. I. Title.\n\nHD2769.15 .F78 2002\n\n361.7\ufffd63\u2014dc21 2002017227\n\n\n\nPreface Preface\n\nPreface\n\nIn recent years, the study of nonprofit and voluntary organizations has\nbeen a growth field, a fact that is apparent in the proliferation of non-\nprofit degree and certificate programs in schools of business and public\naffairs, the founding of new independent centers devoted to nonprofit\nresearch, and the steady increase in scholarship concerned with non-\nprofit organizations. To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led.

Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

Title.\n\nHD2769.15 .F78 2002\n\n361.7\ufffd63\u2014dc21 2002017227\n\n\n\nPreface Preface\n\nPreface\n\nIn recent years, the study of nonprofit and voluntary organizations has\nbeen a growth field, a fact that is apparent in the proliferation of non-\nprofit degree and certificate programs in schools of business and public\naffairs, the founding of new independent centers devoted to nonprofit\nresearch, and the steady increase in scholarship concerned with non-\nprofit organizations. To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

Nonprofit organizations. I. Title.\n\nHD2769.15 .F78 2002\n\n361.7\ufffd63\u2014dc21 2002017227\n\n\n\nPreface Preface\n\nPreface\n\nIn recent years, the study of nonprofit and voluntary organizations has\nbeen a growth field, a fact that is apparent in the proliferation of non-\nprofit degree and certificate programs in schools of business and public\naffairs, the founding of new independent centers devoted to nonprofit\nresearch, and the steady increase in scholarship concerned with non-\nprofit organizations. To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support.

In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

wrote an article\n00:00:08.029 that featured me in their heroes of\n00:00:12.750 philanthropy edition something is\n00:00:15.839 actually a little uncomfortable with but\n00:00:18.300 you couldn&#x27;t quite stop them I&#x27;d been\n00:00:20.939 working with my family&#x27;s business at the\n00:00:22.769 time and we were in the process of\n00:00:25.710 opening a hotel and at the same time I\n00:00:30.570 had also been involved with various\n00:00:32.159 nonprofits and it actually found out too\n00:00:36.989 that so many of the migrant workers the\n00:00:41.040 men and women who come to Singapore to\n00:00:42.570 clean to build to service Singapore\n00:00:47.190 we&#x27;re actually paying anywhere from six\n00:00:49.890 months even to two years of their\n00:00:52.590 salaries to labor agents that was not\n00:00:57.210 acceptable so my friend Peter and I\n00:01:00.949 thought about trying to create an\n00:01:04.170 alternative system a different way to\n00:01:07.830 recruit people and so we created a new\n00:01:12.540 process that would cap fees that would\n00:01:16.409 tell the people who are coming here\n00:01:18.150 exactly what they were getting for\n00:01:19.680 anything that they were paying and would\n00:01:21.900 actually help prepare them before they\n00:01:23.820 came to manage their expectations and\n00:01:25.799 actually welcome them once they had\n00:01:29.070 arrived it was important to me that we\n00:01:34.259 were able to help them feel at home so\n00:01:38.159 it was a little more effort than usual\n00:01:40.049 maybe but this was a business that I\n00:01:42.509 could influence in a small way for that\n00:01:45.689 for the better and I didn&#x27;t do it to be\n00:01:47.909 a philanthropist I did it because it was\n00:01:50.700 the right thing to do and maybe that&#x27;s\n00:01:53.640 what being a philanthropist is all about\n00:01:57.560 so what do you think of when you hear\n00:02:00.299 the word philanthropist who or what\n00:02:03.960 comes to mind\n00:02:05.600 tech giant wildly crazy entrepreneur\n00:02:12.390 super savvy investor I guess in many of\n00:02:17.680 our minds it&#x27;s sort of the rich and the\n00:02:19.060 powerful who give away millions if not\n00:02:21.310 billions to rid the world of of\n00:02:23.440 preventable diseases from which millions\n00:02:25.750 die every year or maybe rebuilding\n00:02:28.420 cities or maybe creating education and\n00:02:32.769 investing in disenfranchised populations\n00:02:37.500 but what&#x27;s the problem with this picture\n00:02:40.299 I think the biggest challenge is that\n00:02:43.209 philanthropy and the idea of being a\n00:02:45.549 philanthropist is such a far cry from\n00:02:47.680 everybody&#x27;s everyday life day jobs\n00:02:50.680 childcare managing homework but I&#x27;d like\n00:02:55.030 to challenge this idea about how\n00:02:56.859 philanthropy and the loving of humanity\n00:03:00.159 and the exercise of one values to\n00:03:03.400 benefit another is actually something\n00:03:05.560 that can happen every day by anyone\n00:03:08.140 anywhere in small simple personal and\n00:03:13.150 meaningful ways I&#x27;d like to challenge\n00:03:16.180 the idea that the person you&#x27;d least\n00:03:18.579 expect\n00:03:19.299 could be a philanthropist and that the\n00:03:21.940 sum of many small parts has an enormous\n00:03:24.940 impact and that everyone with some skill\n00:03:28.450 or talent can share and that together we\n00:03:33.849 can create a new culture based on these\n00:03:36.370 ideas so how many of you have raised\n00:03:41.410 funds or funded something on a\n00:03:44.319 crowdfunding site okay reasonable\n00:03:49.150 proportion of you there\n00:03:50.400 well a lot of us think of these sites is\n00:03:53.049 actually being very commercially\n00:03:54.400 oriented but did you know that in 2012\n00:03:58.260 the online site that site Kickstarter\n00:04:02.220 actually exceeded the National Endowment\n00:04:04.810 for the Arts in terms of funds\n00:04:06.910 distributed to arts groups in the United\n00:04:09.040 States and as of this year Kickstarter\n00:04:12.910 has raised one and a half billion\n00:04:15.040 dollars for over 80,000 art projects\n00:04:19.149 that gave aspiring artists theatre\n00:04:21.760 practitioners musicians filmmakers and\n00:04:24.370

younger kids the place was completely\n00:05:02.710 spotless everybody&#x27;s toothbrush was\n00:05:05.080 really neatly lined up in the washing\n00:05:06.940 area and then when I asked her who\n00:05:09.340 supports you she told me a church in\n00:05:13.330 Singapore and my two sons and my first\n00:05:17.740 impression was of course that her two\n00:05:19.150 sons were like doctors lawyers or\n00:05:21.010 accountants or something you know maybe\n00:05:23.290 in Yangon or maybe even expats somewhere\n00:05:26.590 else but I asked her and they were\n00:05:29.620 actually expats but one was a security\n00:05:33.940 guard in a shopping mall and the other\n00:05:36.400 one was a construction worker and so\n00:05:40.090 later that week when I came home I\n00:05:42.090 glanced at that Burmese security guard\n00:05:46.150 and I saw him with new eyes could he\n00:05:49.960 have been the philanthropist that funded\n00:05:52.210 Hannah&#x27;s home I imagined them eating\n00:05:55.840 sparingly not spending very much on\n00:05:58.450 personal luxuries and probably saving\n00:06:00.970 50% of their salaries to remit back home\n00:06:04.510 and then I thought you know that&#x27;s\n00:06:08.020 pretty much what Bill Gates and Warren\n00:06:10.330 Buffett decided to do with the Giving\n00:06:12.100 Pledge back at home last year we\n00:06:15.790 actually also undertook this fascinating\n00:06:18.160 experiment we found two brothers Kauai\n00:06:21.430 and kaha aged 9 and 11 and these two\n00:06:25.630 brothers had posted or I guess their\n00:06:27.490 mother had posted on social media that\n00:06:29.080 they were giving away their own Bao\n00:06:31.240 money you know collected during Chinese\n00:06:33.940 Chinese New Year to the Singapore Cancer\n00:06:36.040 Society I guess they had\n00:06:37.550 family related resonance with that with\n00:06:41.480 the cause and these two brothers had\n00:06:44.870 just decided to do that and so we seize\n00:06:47.150 the day and we said hey let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s\n00:06:48.770 share this idea let&#x27;s tell other people\n00:06:51.170 that you know maybe they could do that\n00:06:52.550 too if even if it&#x27;s 1% 5% or 10% you\n00:06:56.630 know of whatever they could they could\n00:06:58.520 make a giveaway from from their own\n00:07:00.170 phone money to support a cause that just\n00:07:02.270 represented something that their family\n00:07:04.640 cared about and the results were\n00:07:07.520 astounding in the first 20 days of\n00:07:10.760 Chinese New Year donations through our\n00:07:13.040 online site were up 73 percent\n00:07:16.970 year-on-year it was a simple fun and\n00:07:20.330 meaningful idea that every everyone\n00:07:22.640 could participate in and it made all the\n00:07:24.650 difference to the nonprofit&#x27;s that they\n00:07:26.600 supported but giving is a lot more than\n00:07:32.030 just money\n00:07:33.020 it&#x27;s time it&#x27;s loving when you&#x27;re it&#x27;s\n00:07:36.650 loving your neighbor\n00:07:37.610 it&#x27;s person-to-person and it&#x27;s the\n00:07:41.030 offering of even if like our skills so a\n00:07:44.330 great a great Singaporean actually is a\n00:07:47.480 photographer Bob Lee some of you may\n00:07:50.120 have may have heard of him or seen him\n00:07:51.800 too and he was asked to teach\n00:07:54.440 photography to the blind he was called\n00:07:58.640 one day by a charity dialogue in the\n00:08:00.320 dark and and and given this intriguing\n00:08:04.040 offer sponsors had come in to help\n00:08:07.040 provide cameras printing services and\n00:08:09.230 space and everything and and Bob began\n00:08:12.830 to teach and one of his students was it\n00:08:17.390 was a gentleman called an elderly\n00:08:18.950 gentleman called uncle William and he\n00:08:20.780 produced his first photograph as you can\n00:08:22.970 see here kind of like cut off legs of\n00:08:26.000 someone and a dustbin and Bob asked him\n00:08:30.110 what&#x27;s what&#x27;s that about William we\n00:08:32.840 didn&#x27;t quite get the composition quite\n00:08:34.880 quite right but Uncle William told him\n00:08:38.390 well actually it&#x27;s about the dustbin and\n00:08:42.340 and Bob said okay well how does that\n00:08:44.870 actually work and he said well you know\n00:08:47.930 every day when I when I take this route\n00:08:50.090 he\n00:08:50.720 no to to go to work I look for that\n00:08:53.449 dustbin because when I hit it it tells\n00:08:55.160 me to turn so that I can cross but one\n00:08:59.509 day this cleaner actually moved the\n00:09:01.189 dustbin and I need him to put it back\n00:09:04.389 and Bob realized that sharing his skill\n00:09:11.439 gave him a view into a whole new world\n00:09:14.170 that he was seeing the world with fresh\n00:09:16.759 eyes and with deeper compassion as a\n00:09:19.370 result so maybe you can take photographs\n00:09:23.060 maybe you can cook maybe you can do\n00:09:26.509 accounts maybe you can write stories or\n00:09:29.180 maybe you&#x27;re just a really good\n00:09:30.410 listening ear how could you use your\n00:09:33.949 skill in service of someone else\n00:09:40.810 my friend Wally uses his company and his\n00:09:45.500 voice he&#x27;s a filmmaker and he raises\n00:09:48.649 awareness or he&#x27;s sought to raise\n00:09:50.209 awareness when he&#x27;s not like making\n00:09:53.120 videos of like wedding or weddings or\n00:09:55.040 doing beautiful food photography that he\n00:09:58.670 decided he was going to do something to\n00:10:00.170 combat this this haze which has kind of\n00:10:01.939 been enveloping you know our our whole\n00:10:04.250 our whole region recently and he decided\n00:10:06.740 that instead of just like moaning about\n00:10:08.959 it like most of us that he was actually\n00:10:11.629 going to crowdfund for masks and for air\n00:10:14.779 quality monitors and he was going to go\n00:10:17.930 with volunteers down to Kalimantan to\n00:10:21.259 distribute them and help educate the\n00:10:23.240 local the local people there and he did\n00:10:27.230 this at a time when of course most of us\n00:10:31.220 were just moaning about a 400 you know\n00:10:35.209 pia PM 2.5 and and he told me that when\n00:10:39.439 he went to Kalimantan the monitors\n00:10:41.959 actually didn&#x27;t work but the year but\n00:10:43.459 the app with the actual PM 2.5 levels\n00:10:46.370 there were actually in excess of 2\n00:10:48.050 million society is made better because\n00:10:51.319 of Wally&#x27;s who share their voice Bob&#x27;s\n00:10:54.259 who share their skill and families like\n00:10:57.350 kaho and kauai who teach the next\n00:11:00.529 generation the values of generosity and\n00:11:03.319 the love for human\n00:11:05.680 society is better because of the two\n00:11:07.880 nameless sons of Hana for practicing\n00:11:11.270 their radical love so my dream is to see\n00:11:15.170 all these parts and pieces connected in\n00:11:17.390 a big Network where skills voices funds\n00:11:22.040 ideas are all shared in one place in our\n00:11:24.890 city and what if we were able to\n00:11:28.370 actually create a marketplace where the\n00:11:30.770 whole city comes together and can we\n00:11:33.080 create for our common good\n00:11:35.680 what if neighbors knew what was needed\n00:11:38.180 and that those needs could be met in a\n00:11:41.330 timely in a timely way with available\n00:11:44.300 resources we all have some margin to\n00:11:48.560 spare and to share we all have influence\n00:11:52.040 and voice and we have friends and\n00:11:54.680 colleagues and family members to reach\n00:11:56.870 out to and I believe that we all have\n00:11:59.660 dreams of being lovers of humanity in a\n00:12:03.740 city of good my colleagues and I are now\n00:12:07.760 imagining and trying to build this\n00:12:09.320 giving platform so we can be Wally&#x27;s\n00:12:11.750 Bob&#x27;s or Hannah&#x27;s children or we can\n00:12:14.330 support them with our voice our skills\n00:12:17.390 or our funds as an expression of our\n00:12:19.460 love and we are well aware that\n00:12:22.130 technology is not the solution but\n00:12:24.980 purely an enabler for philanthropy and\n00:12:27.020 acts of love to be expressed so look\n00:12:31.520 around you I think you&#x27;ll see a\n00:12:34.340 philanthropist waiting to be discovered\n00:12:37.510 thank you\n00:12:46.310 you\n", "title": "tactiq-free-transcript-cJ0gl44Q358.txt", "tether_id":

Answers\n\nStanfordSOCIAL\nINNO VATIONReview\nInforming and inspiring leaders of social change\n\nPhilanthropy&amp; Funding\n\n12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and\nSome Answers\nCritics have argued that charitable giving isn&#x27;t focused enough on the poor, isn&#x27;t sufficient to make a difference,\nis undemocratic, and more, but research\u2014and history\u2014show otherwise.\n\nBy Karl Zinsmeister | May 17, 2016\n\nSince January, I&#x27;ve been traveling around the United States talking to audiences about my new book,\n\nThe  Almanac of American Philanthropy, and how private giving affects our nation. During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings. Consider the the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge,which raised money for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s\nDisease research.The initiative occasioned snickers and sniping from some professional\n\nphilanthropists, but donations it generated led to a major scientific breakthrough at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and pre-funding of clinical trials for new therapies.\n\nThere are many more examples. Crusades against autism by Bernie Marcus,against prostate cancer by\nMichael Milken, and against breast cancer by Nancy Brinker were all thought quixotic when they kicked\n\noff, yet each paid huge dividends. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute, and Markey fellowships would never have seen the light of day if many professionals\n\nhad had their way. And it was support from the Guggenheim family that allowed physicist Robert\nGoddard to overcome scorn from other scientists and ridicule by the New York Times to become the\n\ngenius of rocketry and father of America&#x27;s success in space.\n\nAmerica&#x27;s strong system of decentralized giving and homegrown problem-solving supports wide\n\nexperimentation and avoids putting all of our eggs in one national basket.\n\n5. Philanthropic aid lacks standardization! It&#x27;s a chaotic patchwork!\n\nThe lesson of the Internet is the accumulated power of millions of small actions. The story of today&#x27;s\n\nhacker culture is that one individual with a laptop can do astonishing things.Small-scale action that\nlacks uniformity should not be considered a failing.It&#x27;s not chaos,it&#x27;s crowdsourcing\u2014hordes of\neveryday people taking lots of small bites at a problem and eventually chewing through even very big\nissues.\n\nThere are rich examples of the power of dispersed decision-making throughout biology and across\nhuman history. Many of our most effective charities discovered the power of decentralization\ngenerations ago. Each of the I,4oo local chapters of Habitat for Humanity, for example,are independent\n\n3/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nentities with their own rules, practices, and funding. All of the 164 regional branches of Goodwill have\ntheir own boards of directors, and are autonomous in policy and funding; the central office is tiny\ncompared to working affiliates in cities like Milwaukee and Houston.And the Appalachian Mountain\nClub efficiently maintains thousands of miles of hiking trails through a network of local branches\n\nThis same principle of accomplishing important tasks through loosely coupled teams or networks of\nindependent actors is also a powerful trend in many of today&#x27;s most successful private businesses. Every\n\nUber city in America has different fares,different products, different practices. Philanthropy can be\nproud of having been a pioneer in solving problems via a flexible ecosystem of participants, rather than\n\nby following standardized formulas.\n\n6. Charity may work for individuals, but what we really need are solutions that benefit entire groups!\n\nAmbitious people may look at the \u201cone soul at a time&quot; model prevalent in philanthropy and conclude\nthat it&#x27;s just too slow. But that perspective misunderstands what social reclamation usually requires. For\n\ntough problems like addiction and recidivism, the most successful solutions rely heavily on one-to-one\nhuman accountability. They take advantage of the useful information available when we actually know\n\nsomeone, instead of dealing with a stranger. By creating personal instead of impersonal transactions, we\n\ncan wield the power of relationships to teach and change behavior.\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to romanticize the &quot;consistency&quot; of government programs, and contrast it favorably to the\ncrazy-quilt of individualized variations in charitable aid, but consistency is not really how humans work.\nIf you have one child who needs a very structured environment and another who blooms when left to\n\nnavigate on her own, you don&#x27;t want one-size-fits-all schools; you want individualized services that\nrecognize and work with intimate differences of personality. You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding that in\ngovernment-run programs, but it&#x27;s a hallmark of philanthropic efforts.\n\nBen Franklin was one of the first donors to argue that philanthropy shouldn&#x27;t just transfer funds in an\n\nattempt to relieve men in their misfortune. It should help build up individuals into a healthier state.\n\nThe goal of charitable aid in the United States has always been individual competence and\n\nindependence\u2014not just social quiet. And this often requires a personal touch, real mentoring, and one-\non-one aid of the sort many philanthropic efforts emphasize.\n\n7. Philanthropy is undemocratic!\n\n4/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nSome critics,especially from the left,complain that donors accumulate too much power and that their\nmoney lets them impose their point of view on society. But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year. Measured against the $36o billion of cash that\nAmericans donate annually, and nearly that much more in the value of volunteered time,Gates\nFoundation commands less than I percent of our annual philanthropy. That is not an unhealthy\n\nconcentration of power.\n\nAmerican philanthropy is also diverse and diffuse. Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing. Philanthropy is not\njust a sign of self-rule,but also a source  of it\u2014a kind of nursery for broader loyalties to one&#x27;s fellow\n\ncitizens. A healthy democracy should encourage,not discourage,people from acting on their own to\n\nimprove what they judge to be the common good.\n\n8 .  Only government can lead important social change in a fair way!\n\nHistory tells a different story. Private donors and volunteers created the first schools,missions, colleges,\n\nand apprenticeships for Indians and African Americans,often in the face of state resistance.At the\n\nsame time government was enforcing Jim Crow laws,philanthropist Julius Rosenwald erected 4,977\n\nrural schools across America&#x27;s black belt. At the time of his death, 27 percent of all African American\n\nchildren in the United States were educated in one of the schools he built\n\n5/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThose who view such examples as ancient history and believe that all necessary reforms now flow from\ngovernment are gravely mistaken. According to the UCLA Civil Rights Project, America&#x27;s most\n\nsegregated and often most inadequate government-run schools are all in northern cities with activist\n\ngovernments: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In fact,the country&#x27;s\n\nmost segregated schools are in New York state, thanks to New York City, where the proportion of\n\nschools in which at least go percent of the students are black or Hispanic rose sharply from 1989 to\n2OIO.\n\nIt is private philanthropy that is shaking up New York City&#x27;s complacent educational establishment\ntoday by launching charter schools. There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J. Paul Getty, Leland Stanford,\nRussell Sage, and John MacArthur were known to exhibit shabby behavior. (Stanford, for example,\n\nemployed stock watering, kickbacks,bribery, and collusion.) Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints. Adam Smith taught us that\nfreely conducted commerce can take normal human behaviors\u2014including ugly and mercenary on es -\nand turn them to broadly productive uses.The same is true in the world of philanthropy.Part of the\nmagic of America&#x27;s charitable structure is that it can convert common human impulses into truth,\nuplift, and beauty for all of society.\n\nIo . Philanthropy distracts people who ought to focus on business!\n\nThe right side of the political spectrum sometimes complains that philanthropy drags too many\nproductive business people into do-gooding,distracting them from creating the commercial bounty that\n\n6/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nsociety counts on. But there are reasons to think that philanthropy actually strengthens capitalism.\n\nEconomists Zoltan Acs and Ronnie Phillips have observed that the United States has a distinctive\n\nmeans of \u201creconstituting\u201d wealth via philanthropy.\u201cPhilanthropy is part of the implicit social contract\nthat continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity,&quot; they write. Researchers Tino and Nima\nSanandaji agree that the \u201clegitimacy of American capitalism has in part been upheld through voluntary\ndonations.&quot; They note that &quot;much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to society.\n\nThis has had several feedback effects on capitalism. For one, the practice has limited the rise of new\ndynasties. Another positive feedback mechanism is that the donations to research and higher education\nhave allowed new generations to become wealthy?\n\nII. Philanthropy encourages collective thinking, collective responsibility, and collective action\u2014\nultimately leading to more government!\n\nThis is another concern sometimes launched from the libertarian right, where observers argue that\n\nwhat American society really needs is more individual responsibility, not more giveaways. However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations. Philanthropy has thus been crucial in allowing America to grow up as an exceedingly rare\nsociety where average people can steer their own lives without the state lurking over their shoulder.\n\nI2. Donating money is sometimes too much about the giver&#x27;s needs!\n\nGiving is a two-way transaction,and the satisfactions of helping are just as real and just as good for\nhuman flourishing as the satisfactions of having someone come to your aid.

Porter and Mark R. Kramer\n\nFrom the Magazine (November-December 1999)\n\nDuring the past two decades,the number of charitable\nfoundations in the United States has doubled,while the value of\ntheir assets has increased more than 1,100%.Foundations now\nhold over $330 billion in assets and contribute over $20 billion\nannually to educational, humanitarian,and cultural\norganizations of all kinds. No other country in the world can\nclaim such substantial and widespread commitment to\nphilanthropy and volunteerism. But are we, as a society realizing\nthe full fruits of this commitment?\n\nGrant-giving foundations are intermediaries between the\nindividual donors who fund them and the various social\nenterprises that they, in turn, support. But if foundations serve\nonly as passive middlemen, as mere conduits for giving, then they\nfall far short of their potential and of society&#x27;s high expectations.\n\nFoundations can and should lead social progress. They have the\npotential to make more effective use of scarce resources than\neither individual donors or the government. Free from political\npressures,foundations can explore new solutions to social\nproblems with an independence tha t government can never have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations Create Value in  Four Ways\n\nOne grant\nX\n\nMultiple grants\n3X-5X\n\nEntire operating budget of one organization\n\n50X-100X\n\nEntire field\n\n&gt;1,000X\n\nmillionsDollar value of resources affected by foundation activity\n\nEach successive approach leverages a foundation&#x27;s\n\nspecial assets more than the preceding one as the pool\no f  \u22ef\n\nV\n\n1. Selecting the Best Grantees.\n\nThe process of value creation here is straightforward. Like\ninvestment advisers in the business world,foundations can use\ntheir expertise to channel resources to their most productive uses\nwithin the social sector by funding organizations that are the\nmost cost effective or that address urgent or overlooked problems.\nFor example,of the many organizations that seek funding for\nprograms aimed at reducing the high school dropout rate, a\nfoundation can select the most effective one.Thus its dollar will\n\nearn a higher social return than a dollar given less knowledgeably\nby an individual donor. In this way, choosing recipients and\nallocating funds is itself a source of value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpertise to benefit from the increased tourism. The Packard\nFoundation&#x27;s grant paid for marketing consultants who taught\nCEDO how to turn  tourists  into members, creating an ongoing\nrevenue stream for CEDO far greater than the Foundation&#x27;s\n$50,000 grant.\n\nThe Echoing Green Foundation, created by venture capitalist Ed\nCohen,gives $1.4 million a year to improve the performance of the\nnonprofit sector even more broadly. It invests in social\nentrepreneurs, individuals with the drive and vision to catalyze\nsocial change. It aims to build a community of public-service\nleaders who share their experience, knowledge, and energy with\none another. To date, Echoing Green has funded more than 300\nfellows who not only pursue their own projects but also visit with\none another to share best practices. The lessons learned are\nrecorded, distributed to all grantees,and made publicly available.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, for example, the Charles and Helen Schwab\nFamily Foundation in San Mateo, California, joined with the\nPeninsula Community Foundation and the Sobrato Foundation in\na $2 million,two-year initiative to address internal issues of\nmanagement and growth at 16 local family-service agencies.\nEvery eight weeks for the life of the project, foundation staff\nmembers meet with all 16 agency directors. Management experts\nare brought in to address relevant topics. As a result of the group\ndiscussions, three of the grantees have decided that they ca\n\nThe range of ways in which foundations can assist nonprofits goes\nwell beyond making management-development grants.\nFoundations can become fully engaged partners, providing\nadvice, management assistance,access to professional service\nfirms, clout, and a host of other non-cash resources. Improving\nthe  performance of grant recipients often requires foundations to\nwork closely with grantees. It also requires the willingness to\nengage for the long term. Foundations are capable of both.\n\nn\n\n\n\noperate more efficiently if they merge,and foundation staff has\nworked closely with them to accomplish the merger. Because\ntechnology management has surfaced as a major issue, the\nfoundations have researched and funded technology needs at\nseveral of the agencies.\n\n4 .  Advancing the State of Knowledge and Practice.\n\nFoundations can create the greatest value by funding research\nand a systematic progression of projects that produce more\neffective ways to address social problems.At its best, such work\nresults in a new framework that shapes subsequent work in the\nfield-making every dollar spent by philanthropists, government,\nand other organizations more productive.\n\nWithin six years,India doubled its rice production, and Mexico,\nonce an importer of wheat, became an exporter. Nigeria and\nColombia created  their  own research institutes  modeled  on  the\nfoundations&#x27; research.  The Rockefeller Foundation subsequently\ndisseminated its results to organizations from 28 developing\ncountries. Altogether, many millions of the world&#x27;s poorest people\nbenefited from the knowledge created by those two foundations\n\nFoundations are uniquely positioned to study a field in depth.\nThey can set a new agenda and change both public sentiment and\ngovernment policy. The green revolution, for example, had its\nroots in research sponsored jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller\nFoundations in the late 1950s and early 1960s.Concerned with\nworld hunger and population growth, the two foundations\ncreated research institutes that developed new strains of wheat\nand rice tha t doubled and tripled crop output per acre.\n\n.\n\nStudies by the Carnegie Foundation have had a similarly powerful\nimpact on education in the United States over the last 95 years. In\n1904,Carnegie funded research by Abraham Flexner on the state\nof medical education, which revealed a widespread lack of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the field of education, the Philanthropic Ventures Foundation\nin Oakland, California, for example, focuses on grassroots\nfunding. In 1995, PVF created the Teacher Resource Grants\nprogram. Working within the large field of education, PVF chose a\nspecialized positioning appropriate to its small size. PVF provides\ninexpensive but badly needed classroom materials to teachers in\nits region\u2014materials that are useless if they don&#x27;t arrive quickly,\nwhen the teacher needs them.\n\nPVF notified more than 6,000 teachers that grants of up to $1,500\nwould be available for classroom materials,field trip s, or teacher\ntraining courses.(After a year of experience, PVF lowered the\nceiling to $500 per grant.) Teachers refer to the program as the\n\u201cfax-grant program\u201d because the foundation takes requests by fax,\nand then sends an answer within one hour of receipt and a check\nwithin 24 hours.\n\nSince its positioning is to help under-resourced teachers and it\nmakes thousands of small grants, the Philanthropic Ventures\nFoundation developed a no-paperwork rule, freeing teachers from\ntime-consuming grant applications.PVF finds that an elaborate\nprocess around  the receipt, investigation, consideration, and\n\nfunding of grant requests is not necessary in its chosen area.\n\nPVF is a perfect example of a foundation that tailored its activities\nto create value. Only by doing things differently from others, in a\nway that is linked tightly to what the foundation seeks to\naccomplish, can it achieve greater impact with the same grant\ndollars or enable its grantees to be more successful. Tailoring\nactivities to strategy is the way a foundation institutionalizes and\nreinforces its distinctive strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\ntyranny of the grant cycle, with barely the time to write up\npending grant requests between board meetings.

Fewer than 9% of foundations\n\n\n\nmake 75% or more of their grants in a single field, and only 5%\nfocus more than  90% of their grants in one field. Such scattered\ngiving is inconsistent with a clear strategic positioning.\n\nNor do the data suggest that many foundations are taking\nadvantage of their unique ways to create value. Among the largest\nfoundations,with assets in excess of $1 billion,each professional\nemployee handles approximately seven grants per year (and up to\n100 times as many grant requests). There are, on average, just\nthree professional employees for every field in which the\nfoundation makes grants. Staff at the largest foundations may\nwell have sufficient time and expertise to evaluate grants,but it is\nhard to see how even the most dedicated staff could have much\ntime to assist grantees.  The smaller the foundation, the more\nstretched the staff. Among the hundreds of foundations with $50\nmillion to $250 million in assets, there are five times as many\ngrants per professional,and an average of two staff members\nhandle grants in 11 unrelated fields. The smallest foundations\noften rely on the volunteer efforts of trustees, making it almost\ncertain that many decisions are reached with little formal\nevaluation at all.\n\nThose broad metrics also suggest that foundations are not using\nthe more powerful forms of value creation beyond selection.\nFoundations rarely contribute resources other than financial\nsupport. Only 2.2% of foundation grants were designated to\nimprove the grantees&#x27; performance.Ninety-five percent of all\nfoundation grants are for one year.Although one-year grants are\nsometimes awarded for several years in a row, there is little\nevidence that foundations exploit the opportunity to work more\nclosely with grantees over extended periods of time to improve\ntheir performance. Foundations, which should be able to take the\nlong view tend to focus on grant making quarter-to-quarter.\n\n\n\nFinally, while foundations express a strong interest in innovation\nand advancing the state of knowledge about society&#x27;s problems,\nvery few fund studies that  explore the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent approaches to a given problem. Only 8.8% of foundation\ngrants went to research,and most of that was in basic medical and\nscientific areas. Funding studies or data collection is rare, and\nfoundations generally see them as less desirable than current\nsocial services.\n\nInstead of funding research, many foundations seek to promote\ninnovation through seed grants that are designed to establish and\nsupport specific new programs.There is little benefit, however, in\nstarting new initiatives if they do not survive and grow. Too often\nfoundations overlook projects aimed at fostering the growth and\nreplication of new initiatives, or they fail to support the grantee\nover an appropriately long time span. They rarely do the up-front\nresearch and the postevaluation needed to ascertain if their\nprograms have been successful and have continued to thrive after\nthe initial period of seed grant support.\n\nIn some ways, however, the overall failure to evaluate the results\nof foundation grants is the most telling danger sign of all.Almost\nno money is set aside for program evaluation.Many foundations\nare ambivalent about whether funds should be spent on\nevaluation and whether assessing the performance of past grants\ncan improve future grant making. This ambivalence about\nevaluation is reinforced by the performance criteria used to judge\nfoundation staff. These tend to emphasize the paper trail of\npregrant analysis and recommendations and give little credit for\nachieving the real-world results that motivated the grant in the\nfirst place.Program evaluation,therefore, has only a downside:\nfailure risks censure, but success adds no reward.\n\n\n\nThe evaluations that do take place are often problematic in three\nways. First, they are limited to reports as to whether the money\nwas spent as intended (output evaluation);they do not attempt to\nmeasure social impact (outcome evaluation). Second,many of the\nevaluations are done by the grant recipients themselves, who\ninvariably seek further support from the foundation.How\nobjective and reliable are these reports likely to be? Third,even in\nthe few cases where the social impact of a program is measured by\nan outside consultant, it is usually assessed at the single grantee\nlevel,in isolation from the foundation&#x27;s other grants.Therefore, it\ndoes not reflect the foundation&#x27;s success in reaching its overall\ngoals.\n\nCertainly, evaluation may at times be costly and complex.But\ngiven clear goals at the outset, it is always possible. The criteria to\nevaluate a job-training program will differ from those used to\nevaluate a funding program for young artists. But meaningful\ncriteria can be established for both.\n\nConsider the San Francisco-based Roberts Enterprise\nDevelopment Fund,which focuses on creating employment for\nthe homeless and indigent. Working closely with its grantee\nRubicon Programs, REDF developed 25 criteria that not only\nmeasure the success of job-training programs but also help\nRubicon to manage the programs more effectively. In addition to\nthe most obvious criteria\u2014changes in employment stability\nwages,and job skills\u2014REDF and Rubicon found that related\nfactors such as substance abuse and even qualitative factors such\nas the trainees&#x27; own assessments of their success in reaching\npersonal goals were all meaningful measures of outcomes the\nprogram was trying to achieve.\n\nWithout evaluation, a foundation will never know whether or not\nit has been successful. The most basic premise of strategy-\nstriving for superior performance\u2014is violated if performance is\n\n\n\nnot measured.\n\nAddressing the New Agenda\n\nHow can foundations begin down the path we have outlined? A\nnumber of foundations, including those operating under the new\nrubric of venture philanthropy, are already moving in the\ndirection outlined here. But none that we have encountered has\ngone all the way. Putting these elements together into a coherent\nwhole will require developing a strategy, aligning operations with\nthat strategy, and revising the foundation&#x27;s governance so that the\nstrategy can be monitored effectively. Responsibility for such\nchange lies ultimately with the trustees and directors, who are the\nfiduciaries accountable for the use of the foundation&#x27;s (and\nsociety&#x27;s) funds.\n\nTo develop a strategy  the place to start is positioning. This always\nrequires systematic thought and research into important social\nchallenges that are not being addressed well by others. The goal is\nnot necessarily to identify the most important problem,since\nmany are important.W hat matters is how effectively the\nfou nd at ion  can  co n trib u te  to  its  so lu tion .\n\nSecond, a foundation can learn from prior efforts within its\nchosen area of funding. Do current socioeconomic trends favor\none approach over another? What are other organizations doing\nin  th e  fie ld? Can the  work  of th is  foun da tion  re in fo rce  o r\n\ncomplement theirs? Can we uncover root causes of the problem?\n\nThird,what unique strengths will enable this foundation to create\nvalue most effectively in its field? Part of the answer to this\nquestion comes from examining objectively where the foundation\nhas made the greatest impact in the past. It also comes from a\nre alist ic  assessm e n t  o f w eakne sses.\n\n\n\nScale plays an important role in the choice of strategy. A\nfoundation  needs enough  resources to pursue its particular way of\n\ncreating value.Larger foundations may well have the scale to\nwork in more than one field. If they choose to do so, each area\nmust have its own strategy and tailored operations. All\nfoundations, however, can create more value by putting a greater\nproportion of their resources to work.  This means stepping up the\nrate of giving in their chosen fields and investing a portion of\ntheir  investm ent portfolios to support their  philanthropic work.\n\nOnce the foundation has chosen a strategy, it can begin to realign\nits operations.  A foundation, like any enterprise, is a collection of\nmany activities. Each activity-how  proposals are solicited, for\nexample, and how grantees are supported\u2014must be tailored to\nthe chosen strategy  A particularly important aspect of\noperational alignment is the development of measures to help the\nfoundation know whether or not it has been successful.\n\nOperating strategically will require most foundations to rethink\ntheir governance systems. Change will be difficult in an\nenvironment where the pressure of processing grants and getting\nthe money out the door extends beyond the  staff to the\nboardroom. Today boards of all bu t the very  largest foundations\ndiscuss and approve specific grant allocations at th eir meetings.\nWithout goals or strategy, they have no way to delegate the grant\nselection process to staff and no framework through which to\nevaluate their experience.The Chicago-based Crown Foundation,\nin an effort to break this cycle, considers grant requests at only\ntwo of its quarterly board meetings each year; the other two are\nreserved for discussing policy, reviewing performance, and\nstudying issues in more depth. Boards need to move away from\nthe operating function of approving grants to focus on setting\nstrategy and evaluating outcomes.\n\n\n\nWith goals, a strategy, and evaluation mechanisms in place,staff\ncould have greater independence to make grant decisions\nthemselves on a more timely and flexible basis. At the Colorado\nTrust,the board considers and approves multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar initiatives that have clearly defined goals and a clearly\narticulated strategy  Once the board sets the  framework, program\nstaff has the authority to make individual grants for the life of the\ninitiative. Staff members, then, have greater responsibility and\nmore freedom to make decisions on individual grants, and the\nboard  has the tim e to study  the field, set overall strategies, and\nassess staff performance.\n\nFor those who care deeply about social problems and work\ntirelessly to make a difference, current foundation practices not\nonly diminish effectiveness,they inevitably reduce the\nsatisfaction that donors, staff, and trustees derive from their\nwork. Scattered funding, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with\ngrantees, and a lack of awareness of outcomes necessarily create a\ndivide between the foundation and the ultimate results of its\nwork.Acting strategically is much more difficult. But for trustees\nand staff alike, it will be far more rewarding as well.\n\nImproving the performance of philanthropy would enable\nfoundations to have a much greater impact on society.\nFoundations could play a leading role in changing the culture of\nsocial sector management.They could spearhead the evolution of\nphilanthropy from private acts of conscience into a professional\nfield. Until foundations accept their accountability to society and\nmeet their obligation to create value, they exist in a world where\nthey cannot fail.Unfortunately, they also cannot truly succeed.\nA version of this article appeared in the November-December 1999 issue of\nHarvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nMichael E.

me tell you my briefly my\n00:00:13.759 story um I&#x27;m from Baltimore um my my\n00:00:17.119 last name is Rubenstein and you think if\n00:00:18.920 name like that you might be somebody who\n00:00:20.880 is from a wealthy family their father is\n00:00:22.519 a doctor lawyer but my father um dropped\n00:00:24.960 out of high school to go into World War\n00:00:26.439 II as part of the Marines came back he\n00:00:28.960 met my mother they got married uh\n00:00:30.840 neither graduated from high school my\n00:00:32.279 father worked in the post office his\n00:00:33.600 entire life made about $7,000 at the\n00:00:35.719 peak so I knew if I was going to get\n00:00:37.640 anywhere I probably had to do it on my\n00:00:39.120 own uh in the sixth grade I heard a\n00:00:41.520 speech that was given not far from here\n00:00:43.719 I watched it on television some of you\n00:00:45.160 may be old enough to remember this\n00:00:46.320 speech was given by John Kennedy and he\n00:00:48.559 said in his famous inaugural address\n00:00:50.039 which was only 14 minutes the greatest\n00:00:51.480 inaugural dress I think of the 20th\n00:00:53.000 century he ask not what your country can\n00:00:54.920 do for you but what you can do for your\n00:00:58.039 country and I that speech my teacher\n00:01:00.960 drilled it into our heads and I just\n00:01:02.239 said okay I want to do something for my\n00:01:03.920 country making money meant nothing to me\n00:01:05.720 my parents had no money I didn&#x27;t think\n00:01:07.240 about making money so I said I want to\n00:01:09.040 do something to help my country so\n00:01:10.720 ultimately I decided the way I could do\n00:01:12.080 it was to go to law school and\n00:01:13.840 ultimately work in government and do\n00:01:15.720 something that might help my country if\n00:01:17.759 I did a good job in government so I got\n00:01:19.640 a scholarship to Duke University I got a\n00:01:21.720 scholarship to univ Chicago law school\n00:01:23.600 and then I went to work in a law firm in\n00:01:25.040 New York that a partner at which was the\n00:01:27.600 man who wrote that speech for John\n00:01:29.119 Kennedy his name was Ted s the greatest\n00:01:30.720 presidential speech writer I think of\n00:01:32.079 all time and after a few years of\n00:01:34.240 working for him um he s of hinted maybe\n00:01:37.000 that I wasn&#x27;t such a great lawyer maybe\n00:01:38.479 I should do something different and I\n00:01:40.560 talked to my clients and I said well you\n00:01:42.200 know I might do something different what\n00:01:43.399 do you think they said now&#x27;s a good time\n00:01:44.680 to leave so I got the idea that I\n00:01:46.680 probably wasn&#x27;t a great lawyer and Ted\n00:01:48.640 saon got me an interview with a man he\n00:01:50.600 said we&#x27; be the next president United\n00:01:51.840 States I could work in the White House\n00:01:53.000 just as he had done for President\n00:01:54.079 Kennedy I got a job as the chief counsel\n00:01:56.200 for a man named burby who was running\n00:01:58.680 for president in 1976\n00:02:00.360 30 days after I joined his um Senate\n00:02:02.600 staff he dropped out of his presidential\n00:02:04.039 campaign so I said uhoh maybe this\n00:02:06.000 happened to some to you as well I wasn&#x27;t\n00:02:08.080 a good lawyer my clients didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:09.479 was good my colleagues didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:10.758 was good I went to join a campaign in\n00:02:13.520 effect it it ended after 30 days and\n00:02:15.560 then I got a call out of the blue some\n00:02:16.879 of you may have in your career as well\n00:02:18.560 it said uh would you like to work for\n00:02:20.519 another man running for president who is\n00:02:22.120 this Jimmy Carter and I said well he&#x27;s\n00:02:23.680 the peanut farmer from Georgia and they\n00:02:25.080 said yes he&#x27;s going to be the nominee\n00:02:26.120 for Democratic party in&#x27; 76 I got the\n00:02:28.000 interview I went down to Georgia Carter\n00:02:30.280 was 33 points ahead when I joined his\n00:02:32.000 campaign he won by one point so he he\n00:02:34.840 often said to me you know what did you\n00:02:36.200 really contribute but White House staffs\n00:02:37.680 are not filled on Merit they&#x27;re filled\n00:02:38.879 on who worked in the campaign so I\n00:02:40.519 became the deputy domestic policy\n00:02:42.040 adviser at the president United States\n00:02:43.280 at the age of 27 three years out of law\n00:02:45.200 school I wasn&#x27;t qualified for that job\n00:02:47.080 he wasn&#x27;t qualified for his job so I\n00:02:48.440 figured we fit in\n00:02:50.400 um I managed to get inflation to 19% in\n00:02:53.680 my job very difficult to get inflation\n00:02:55.560 19% nobody&#x27;s done it since um there was\n00:02:58.280 a rumor that I was going to be promoted\n00:02:59.680 in the second term to be the senior\n00:03:01.200 domestic adviser if Carter&#x27;s reelected\n00:03:03.040 and on the strength of that rumor\n00:03:04.080 President Carter thinks he lost the\n00:03:05.239 election so I had to go find a job I\n00:03:07.400 went back and practice law in Washington\n00:03:08.959 it took me many months to convince\n00:03:10.120 somebody I knew how to do something in\n00:03:11.560 practicing law after finding myself\n00:03:13.920 being humiliated because I was a White\n00:03:15.400 House Aid one day next day I couldn&#x27;t\n00:03:16.680 get a job at practicing law finally\n00:03:18.159 somebody felt sorry for me I practiced\n00:03:19.920 law but once again my client said to me\n00:03:21.959 you know this might not be for you and I\n00:03:24.080 said to my my partners what do you think\n00:03:25.920 about this should I stay and they said\n00:03:27.280 maybe not so I decided I would and I\n00:03:30.200 took a chance I read that on average an\n00:03:31.959 entrepreneur starts a company between\n00:03:33.400 the ages of 28 and 37 and I read that\n00:03:35.599 when I was 37 so I said okay I&#x27;m going\n00:03:38.120 to start a company so without knowing\n00:03:39.959 anything about Finance I decided to\n00:03:41.519 start something called the carw group\n00:03:43.640 and I started in Pennsylvania Avenue I\n00:03:45.280 recruited three people actually knew\n00:03:46.480 something about Finance I told them I\n00:03:48.159 had some money but I really was\n00:03:49.280 exaggerating I told him when they showed\n00:03:51.080 up I would get the money so ultimately\n00:03:53.400 uh we start a company with $5 million\n00:03:55.239 today we manage $200 billion and it&#x27;s\n00:03:57.519 turned out to be one of the largest\n00:03:58.480 private Equity firms in the world when I\n00:04:00.239 hit the age of 54 Forbes Magazine put a\n00:04:02.879 story out about my net worth and my\n00:04:04.599 partner&#x27;s net worth and it became\n00:04:05.920 obvious to me that I had made so much\n00:04:07.920 money that I couldn&#x27;t possibly spend it\n00:04:09.599 on on houses and planes and boats and so\n00:04:12.319 forth which I didn&#x27;t really care much\n00:04:13.720 about anyway so I decided what I would\n00:04:15.400 try to do is atone for my sins getting\n00:04:17.399 inflation to 19% and maybe give it back\n00:04:19.759 to the UN government give back to the US\n00:04:21.560 government give back to my country but I\n00:04:23.160 wasn&#x27;t sure how to do it and it came\n00:04:24.520 about in a kind of U unusual way one day\n00:04:27.600 I was invited to an uh an auction in in\n00:04:29.800 New York I was told I would be able to\n00:04:31.360 see the Magna Carta and I said how can\n00:04:33.440 you see the Magna Carta it&#x27;s in England\n00:04:34.720 it turned out there are 17 copies of the\n00:04:36.560 Magna Carta and I had a chance to to see\n00:04:38.960 one of them it was the only one in\n00:04:40.080 private hands I decided that I would try\n00:04:41.919 to buy that and make sure it stayed in\n00:04:43.360 the United States because it was\n00:04:44.280 probably going to be auctioned off I was\n00:04:45.440 told by the auctioneer and leave the\n00:04:47.000 country so I went back that next night I\n00:04:49.039 bought it and I now put it on display at\n00:04:50.880 the National Archives it&#x27;ll be there\n00:04:52.080 permanently and I said I&#x27;ll do this for\n00:04:53.759 the for the country is a way to kind of\n00:04:55.440 make sure this document which was the\n00:04:56.880 inspiration for the Declaration of\n00:04:58.080 Independence the Bill of Rights the\n00:04:59.680 Constitution stays here and then other\n00:05:01.479 documents came available the declaration\n00:05:03.199 independence the Emancipation\n00:05:04.360 Proclamation the 13th Amendment which\n00:05:05.800 Freeds slaves the Constitution the Bill\n00:05:07.720 of Rights and I bought rare copies of\n00:05:09.400 them and put them on display at the\n00:05:10.600 state department the national\n00:05:12.320 Constitution Center the Smithsonian the\n00:05:14.120 library Congress as a way of saying to\n00:05:16.240 Americans take a look at these and learn\n00:05:17.919 more about your history in a recent Pew\n00:05:19.800 survey it turned out that 35% of\n00:05:21.840 Americans when they asked what river did\n00:05:23.160 George washingon cross during the\n00:05:24.440 Revolutionary War said the Rin River not\n00:05:27.039 that&#x27;s not true 33% of Americans when\n00:05:29.479 they asked who was the first treasury\n00:05:30.720 secretary didn&#x27;t know it was Alexander\n00:05:32.479 hamilt and they said it was Larry\n00:05:33.479 Summers so my theory is Americans don&#x27;t\n00:05:35.600 know enough about their history and you\n00:05:36.759 can be a better uh citizen if you know\n00:05:38.759 more about your history so I&#x27;m trying to\n00:05:39.960 buy these historic documents and put\n00:05:41.720 them on display make sure people know\n00:05:43.520 more about history as a way of\n00:05:44.880 introducing them to our history another\n00:05:46.840 thing happened by S tippity as well one\n00:05:48.639 time I was at the keny center and the\n00:05:50.919 man on the board was the head of the\n00:05:52.160 Park Service he told me that Washington\n00:05:53.520 Monument had suffered earthquake damage\n00:05:55.199 I told him I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll put\n00:05:56.639 up the money just ignore the government\n00:05:58.280 and the usual constraints forget\n00:05:59.680 Congress tell me how much it cost I&#x27;ll\n00:06:01.199 put up the money to fix it so he did he\n00:06:02.800 later came back and said Congress wanted\n00:06:04.039 to share the credit because they weren&#x27;t\n00:06:05.560 getting a lot of good credit so they\n00:06:06.560 said can they put up half the money I\n00:06:07.840 said okay so I just put up the money to\n00:06:10.199 repair the Washington Monument some of\n00:06:11.599 you may have seen the scaffolding there\n00:06:12.960 from time to time and then I came up\n00:06:14.520 with the idea that well that was a good\n00:06:15.960 idea but why not fix other historic\n00:06:17.800 things so I decided to help fix up\n00:06:20.000 monachello Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s home mon\n00:06:22.000 peer James Madison&#x27;s home Mount Vernon\n00:06:24.039 George Washington&#x27;s home the custus Lee\n00:06:25.840 Mansion at the top of Arlington and some\n00:06:27.639 other things that I&#x27;ll announce uh down\n00:06:29.120 the road and so what I&#x27;ve decided to do\n00:06:30.680 is to fix these historic buildings in\n00:06:33.000 part because I want to remind Americans\n00:06:34.319 of their history and try to do what I&#x27;m\n00:06:35.960 now called patriotic philanthropy which\n00\nThe file is too long and its contents have been

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power.

But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year.

Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing.

According to the UCLA Civil Rights Project, America&#x27;s most\n\nsegregated and often most inadequate government-run schools are all in northern cities with activist\n\ngovernments: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In fact,the country&#x27;s\n\nmost segregated schools are in New York state, thanks to New York City, where the proportion of\n\nschools in which at least go percent of the students are black or Hispanic rose sharply from 1989 to\n2OIO.\n\nIt is private philanthropy that is shaking up New York City&#x27;s complacent educational establishment\ntoday by launching charter schools. There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J. Paul Getty, Leland Stanford,\nRussell Sage, and John MacArthur were known to exhibit shabby behavior. (Stanford, for example,\n\nemployed stock watering, kickbacks,bribery, and collusion.) Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints. Adam Smith taught us that\nfreely conducted commerce can take normal human behaviors\u2014including ugly and mercenary on es -\nand turn them to broadly productive uses.The same is true in the world of philanthropy.Part of the\nmagic of America&#x27;s charitable structure is that it can convert common human impulses into truth,\nuplift, and beauty for all of society.\n\nIo .

But there are reasons to think that philanthropy actually strengthens capitalism.\n\nEconomists Zoltan Acs and Ronnie Phillips have observed that the United States has a distinctive\n\nmeans of \u201creconstituting\u201d wealth via philanthropy.\u201cPhilanthropy is part of the implicit social contract\nthat continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity,&quot; they write. Researchers Tino and Nima\nSanandaji agree that the \u201clegitimacy of American capitalism has in part been upheld through voluntary\ndonations.&quot; They note that &quot;much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to society.\n\nThis has had several feedback effects on capitalism. For one, the practice has limited the rise of new\ndynasties. Another positive feedback mechanism is that the donations to research and higher education\nhave allowed new generations to become wealthy?\n\nII. Philanthropy encourages collective thinking, collective responsibility, and collective action\u2014\nultimately leading to more government!\n\nThis is another concern sometimes launched from the libertarian right, where observers argue that\n\nwhat American society really needs is more individual responsibility, not more giveaways. However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations. Philanthropy has thus been crucial in allowing America to grow up as an exceedingly rare\nsociety where average people can steer their own lives without the state lurking over their shoulder.\n\nI2. Donating money is sometimes too much about the giver&#x27;s needs!\n\nGiving is a two-way transaction,and the satisfactions of helping are just as real and just as good for\nhuman flourishing as the satisfactions of having someone come to your aid. That&#x27;s why even people\n\n7/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nwith little disposable income are eager to give,and feel good when they do.\n\nSocial science research supports th is.In  a 20o8 paper, three investigators gave study participants\nmoney, and then asked half of them to spend it on themselves, and the other half to give it to some\n\nperson or charity.

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings.

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings. Consider the the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge,which raised money for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s\nDisease research.The initiative occasioned snickers and sniping from some professional\n\nphilanthropists, but donations it generated led to a major scientific breakthrough at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and pre-funding of clinical trials for new therapies.\n\nThere are many more examples. Crusades against autism by Bernie Marcus,against prostate cancer by\nMichael Milken, and against breast cancer by Nancy Brinker were all thought quixotic when they kicked\n\noff, yet each paid huge dividends. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute, and Markey fellowships would never have seen the light of day if many professionals\n\nhad had their way. And it was support from the Guggenheim family that allowed physicist Robert\nGoddard to overcome scorn from other scientists and ridicule by the New York Times to become the\n\ngenius of rocketry and father of America&#x27;s success in space.\n\nAmerica&#x27;s strong system of decentralized giving and homegrown problem-solving supports wide\n\nexperimentation and avoids putting all of our eggs in one national basket.\n\n5. Philanthropic aid lacks standardization! It&#x27;s a chaotic patchwork!\n\nThe lesson of the Internet is the accumulated power of millions of small actions. The story of today&#x27;s\n\nhacker culture is that one individual with a laptop can do astonishing things.Small-scale action that\nlacks uniformity should not be considered a failing.It&#x27;s not chaos,it&#x27;s crowdsourcing\u2014hordes of\neveryday people taking lots of small bites at a problem and eventually chewing through even very big\nissues.\n\nThere are rich examples of the power of dispersed decision-making throughout biology and across\nhuman history. Many of our most effective charities discovered the power of decentralization\ngenerations ago. Each of the I,4oo local chapters of Habitat for Humanity, for example,are independent\n\n3/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nentities with their own rules, practices, and funding. All of the 164 regional branches of Goodwill have\ntheir own boards of directors, and are autonomous in policy and funding; the central office is tiny\ncompared to working affiliates in cities like Milwaukee and Houston.And the Appalachian Mountain\nClub efficiently maintains thousands of miles of hiking trails through a network of local branches\n\nThis same principle of accomplishing important tasks through loosely coupled teams or networks of\nindependent actors is also a powerful trend in many of today&#x27;s most successful private businesses. Every\n\nUber city in America has different fares,different products, different practices. Philanthropy can be\nproud of having been a pioneer in solving problems via a flexible ecosystem of participants, rather than\n\nby following standardized formulas.\n\n6. Charity may work for individuals, but what we really need are solutions that benefit entire groups!\n\nAmbitious people may look at the \u201cone soul at a time&quot; model prevalent in philanthropy and conclude\nthat it&#x27;s just too slow. But that perspective misunderstands what social reclamation usually requires. For\n\ntough problems like addiction and recidivism, the most successful solutions rely heavily on one-to-one\nhuman accountability. They take advantage of the useful information available when we actually know\n\nsomeone, instead of dealing with a stranger. By creating personal instead of impersonal transactions, we\n\ncan wield the power of relationships to teach and change behavior.\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to romanticize the &quot;consistency&quot; of government programs, and contrast it favorably to the\ncrazy-quilt of individualized variations in charitable aid, but consistency is not really how humans work.\nIf you have one child who needs a very structured environment and another who blooms when left to\n\nnavigate on her own, you don&#x27;t want one-size-fits-all schools; you want individualized services that\nrecognize and work with intimate differences of personality. You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding that in\ngovernment-run programs, but it&#x27;s a hallmark of philanthropic efforts.\n\nBen Franklin was one of the first donors to argue that philanthropy shouldn&#x27;t just transfer funds in an\n\nattempt to relieve men in their misfortune. It should help build up individuals into a healthier state.\n\nThe goal of charitable aid in the United States has always been individual competence and\n\nindependence\u2014not just social quiet. And this often requires a personal touch, real mentoring, and one-\non-one aid of the sort many philanthropic efforts emphasize.\n\n7. Philanthropy is undemocratic!\n\n4/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nSome critics,especially from the left,complain that donors accumulate too much power and that their\nmoney lets them impose their point of view on society. But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year. Measured against the $36o billion of cash that\nAmericans donate annually, and nearly that much more in the value of volunteered time,Gates\nFoundation commands less than I percent of our annual philanthropy. That is not an unhealthy\n\nconcentration of power.\n\nAmerican philanthropy is also diverse and diffuse. Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing. Philanthropy is not\njust a sign of self-rule,but also a source  of it\u2014a kind of nursery for broader loyalties to one&#x27;s fellow\n\ncitizens. A healthy democracy should encourage,not discourage,people from acting on their own to\n\nimprove what they judge to be the common good.\n\n8 .  Only government can lead important social change in a fair way!\n\nHistory tells a different story. Private donors and volunteers created the first schools,missions, colleges,\n\nand apprenticeships for Indians and African Americans,often in the face of state resistance.At the\n\nsame time government was enforcing Jim Crow laws,philanthropist Julius Rosenwald erected 4,977\n\nrural schools across America&#x27;s black belt. At the time of his death, 27 percent of all African American\n\nchildren in the United States were educated in one of the schools he built\n\n5/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThose who view such examples as ancient history and believe that all necessary reforms now flow from\ngovernment are gravely mistaken. According to the UCLA Civil Rights Project, America&#x27;s most\n\nsegregated and often most inadequate government-run schools are all in northern cities with activist\n\ngovernments: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In fact,the country&#x27;s\n\nmost segregated schools are in New York state, thanks to New York City, where the proportion of\n\nschools in which at least go percent of the students are black or Hispanic rose sharply from 1989 to\n2OIO.\n\nIt is private philanthropy that is shaking up New York City&#x27;s complacent educational establishment\ntoday by launching charter schools. There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J.

Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints.

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings. Consider the the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge,which raised money for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s\nDisease research.The initiative occasioned snickers and sniping from some professional\n\nphilanthropists, but donations it generated led to a major scientific breakthrough at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and pre-funding of clinical trials for new therapies.\n\nThere are many more examples. Crusades against autism by Bernie Marcus,against prostate cancer by\nMichael Milken, and against breast cancer by Nancy Brinker were all thought quixotic when they kicked\n\noff, yet each paid huge dividends. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute, and Markey fellowships would never have seen the light of day if many professionals\n\nhad had their way. And it was support from the Guggenheim family that allowed physicist Robert\nGoddard to overcome scorn from other scientists and ridicule by the New York Times to become the\n\ngenius of rocketry and father of America&#x27;s success in space.\n\nAmerica&#x27;s strong system of decentralized giving and homegrown problem-solving supports wide\n\nexperimentation and avoids putting all of our eggs in one national basket.\n\n5. Philanthropic aid lacks standardization! It&#x27;s a chaotic patchwork!\n\nThe lesson of the Internet is the accumulated power of millions of small actions. The story of today&#x27;s\n\nhacker culture is that one individual with a laptop can do astonishing things.Small-scale action that\nlacks uniformity should not be considered a failing.It&#x27;s not chaos,it&#x27;s crowdsourcing\u2014hordes of\neveryday people taking lots of small bites at a problem and eventually chewing through even very big\nissues.\n\nThere are rich examples of the power of dispersed decision-making throughout biology and across\nhuman history. Many of our most effective charities discovered the power of decentralization\ngenerations ago. Each of the I,4oo local chapters of Habitat for Humanity, for example,are independent\n\n3/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nentities with their own rules, practices, and funding. All of the 164 regional branches of Goodwill have\ntheir own boards of directors, and are autonomous in policy and funding; the central office is tiny\ncompared to working affiliates in cities like Milwaukee and Houston.And the Appalachian Mountain\nClub efficiently maintains thousands of miles of hiking trails through a network of local branches\n\nThis same principle of accomplishing important tasks through loosely coupled teams or networks of\nindependent actors is also a powerful trend in many of today&#x27;s most successful private businesses. Every\n\nUber city in America has different fares,different products, different practices. Philanthropy can be\nproud of having been a pioneer in solving problems via a flexible ecosystem of participants, rather than\n\nby following standardized formulas.\n\n6. Charity may work for individuals, but what we really need are solutions that benefit entire groups!\n\nAmbitious people may look at the \u201cone soul at a time&quot; model prevalent in philanthropy and conclude\nthat it&#x27;s just too slow. But that perspective misunderstands what social reclamation usually requires. For\n\ntough problems like addiction and recidivism, the most successful solutions rely heavily on one-to-one\nhuman accountability. They take advantage of the useful information available when we actually know\n\nsomeone, instead of dealing with a stranger. By creating personal instead of impersonal transactions, we\n\ncan wield the power of relationships to teach and change behavior.\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to romanticize the &quot;consistency&quot; of government programs, and contrast it favorably to the\ncrazy-quilt of individualized variations in charitable aid, but consistency is not really how humans work.\nIf you have one child who needs a very structured environment and another who blooms when left to\n\nnavigate on her own, you don&#x27;t want one-size-fits-all schools; you want individualized services that\nrecognize and work with intimate differences of personality. You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding that in\ngovernment-run programs, but it&#x27;s a hallmark of philanthropic efforts.\n\nBen Franklin was one of the first donors to argue that philanthropy shouldn&#x27;t just transfer funds in an\n\nattempt to relieve men in their misfortune. It should help build up individuals into a healthier state.\n\nThe goal of charitable aid in the United States has always been individual competence and\n\nindependence\u2014not just social quiet. And this often requires a personal touch, real mentoring, and one-\non-one aid of the sort many philanthropic efforts emphasize.\n\n7. Philanthropy is undemocratic!\n\n4/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nSome critics,especially from the left,complain that donors accumulate too much power and that their\nmoney lets them impose their point of view on society. But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year. Measured against the $36o billion of cash that\nAmericans donate annually, and nearly that much more in the value of volunteered time,Gates\nFoundation commands less than I percent of our annual philanthropy. That is not an unhealthy\n\nconcentration of power.\n\nAmerican philanthropy is also diverse and diffuse. Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing. Philanthropy is not\njust a sign of self-rule,but also a source  of it\u2014a kind of nursery for broader loyalties to one&#x27;s fellow\n\ncitizens. A healthy democracy should encourage,not discourage,people from acting on their own to\n\nimprove what they judge to be the common good.\n\n8 .  Only government can lead important social change in a fair way!\n\nHistory tells a different story. Private donors and volunteers created the first schools,missions, colleges,\n\nand apprenticeships for Indians and African Americans,often in the face of state resistance.At the\n\nsame time government was enforcing Jim Crow laws,philanthropist Julius Rosenwald erected 4,977\n\nrural schools across America&#x27;s black belt. At the time of his death, 27 percent of all African American\n\nchildren in the United States were educated in one of the schools he built\n\n5/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThose who view such examples as ancient history and believe that all necessary reforms now flow from\ngovernment are gravely mistaken. According to the UCLA Civil Rights Project, America&#x27;s most\n\nsegregated and often most inadequate government-run schools are all in northern cities with activist\n\ngovernments: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In fact,the country&#x27;s\n\nmost segregated schools are in New York state, thanks to New York City, where the proportion of\n\nschools in which at least go percent of the students are black or Hispanic rose sharply from 1989 to\n2OIO.\n\nIt is private philanthropy that is shaking up New York City&#x27;s complacent educational establishment\ntoday by launching charter schools. There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J. Paul Getty, Leland Stanford,\nRussell Sage, and John MacArthur were known to exhibit shabby behavior. (Stanford, for example,\n\nemployed stock watering, kickbacks,bribery, and collusion.) Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints. Adam Smith taught us that\nfreely conducted commerce can take normal human behaviors\u2014including ugly and mercenary on es -\nand turn them to broadly productive uses.The same is true in the world of philanthropy.Part of the\nmagic of America&#x27;s charitable structure is that it can convert common human impulses into truth,\nuplift, and beauty for all of society.\n\nIo . Philanthropy distracts people who ought to focus on business!\n\nThe right side of the political spectrum sometimes complains that philanthropy drags too many\nproductive business people into do-gooding,distracting them from creating the commercial bounty that\n\n6/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nsociety counts on. But there are reasons to think that philanthropy actually strengthens capitalism.\n\nEconomists Zoltan Acs and Ronnie Phillips have observed that the United States has a distinctive\n\nmeans of \u201creconstituting\u201d wealth via philanthropy.\u201cPhilanthropy is part of the implicit social contract\nthat continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity,&quot; they write. Researchers Tino and Nima\nSanandaji agree that the \u201clegitimacy of American capitalism has in part been upheld through voluntary\ndonations.&quot; They note that &quot;much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to society.\n\nThis has had several feedback effects on capitalism. For one, the practice has limited the rise of new\ndynasties. Another positive feedback mechanism is that the donations to research and higher education\nhave allowed new generations to become wealthy?\n\nII. Philanthropy encourages collective thinking, collective responsibility, and collective action\u2014\nultimately leading to more government!\n\nThis is another concern sometimes launched from the libertarian right, where observers argue that\n\nwhat American society really needs is more individual responsibility, not more giveaways. However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations. Philanthropy has thus been crucial in allowing America to grow up as an exceedingly rare\nsociety where average people can steer their own lives without the state lurking over their shoulder.\n\nI2. Donating money is sometimes too much about the giver&#x27;s needs!\n\nGiving is a two-way transaction,and the satisfactions of helping are just as real and just as good for\nhuman flourishing as the satisfactions of having someone come to your aid. That&#x27;s why even people\n\n7/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nwith little disposable income are eager to give,and feel good when they do.\n\nSocial science research supports th is.In  a 20o8 paper, three investigators gave study participants\nmoney, and then asked half of them to spend it on themselves, and the other half to give it to some\n\nperson or charity.

Fundraising primarily involves collecting monetary support, usually with a focus on immediate financial targets and often driven by specific events or campaigns. On the other hand, development encompasses a broader scope. It includes fundraising but extends to nurturing long-term relationships with donors, strategic resource planning, and fostering a philanthropic culture within and around the organization (Frumpkin, 2005).\nThe strategic nature of development plans is a key factor in bolstering fundraising efforts. These plans are not solely focused on acquiring funds, but also on retaining and engaging donors over the long term. They involve understanding the motivations of donors, aligning these motivations with the organization&#x27;s goals, and creating meaningful engagement opportunities.

First, I would engage the community as active participants in decision-making and planning ensuring that development activities resonate deeply with community needs and values.  I would ensure transparency about how funds are used to fortify trust and deepen donor relationships. Lastly, I would ensure diverse funding sources by exploring revenue streams beyond traditional donations\u2014like social enterprises or membership programs\u2014enhancing financial stability and ensuring alignment with the organization\u2019s mission.

We believe that an individual&#x27;s happiness is not just a personal achievement but a societal asset. A content person is a beacon of positivity capable of enriching their community. When we collectively strive for happiness we also invest in our well-being and foster a society free from the shackles of discontent. These ideas reflect our vision where individual happiness is the cornerstone of societal harmony.\nAs the renowned author John Donne (2010)  famously proclaimed \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d This sentiment holds true in our pursuit of societal greatness. Achieving this requires unity and collaboration. However when an individual is grappling with internal conflicts such as mental health struggles physical ailments and a general decline in well-being overcoming these challenges alone becomes an insurmountable task. Wellness is not just a personal concern but a societal issue that impacts us all.\nIn addition to discussing wellness it is necessary also to address the role of education. If wellness is the foundation education is the next step where individuals acquire the necessary skills to lead purposeful dignified and joyful lives. Nobody is inherently equipped with the knowledge to improve their surroundings; it must be learned. Therefore education holds equal significance in the pursuit of wellness. As one begins to grasp the world&#x27;s order concepts like the principles of space and time the philosophies of Aristotle the mathematics of our universe and the evocative poetry of Yates one starts to perceive the world in a new nuanced way. Therefore to truly understand oneself it is sometimes necessary to first understand one&#x27;s environment. Thus in parallel with well-being education holds great importance.\nAs individuals gain knowledge about the world around them they instinctively desire to explore it further engaging with it through the senses of touch taste and sight. Rather than solely studying Mozart and reading musical notations experiencing the music in person is essential. Therefore travel is an invaluable gateway to becoming a well-rounded individual capable of positively contributing to society.\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to creating a better world. By leveraging the support of donor investors the foundation aims to empower individuals to pursue their own happiness by providing necessary tools. Our efforts involve establishing partnerships with local government bodies and healthcare providers to ensure easy access to government services and healthcare and make travel accessible to all who desire it. These initiatives will lay the foundation for our long-term vision of a globally interconnected and joyful society.\nPurpose\nThe primary purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally through increased access to essential life-enhancing services. The Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to providing the necessary tools for individuals to pursue their happiness. Our starting point is ensuring access to healthcare and mental health services as a fundamental human right and a crucial component in our efforts to build a better world. We also aim to utilize well-being travel cultural immersion and education resources to empower individuals to gain self-awareness understand others and collectively achieve holistic happiness.\nGoals\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to enhancing the global quality of life through two strategic goals.\n\nLong-term Goal: Increase Access to Key Well-being Services\nOur long-term goal is to significantly increase access to key well-being services globally with our efforts first being localized in the United States and Italy. By doing so we aim to improve the quality of life and foster sustained happiness in diverse communities. This goal will not only benefit the communities we serve but also provide donor-investors with the satisfaction of knowing that their support is making a tangible difference in people&#x27;s lives. The impact of these programs will be measured by tracking the number of individuals accessing these services the improvement in health and education outcomes and overall satisfaction rates among participants reflecting the direct benefits of our initiatives.\nShort-term Goal: Establish and Strengthen Partnerships\nPartnerships are at the heart of our strategy. Our short-term goal is to establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international public and private organizations. These partnerships are not just beneficial; they are crucial for enhancing our capability to deliver critical services effectively and efficiently. By collaborating with organizations with established infrastructures and expertise in our target regions we can leverage their strengths to better serve the communities&#x27; needs. Formalizing at least five significant partnerships within the first six months will be vital to achieving this goal.\nBoth goals complement existing efforts in the target communities rather than duplicate them ensuring that our interventions add value and create a measurable impact. Through these focused efforts the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation seeks to build a foundation for long-term social change that contributes to the well-being of individuals worldwide.\n\nObjectives\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) has set ambitious yet achievable objectives to ensure a broad and lasting impact on global well-being.\nEducational Expansion\nOur first objective focuses on education expansion. Within the first year GHIF plans to launch educational programs in at least two countries aiming to reach over 5000 individuals. These programs will be developed to address local educational gaps better equip youths with functional skills  and promote holistic learning experiences. Evidence shows that educational programs can significantly enhance psychological well-being by increasing self-efficacy social support and overall life satisfaction (Ross &amp; Willigen 1997). Moreover education has been linked to improved health outcomes and better mental health with increased years of education correlating with lower rates of depression and anxiety (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder 2022). The success of these programs will be measured by the number of programs successfully launched the total number of participants enrolled and participant feedback on program effectiveness.\nHealthcare Partnerships\nSimultaneously GHIF aims to establish healthcare partnerships to enhance access to medical and mental health services. By the end of the first six months we will secure partnerships with at least five major healthcare providers. These collaborations will focus on providing comprehensive health services emphasizing preventive care and mental health which are crucial for improving individual well-being. Studies have shown that partnerships between educational institutions and healthcare providers can significantly improve health outcomes particularly in preventive care and mental health services (Ross &amp; Wu 1995). The effectiveness of these partnerships will be assessed through the number of agreements signed the range of services provided and feedback from service users regarding the accessibility and quality of care.\nWellness Travel Model\nLastly our third objective is to develop a wellness travel model which will be designed developed and ready for implementation within the first eighteen months. This model will provide frameworks for wellness-oriented travel experiences promoting mental and physical health benefits through carefully crafted travel packages. Wellness programs embedded in educational and travel contexts have shown positive impacts on well-being reducing stress and improving mental health (Young et al. 2020). The model\u2019s success will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction measured through surveys and the repeat engagement rate indicating the model&#x27;s appeal and effectiveness in enhancing participants&#x27; well-being.\nOrganizational Capacity\nFoundation Structure and Management Capability:\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is designed to be a robust organization capable of managing large-scale projects and substantial grants. At its inception GHIF will establish a governance structure with a board of directors comprising education healthcare mental health and non-profit management experts. This board will provide strategic oversight and ensure all activities align with our mission and objectives.\nFounding Team Expertise:\nThe founding team of GHIF will include highly qualified professionals selected for their extensive experience in project management international development healthcare and educational programming. Our recruitment strategy focuses on identifying individuals with a proven track record such as a Project Director with significant experience in managing and scaling community health programs an Education Specialist renowned for developing effective curricula in diverse cultural settings and a Mental Health Advocate with a strong background in leading global mental wellness initiatives. This planned assembly of expertise ensures a comprehensive and skilled approach to achieving the foundation\u2019s objectives.\nProject Management Systems:\nGHIF will implement rigorous project management methodologies to oversee all foundation activities. We will utilize established frameworks such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guidelines to plan execute monitor and close projects. Additionally GHIF will adopt modern project management tools for real-time tracking and reporting facilitating transparent and efficient management of the grant funds.\nPreparatory Actions for Grant Management:\nPrior to receiving the grant GHIF will:\nFormulate detailed project plans including timelines budgets and resource allocation.\nEstablish financial management policies tailored to ensure accountability and prudent use of funds.\nInitiate discussions with potential partners and stakeholders to build a support network for immediate project launch upon funding.\nDemonstrating Capacity through Strategic Intentions:\nWhile GHIF is a nascent organization our strategic planning reflects a clear and actionable roadmap for immediate impact upon funding. The foundation\u2019s goals are backed by a commitment to leverage the diverse skills of its team and the strategic insights of its board to establish a high-performing organization. GHIF&#x27;s initial actions and detailed project preparations demonstrate our readiness and capability to effectively manage and utilize the grant to achieve significant social impact.\nCross-Sector Collaboration \nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to developing localized high-impact programs that serve as models for global implementation. To achieve this GHIF emphasizes cross-sector collaboration mainly focusing on strategic partnerships in Italy and the United States. These collaborations are designed to leverage regional strengths and address specific local needs ensuring the adaptability and effectiveness of our well-being services.\nLocalized Educational Partnerships\nGHIF will collaborate with leading educational institutions in Italy and the United States to integrate well-being practices into educational curricula. This initiative will focus on regions with significant disparities in educational outcomes providing targeted interventions that are culturally and contextually relevant. Research indicates that collaborative learning environments and educational partnerships can significantly enhance student outcomes and well-being (Kilgo et al. 2015). Success in these partnerships will be evaluated based on academic improvements student well-being metrics and the scalability of the programs to other regions.\nHealthcare Alliances\nGHIF plans to partner with healthcare organizations in Italy and the United States to increase access to quality health services. These partnerships will focus on integrating mental health services with primary care a critical need in both countries according to local health reports. Studies have shown cross-sector healthcare collaborations can improve health outcomes particularly when mental health services are integrated with primary care (Randall et al. 2023). By working with local health providers and community organizations these initiatives aim to create sustainable health improvement models suitable for global replication.\nPublic-Private Partnerships\nGHIF will seek partnerships with local government bodies and private sectors in Italy and the United States to support infrastructure development vital to program delivery. These partnerships will help facilitate the creation of community wellness centers which will serve as hubs for education healthcare and community activities. Effective public-private partnerships have been shown to significantly enhance community health and well-being (Ovseiko et al. 2014). The effectiveness of these centers will be measured through community engagement rates and the overall improvement in community health and educational outcomes.\nCommunity Engagement\nIntegral to our strategy is the direct involvement of local communities in Italy and the United States in the planning and implementation phases. GHIF believes that community input is essential to tailoring programs that genuinely reflect and meet local needs. Feedback mechanisms and community advisory boards will be established to monitor the programs\u2019 impacts and guide iterative improvements as evidence proves that community involvement is crucial for the success and sustainability of public health programs (Mattessich &amp; Rausch 2014).\nProgram Plan\nIntroduction to Program Strategy\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to addressing critical needs in communities across the United States and Italy. We implement multifaceted strategies that enhance individual well-being and community health specifically designed to complement rather than duplicate existing services. Our comprehensive approach leverages local strengths and targets specific challenges through innovative and sustainable solutions.\nIntegration with Government and Healthcare Services\nOur initiative targets significant gaps in access to healthcare and government support services. These gaps have been identified through extensive community outreach and stakeholder engagement underscoring a pressing need for improved service accessibility and quality. To address these challenges GHIF plans to forge strategic alliances with local health departments and social service agencies creating a referral network that simplifies the process for individuals to access the services they need. This network aims to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of health and social care systems.\nPartnership development is crucial for the success of our healthcare integration strategy. By collaborating with local health authorities and service providers we aim to establish robust partnerships that facilitate streamlined access to healthcare and support services. These partnerships will be foundational in building a comprehensive referral system that enhances service delivery and meets the specific needs of the communities we serve.\nIn addition to building partnerships GHIF will engage in advocacy and policy work to enhance healthcare delivery. We will work closely with policymakers to advocate for regulations and policies prioritizing the health and well-being of underrepresented communities. Our focus on advocacy aims to influence policy changes that improve healthcare accessibility and address systemic barriers in service delivery.\nTraining community health workers is another critical component of our strategy. GHIF will implement comprehensive training programs designed to enhance the capabilities of health workers in assisting individuals effectively. These programs will focus on developing empathy technical skills and a deep understanding of the healthcare system. This will ensure that community health workers are well-equipped to support individuals in navigating health and social services.\nWellness Travel Model\nGHIF recognizes the therapeutic potential of travel in promoting mental and physical well-being. To harness this potential we are developing a Wellness Travel Model that integrates health benefits with cultural and educational experiences. This innovative approach to wellness extends beyond traditional health settings and includes travel packages that feature guided meditations wellness workshops and cultural tours. Each package is designed in collaboration with travel experts and cultural institutions to ensure that it offers genuine health benefits and facilitates cultural appreciation.\nCommunity-based involvement is integral to the design and execution of our Wellness Travel Model. We engage local communities in developing travel experiences to ensure they are culturally respectful and enriching for visitors and hosts. This engagement helps create authentic travel experiences sensitive to the host communities&#x27; cultural dynamics and provides meaningful interactions that benefit all participants.\nHolistic Educational Access\nGHIF is also dedicated to transforming educational access by integrating a curriculum that includes advanced technology training and comprehensive arts education. This holistic approach aims to bridge the gap in technological and creative skills preparing individuals for the demands of the modern workforce and personal development. Our curriculum includes coding robotics visual arts and music training and is designed to be integrated into school systems and community learning centers.\nGHIF will establish ongoing learning opportunities through workshops and seminars open to all age groups to complement our formal education initiatives. These initiatives focus on continuous skill development and personal growth promoting lifelong learning and adaptability. By offering workshops and seminars that cover a range of skills and artistic disciplines we aim to foster an environment of continuous learning and creative exploration.\nTimeline and Evaluation\nThe timeline for these initiatives is strategically set to ensure a phased implementation. By the end of the second quarter of 2025 GHIF will establish the initial partnerships necessary for the referral systems and develop training programs for community health workers. Following the establishment of partnerships early in the same year the Wellness Travel Packages are expected to be launched by the third quarter of 2025. Educational program rollouts will begin in the fourth quarter of 2024 and be fully implemented across targeted regions by the second quarter of 2025.\nEach element of the program plan is designed to measure specific outcomes related to access satisfaction and educational attainment ensuring that GHIF&#x27;s interventions create measurable and sustainable impacts in the communities served. This strategic planning demonstrates GHIF&#x27;s capability to manage a large grant effectively and fulfill its mission of building a foundation for long-term social change that contributes significantly to global well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\t\nDeliverables\t\nActivities\t\nDue Date\t\nExpected Challenges\n\t\nSet up Referral Systems\t\nEstablish partnerships develop training for staff\t\nQ2 2025\t\nRegulatory hurdles securing partner cooperation\n\t\nLaunch Wellness Travel Packages\t\nDesign packages negotiate with travel agencies\t\nQ3 2025\t\nLogistics coordination ensuring accessibility and inclusion\n\t\nRollout Educational Programs\t\nDevelop curricula and integrate into schools\t\nQ4 2025\t\nAdaptation to local educational standards funding\n\t\nPublic Workshops and Seminars\t\nPlan and implement workshops and lifelong learning seminars\t\nQ1 2026\t\nCommunity engagement sustaining interest over time\n\n\nReferences\nCunningham W.

https://www.youtube.com/watch/cJ0gl44Q358\n\n00:00:03.200 in 2009 Forbes magazine wrote an article\n00:00:08.029 that featured me in their heroes of\n00:00:12.750 philanthropy edition something is\n00:00:15.839 actually a little uncomfortable with but\n00:00:18.300 you couldn&#x27;t quite stop them I&#x27;d been\n00:00:20.939 working with my family&#x27;s business at the\n00:00:22.769 time and we were in the process of\n00:00:25.710 opening a hotel and at the same time I\n00:00:30.570 had also been involved with various\n00:00:32.159 nonprofits and it actually found out too\n00:00:36.989 that so many of the migrant workers the\n00:00:41.040 men and women who come to Singapore to\n00:00:42.570 clean to build to service Singapore\n00:00:47.190 we&#x27;re actually paying anywhere from six\n00:00:49.890 months even to two years of their\n00:00:52.590 salaries to labor agents that was not\n00:00:57.210 acceptable so my friend Peter and I\n00:01:00.949 thought about trying to create an\n00:01:04.170 alternative system a different way to\n00:01:07.830 recruit people and so we created a new\n00:01:12.540 process that would cap fees that would\n00:01:16.409 tell the people who are coming here\n00:01:18.150 exactly what they were getting for\n00:01:19.680 anything that they were paying and would\n00:01:21.900 actually help prepare them before they\n00:01:23.820 came to manage their expectations and\n00:01:25.799 actually welcome them once they had\n00:01:29.070 arrived it was important to me that we\n00:01:34.259 were able to help them feel at home so\n00:01:38.159 it was a little more effort than usual\n00:01:40.049 maybe but this was a business that I\n00:01:42.509 could influence in a small way for that\n00:01:45.689 for the better and I didn&#x27;t do it to be\n00:01:47.909 a philanthropist I did it because it was\n00:01:50.700 the right thing to do and maybe that&#x27;s\n00:01:53.640 what being a philanthropist is all about\n00:01:57.560 so what do you think of when you hear\n00:02:00.299 the word philanthropist who or what\n00:02:03.960 comes to mind\n00:02:05.600 tech giant wildly crazy entrepreneur\n00:02:12.390 super savvy investor I guess in many of\n00:02:17.680 our minds it&#x27;s sort of the rich and the\n00:02:19.060 powerful who give away millions if not\n00:02:21.310 billions to rid the world of of\n00:02:23.440 preventable diseases from which millions\n00:02:25.750 die every year or maybe rebuilding\n00:02:28.420 cities or maybe creating education and\n00:02:32.769 investing in disenfranchised populations\n00:02:37.500 but what&#x27;s the problem with this picture\n00:02:40.299 I think the biggest challenge is that\n00:02:43.209 philanthropy and the idea of being a\n00:02:45.549 philanthropist is such a far cry from\n00:02:47.680 everybody&#x27;s everyday life day jobs\n00:02:50.680 childcare managing homework but I&#x27;d like\n00:02:55.030 to challenge this idea about how\n00:02:56.859 philanthropy and the loving of humanity\n00:03:00.159 and the exercise of one values to\n00:03:03.400 benefit another is actually something\n00:03:05.560 that can happen every day by anyone\n00:03:08.140 anywhere in small simple personal and\n00:03:13.150 meaningful ways I&#x27;d like to challenge\n00:03:16.180 the idea that the person you&#x27;d least\n00:03:18.579 expect\n00:03:19.299 could be a philanthropist and that the\n00:03:21.940 sum of many small parts has an enormous\n00:03:24.940 impact and that everyone with some skill\n00:03:28.450 or talent can share and that together we\n00:03:33.849 can create a new culture based on these\n00:03:36.370 ideas so how many of you have raised\n00:03:41.410 funds or funded something on a\n00:03:44.319 crowdfunding site okay reasonable\n00:03:49.150 proportion of you there\n00:03:50.400 well a lot of us think of these sites is\n00:03:53.049 actually being very commercially\n00:03:54.400 oriented but did you know that in 2012\n00:03:58.260 the online site that site Kickstarter\n00:04:02.220 actually exceeded the National Endowment\n00:04:04.810 for the Arts in terms of funds\n00:04:06.910 distributed to arts groups in the United\n00:04:09.040 States and as of this year Kickstarter\n00:04:12.910 has raised one and a half billion\n00:04:15.040 dollars for over 80,000 art projects\n00:04:19.149 that gave aspiring artists theatre\n00:04:21.760 practitioners musicians filmmakers and\n00:04:24.370 the\n00:04:24.970 a chance to realize their dreams with an\n00:04:27.940 average contribution of $25 perhaps\n00:04:35.920 though less obvious are hidden heroes\n00:04:39.010 whose life choices can really inspire us\n00:04:41.610 a couple years ago I vetted I visited\n00:04:44.920 Myanmar and I met this woman Hana so she\n00:04:49.450 was living about an hour and a half\n00:04:50.710 outside of Yangon and she ran an\n00:04:52.600 orphanage with 19 children from the ages\n00:04:54.730 of like 3 months all the way up to 2 18\n00:04:58.270 years old the older kids helped the\n00:05:01.120 younger kids the place was completely\n00:05:02.710 spotless everybody&#x27;s toothbrush was\n00:05:05.080 really neatly lined up in the washing\n00:05:06.940 area and then when I asked her who\n00:05:09.340 supports you she told me a church in\n00:05:13.330 Singapore and my two sons and my first\n00:05:17.740 impression was of course that her two\n00:05:19.150 sons were like doctors lawyers or\n00:05:21.010 accountants or something you know maybe\n00:05:23.290 in Yangon or maybe even expats somewhere\n00:05:26.590 else but I asked her and they were\n00:05:29.620 actually expats but one was a security\n00:05:33.940 guard in a shopping mall and the other\n00:05:36.400 one was a construction worker and so\n00:05:40.090 later that week when I came home I\n00:05:42.090 glanced at that Burmese security guard\n00:05:46.150 and I saw him with new eyes could he\n00:05:49.960 have been the philanthropist that funded\n00:05:52.210 Hannah&#x27;s home I imagined them eating\n00:05:55.840 sparingly not spending very much on\n00:05:58.450 personal luxuries and probably saving\n00:06:00.970 50% of their salaries to remit back home\n00:06:04.510 and then I thought you know that&#x27;s\n00:06:08.020 pretty much what Bill Gates and Warren\n00:06:10.330 Buffett decided to do with the Giving\n00:06:12.100 Pledge back at home last year we\n00:06:15.790 actually also undertook this fascinating\n00:06:18.160 experiment we found two brothers Kauai\n00:06:21.430 and kaha aged 9 and 11 and these two\n00:06:25.630 brothers had posted or I guess their\n00:06:27.490 mother had posted on social media that\n00:06:29.080 they were giving away their own Bao\n00:06:31.240 money you know collected during Chinese\n00:06:33.940 Chinese New Year to the Singapore Cancer\n00:06:36.040 Society I guess they had\n00:06:37.550 family related resonance with that with\n00:06:41.480 the cause and these two brothers had\n00:06:44.870 just decided to do that and so we seize\n00:06:47.150 the day and we said hey let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s\n00:06:48.770 share this idea let&#x27;s tell other people\n00:06:51.170 that you know maybe they could do that\n00:06:52.550 too if even if it&#x27;s 1% 5% or 10% you\n00:06:56.630 know of whatever they could they could\n00:06:58.520 make a giveaway from from their own\n00:07:00.170 phone money to support a cause that just\n00:07:02.270 represented something that their family\n00:07:04.640 cared about and the results were\n00:07:07.520 astounding in the first 20 days of\n00:07:10.760 Chinese New Year donations through our\n00:07:13.040 online site were up 73 percent\n00:07:16.970 year-on-year it was a simple fun and\n00:07:20.330 meaningful idea that every everyone\n00:07:22.640 could participate in and it made all the\n00:07:24.650 difference to the nonprofit&#x27;s that they\n00:07:26.600 supported but giving is a lot more than\n00:07:32.030 just money\n00:07:33.020 it&#x27;s time it&#x27;s loving when you&#x27;re it&#x27;s\n00:07:36.650 loving your neighbor\n00:07:37.610 it&#x27;s person-to-person and it&#x27;s the\n00:07:41.030 offering of even if like our skills so a\n00:07:44.330 great a great Singaporean actually is a\n00:07:47.480 photographer Bob Lee some of you may\n00:07:50.120 have may have heard of him or seen him\n00:07:51.800 too and he was asked to teach\n00:07:54.440 photography to the blind he was called\n00:07:58.640 one day by a charity dialogue in the\n00:08:00.320 dark and and and given this intriguing\n00:08:04.040 offer sponsors had come in to help\n00:08:07.040 provide cameras printing services and\n00:08:09.230 space and everything and and Bob began\n00:08:12.830 to teach and one of his students was it\n00:08:17.390 was a gentleman called an elderly\n00:08:18.950 gentleman called uncle William and he\n00:08:20.780 produced his first photograph as you can\n00:08:22.970 see here kind of like cut off legs of\n00:08:26.000 someone and a dustbin and Bob asked him\n00:08:30.110 what&#x27;s what&#x27;s that about William we\n00:08:32.840 didn&#x27;t quite get the composition quite\n00:08:34.880 quite right but Uncle William told him\n00:08:38.390 well actually it&#x27;s about the dustbin and\n00:08:42.340 and Bob said okay well how does that\n00:08:44.870 actually work and he said well you know\n00:08:47.930 every day when I when I take this route\n00:08:50.090 he\n00:08:50.720 no to to go to work I look for that\n00:08:53.449 dustbin because when I hit it it tells\n00:08:55.160 me to turn so that I can cross but one\n00:08:59.509 day this cleaner actually moved the\n00:09:01.189 dustbin and I need him to put it back\n00:09:04.389 and Bob realized that sharing his skill\n00:09:11.439 gave him a view into a whole new world\n00:09:14.170 that he was seeing the world with fresh\n00:09:16.759 eyes and with deeper compassion as a\n00:09:19.370 result so maybe you can take photographs\n00:09:23.060 maybe you can cook maybe you can do\n00:09:26.509 accounts maybe you can write stories or\n00:09:29.180 maybe you&#x27;re just a really good\n00:09:30.410 listening ear how could you use your\n00:09:33.949 skill in service of someone else\n00:09:40.810 my friend Wally uses his company and his\n00:09:45.500 voice he&#x27;s a filmmaker and he raises\n00:09:48.649 awareness or he&#x27;s sought to raise\n00:09:50.209 awareness when he&#x27;s not like making\n00:09:53.120 videos of like wedding or weddings or\n00:09:55.040 doing beautiful food photography that he\n00:09:58.670 decided he was going to do something to\n00:10:00.170 combat this this haze which has kind of\n00:10:01.939 been enveloping you know our our whole\n00:10:04.250 our whole region recently and he decided\n00:10:06.740 that instead of just like moaning about\n00:10:08.959 it like most of us that he was actually\n00:10:11.629 going to crowdfund for masks and for air\n00:10:14.779 quality monitors and he was going to go\n00:10:17.930 with volunteers down to Kalimantan to\n00:10:21.259 distribute them and help educate the\n00:10:23.240 local the local people there and he did\n00:10:27.230 this at a time when of course most of us\n00:10:31.220 were just moaning about a 400 you know\n00:10:35.209 pia PM 2.5 and and he told me that when\n00:10:39.439 he went to Kalimantan the monitors\n00:10:41.959 actually didn&#x27;t work but the year but\n00:10:43.459 the app with the actual PM 2.5 levels\n00:10:46.370 there were actually in excess of 2\n00:10:48.050 million society is made better because\n00:10:51.319 of Wally&#x27;s who share their voice Bob&#x27;s\n00:10:54.259 who share their skill and families like\n00:10:57.350 kaho and kauai who teach the next\n00:11:00.529 generation the values of generosity and\n00:11:03.319 the love for human\n00:11:05.680 society is better because of the two\n00:11:07.880 nameless sons of Hana for practicing\n00:11:11.270 their radical love so my dream is to see\n00:11:15.170 all these parts and pieces connected in\n00:11:17.390 a big Network where skills voices funds\n00:11:22.040 ideas are all shared in one place in our\n00:11:24.890 city and what if we were able to\n00:11:28.370 actually create a marketplace where the\n00:11:30.770 whole city comes together and can we\n00:11:33.080 create for our common good\n00:11:35.680 what if neighbors knew what was needed\n00:11:38.180 and that those needs could be met in a\n00:11:41.330 timely in a timely way with available\n00:11:44.300 resources we all have some margin to\n00:11:48.560 spare and to share we all have influence\n00:11:52.040 and voice and we have friends and\n00:11:54.680 colleagues and family members to reach\n00:11:56.870 out to and I believe that we all have\n00:11:59.660 dreams of being lovers of humanity in a\n00:12:03.740 city of good my colleagues and I are now\n00:12:07.760 imagining and trying to build this\n00:12:09.320 giving platform so we can be Wally&#x27;s\n00:12:11.750 Bob&#x27;s or Hannah&#x27;s children or we can\n00:12:14.330 support them with our voice our skills\n00:12:17.390 or our funds as an expression of our\n00:12:19.460 love and we are well aware that\n00:12:22.130 technology is not the solution but\n00:12:24.980 purely an enabler for philanthropy and\n00:12:27.020 acts of love to be expressed so look\n00:12:31.520 around you I think you&#x27;ll see a\n00:12:34.340 philanthropist waiting to be discovered\n00:12:37.510 thank you\n00:12:46.310 you\n", "title": "tactiq-free-transcript-cJ0gl44Q358.txt", "tether_id": null}, "status":

Rubenstein | TEDxPennsylvaniaAvenue\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/C1nCe1vaook\n\n00:00:01.790 [Music]\n00:00:12.240 as well let me tell you my briefly my\n00:00:13.759 story um I&#x27;m from Baltimore um my my\n00:00:17.119 last name is Rubenstein and you think if\n00:00:18.920 name like that you might be somebody who\n00:00:20.880 is from a wealthy family their father is\n00:00:22.519 a doctor lawyer but my father um dropped\n00:00:24.960 out of high school to go into World War\n00:00:26.439 II as part of the Marines came back he\n00:00:28.960 met my mother they got married uh\n00:00:30.840 neither graduated from high school my\n00:00:32.279 father worked in the post office his\n00:00:33.600 entire life made about $7,000 at the\n00:00:35.719 peak so I knew if I was going to get\n00:00:37.640 anywhere I probably had to do it on my\n00:00:39.120 own uh in the sixth grade I heard a\n00:00:41.520 speech that was given not far from here\n00:00:43.719 I watched it on television some of you\n00:00:45.160 may be old enough to remember this\n00:00:46.320 speech was given by John Kennedy and he\n00:00:48.559 said in his famous inaugural address\n00:00:50.039 which was only 14 minutes the greatest\n00:00:51.480 inaugural dress I think of the 20th\n00:00:53.000 century he ask not what your country can\n00:00:54.920 do for you but what you can do for your\n00:00:58.039 country and I that speech my teacher\n00:01:00.960 drilled it into our heads and I just\n00:01:02.239 said okay I want to do something for my\n00:01:03.920 country making money meant nothing to me\n00:01:05.720 my parents had no money I didn&#x27;t think\n00:01:07.240 about making money so I said I want to\n00:01:09.040 do something to help my country so\n00:01:10.720 ultimately I decided the way I could do\n00:01:12.080 it was to go to law school and\n00:01:13.840 ultimately work in government and do\n00:01:15.720 something that might help my country if\n00:01:17.759 I did a good job in government so I got\n00:01:19.640 a scholarship to Duke University I got a\n00:01:21.720 scholarship to univ Chicago law school\n00:01:23.600 and then I went to work in a law firm in\n00:01:25.040 New York that a partner at which was the\n00:01:27.600 man who wrote that speech for John\n00:01:29.119 Kennedy his name was Ted s the greatest\n00:01:30.720 presidential speech writer I think of\n00:01:32.079 all time and after a few years of\n00:01:34.240 working for him um he s of hinted maybe\n00:01:37.000 that I wasn&#x27;t such a great lawyer maybe\n00:01:38.479 I should do something different and I\n00:01:40.560 talked to my clients and I said well you\n00:01:42.200 know I might do something different what\n00:01:43.399 do you think they said now&#x27;s a good time\n00:01:44.680 to leave so I got the idea that I\n00:01:46.680 probably wasn&#x27;t a great lawyer and Ted\n00:01:48.640 saon got me an interview with a man he\n00:01:50.600 said we&#x27; be the next president United\n00:01:51.840 States I could work in the White House\n00:01:53.000 just as he had done for President\n00:01:54.079 Kennedy I got a job as the chief counsel\n00:01:56.200 for a man named burby who was running\n00:01:58.680 for president in 1976\n00:02:00.360 30 days after I joined his um Senate\n00:02:02.600 staff he dropped out of his presidential\n00:02:04.039 campaign so I said uhoh maybe this\n00:02:06.000 happened to some to you as well I wasn&#x27;t\n00:02:08.080 a good lawyer my clients didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:09.479 was good my colleagues didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:10.758 was good I went to join a campaign in\n00:02:13.520 effect it it ended after 30 days and\n00:02:15.560 then I got a call out of the blue some\n00:02:16.879 of you may have in your career as well\n00:02:18.560 it said uh would you like to work for\n00:02:20.519 another man running for president who is\n00:02:22.120 this Jimmy Carter and I said well he&#x27;s\n00:02:23.680 the peanut farmer from Georgia and they\n00:02:25.080 said yes he&#x27;s going to be the nominee\n00:02:26.120 for Democratic party in&#x27; 76 I got the\n00:02:28.000 interview I went down to Georgia Carter\n00:02:30.280 was 33 points ahead when I joined his\n00:02:32.000 campaign he won by one point so he he\n00:02:34.840 often said to me you know what did you\n00:02:36.200 really contribute but White House staffs\n00:02:37.680 are not filled on Merit they&#x27;re filled\n00:02:38.879 on who worked in the campaign so I\n00:02:40.519 became the deputy domestic policy\n00:02:42.040 adviser at the president United States\n00:02:43.280 at the age of 27 three years out of law\n00:02:45.200 school I wasn&#x27;t qualified for that job\n00:02:47.080 he wasn&#x27;t qualified for his job so I\n00:02:48.440 figured we fit in\n00:02:50.400 um I managed to get inflation to 19% in\n00:02:53.680 my job very difficult to get inflation\n00:02:55.560 19% nobody&#x27;s done it since um there was\n00:02:58.280 a rumor that I was going to be promoted\n00:02:59.680 in the second term to be the senior\n00:03:01.200 domestic adviser if Carter&#x27;s reelected\n00:03:03.040 and on the strength of that rumor\n00:03:04.080 President Carter thinks he lost the\n00:03:05.239 election so I had to go find a job I\n00:03:07.400 went back and practice law in Washington\n00:03:08.959 it took me many months to convince\n00:03:10.120 somebody I knew how to do something in\n00:03:11.560 practicing law after finding myself\n00:03:13.920 being humiliated because I was a White\n00:03:15.400 House Aid one day next day I couldn&#x27;t\n00:03:16.680 get a job at practicing law finally\n00:03:18.159 somebody felt sorry for me I practiced\n00:03:19.920 law but once again my client said to me\n00:03:21.959 you know this might not be for you and I\n00:03:24.080 said to my my partners what do you think\n00:03:25.920 about this should I stay and they said\n00:03:27.280 maybe not so I decided I would and I\n00:03:30.200 took a chance I read that on average an\n00:03:31.959 entrepreneur starts a company between\n00:03:33.400 the ages of 28 and 37 and I read that\n00:03:35.599 when I was 37 so I said okay I&#x27;m going\n00:03:38.120 to start a company so without knowing\n00:03:39.959 anything about Finance I decided to\n00:03:41.519 start something called the carw group\n00:03:43.640 and I started in Pennsylvania Avenue I\n00:03:45.280 recruited three people actually knew\n00:03:46.480 something about Finance I told them I\n00:03:48.159 had some money but I really was\n00:03:49.280 exaggerating I told him when they showed\n00:03:51.080 up I would get the money so ultimately\n00:03:53.400 uh we start a company with $5 million\n00:03:55.239 today we manage $200 billion and it&#x27;s\n00:03:57.519 turned out to be one of the largest\n00:03:58.480 private Equity firms in the world when I\n00:04:00.239 hit the age of 54 Forbes Magazine put a\n00:04:02.879 story out about my net worth and my\n00:04:04.599 partner&#x27;s net worth and it became\n00:04:05.920 obvious to me that I had made so much\n00:04:07.920 money that I couldn&#x27;t possibly spend it\n00:04:09.599 on on houses and planes and boats and so\n00:04:12.319 forth which I didn&#x27;t really care much\n00:04:13.720 about anyway so I decided what I would\n00:04:15.400 try to do is atone for my sins getting\n00:04:17.399 inflation to 19% and maybe give it back\n00:04:19.759 to the UN government give back to the US\n00:04:21.560 government give back to my country but I\n00:04:23.160 wasn&#x27;t sure how to do it and it came\n00:04:24.520 about in a kind of U unusual way one day\n00:04:27.600 I was invited to an uh an auction in in\n00:04:29.800 New York I was told I would be able to\n00:04:31.360 see the Magna Carta and I said how can\n00:04:33.440 you see the Magna Carta it&#x27;s in England\n00:04:34.720 it turned out there are 17 copies of the\n00:04:36.560 Magna Carta and I had a chance to to see\n00:04:38.960 one of them it was the only one in\n00:04:40.080 private hands I decided that I would try\n00:04:41.919 to buy that and make sure it stayed in\n00:04:43.360 the United States because it was\n00:04:44.280 probably going to be auctioned off I was\n00:04:45.440 told by the auctioneer and leave the\n00:04:47.000 country so I went back that next night I\n00:04:49.039 bought it and I now put it on display at\n00:04:50.880 the National Archives it&#x27;ll be there\n00:04:52.080 permanently and I said I&#x27;ll do this for\n00:04:53.759 the for the country is a way to kind of\n00:04:55.440 make sure this document which was the\n00:04:56.880 inspiration for the Declaration of\n00:04:58.080 Independence the Bill of Rights the\n00:04:59.680 Constitution stays here and then other\n00:05:01.479 documents came available the declaration\n00:05:03.199 independence the Emancipation\n00:05:04.360 Proclamation the 13th Amendment which\n00:05:05.800 Freeds slaves the Constitution the Bill\n00:05:07.720 of Rights and I bought rare copies of\n00:05:09.400 them and put them on display at the\n00:05:10.600 state department the national\n00:05:12.320 Constitution Center the Smithsonian the\n00:05:14.120 library Congress as a way of saying to\n00:05:16.240 Americans take a look at these and learn\n00:05:17.919 more about your history in a recent Pew\n00:05:19.800 survey it turned out that 35% of\n00:05:21.840 Americans when they asked what river did\n00:05:23.160 George washingon cross during the\n00:05:24.440 Revolutionary War said the Rin River not\n00:05:27.039 that&#x27;s not true 33% of Americans when\n00:05:29.479 they asked who was the first treasury\n00:05:30.720 secretary didn&#x27;t know it was Alexander\n00:05:32.479 hamilt and they said it was Larry\n00:05:33.479 Summers so my theory is Americans don&#x27;t\n00:05:35.600 know enough about their history and you\n00:05:36.759 can be a better uh citizen if you know\n00:05:38.759 more about your history so I&#x27;m trying to\n00:05:39.960 buy these historic documents and put\n00:05:41.720 them on display make sure people know\n00:05:43.520 more about history as a way of\n00:05:44.880 introducing them to our history another\n00:05:46.840 thing happened by S tippity as well one\n00:05:48.639 time I was at the keny center and the\n00:05:50.919 man on the board was the head of the\n00:05:52.160 Park Service he told me that Washington\n00:05:53.520 Monument had suffered earthquake damage\n00:05:55.199 I told him I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll put\n00:05:56.639 up the money just ignore the government\n00:05:58.280 and the usual constraints forget\n00:05:59.680 Congress tell me how much it cost I&#x27;ll\n00:06:01.199 put up the money to fix it so he did he\n00:06:02.800 later came back and said Congress wanted\n00:06:04.039 to share the credit because they weren&#x27;t\n00:06:05.560 getting a lot of good credit so they\n00:06:06.560 said can they put up half the money I\n00:06:07.840 said okay so I just put up the money to\n00:06:10.199 repair the Washington Monument some of\n00:06:11.599 you may have seen the scaffolding there\n00:06:12.960 from time to time and then I came up\n00:06:14.520 with the idea that well that was a good\n00:06:15.960 idea but why not fix other historic\n00:06:17.800 things so I decided to help fix up\n00:06:20.000 monachello Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s home mon\n00:06:22.000 peer James Madison&#x27;s home Mount Vernon\n00:06:24.039 George Washington&#x27;s home the custus Lee\n00:06:25.840 Mansion at the top of Arlington and some\n00:06:27.639 other things that I&#x27;ll announce uh down\n00:06:29.120 the road and so what I&#x27;ve decided to do\n00:06:30.680 is to fix these historic buildings in\n00:06:33.000 part because I want to remind Americans\n00:06:34.319 of their history and try to do what I&#x27;m\n00:06:35.960 now called patriotic philanthropy which\n00:06:37.680 means giving back to your country and\n00:06:39.599 all of us have probably been benefited\n00:06:41.720 from this country more than we might\n00:06:43.039 think if I had grown up with my last\n00:06:44.639 name and with my modest means in another\n00:06:46.479 country I don&#x27;t think I would have been\n00:06:47.520 able to do what I&#x27;ve been able to do so\n00:06:49.080 I want to dedicate my life now to giving\n00:06:51.360 back to the country I assigned the\n00:06:52.720 giving pledge I was the only person in\n00:06:54.039 the private Equity industry and the and\n00:06:55.919 one of the first 40 people that signed\n00:06:57.440 the giving pledge which says you&#x27;re\n00:06:58.360 going to give away half your money but\n00:06:59.759 I&#x27;ve decided to give away all my money\n00:07:01.400 on the theory that my children really\n00:07:02.759 aren&#x27;t going to be benefiting from all\n00:07:04.080 this money now they may not agree with\n00:07:05.560 that completely but um there&#x27;s no\n00:07:08.160 evidence that people that inherit $500\n00:07:09.879 million go on to win a Nobel Peace Prize\n00:07:11.759 were doing something wonderful usually\n00:07:13.319 the people who do great things in the\n00:07:14.520 Life are people that don&#x27;t inherit\n00:07:16.560 enormous sums of money there&#x27;s obviously\n00:07:18.520 exceptions but but I thought that my\n00:07:20.160 kids would be better off if they really\n00:07:21.840 had the modest means uh going along it\n00:07:24.039 that I had and give them more drive so\n00:07:26.199 I&#x27;m trying to give away my money in ways\n00:07:27.720 that say to the country thank you thank\n00:07:30.039 you for what you&#x27;ve done but I try to\n00:07:31.400 remind people you don&#x27;t need to be\n00:07:33.520 wealthy to be a philanthropist you don&#x27;t\n00:07:34.919 need to be wealthy to help your country\n00:07:36.479 philanthropy is an ancient Greek word\n00:07:38.080 that means loving Humanity it doesn&#x27;t\n00:07:39.599 say rich people writing checks so you\n00:07:41.360 can give your time your your energy your\n00:07:43.720 ideas whatever it it might be you can be\n00:07:46.080 a great philanthropist I think Wendy cop\n00:07:48.199 who created Teach for America she didn&#x27;t\n00:07:49.800 have a lot of money but she created that\n00:07:51.360 that organization which has helped\n00:07:52.440 America a great deal and she&#x27;s a great\n00:07:54.159 philanthropist in my view I don&#x27;t like\n00:07:56.039 it when you see the great list of\n00:07:57.599 philanthropists and it only lists how\n00:07:58.800 much money they&#x27;ve given not how much\n00:08:00.360 time or energy or ideas they might have\n00:08:01.840 given to the country but think back on\n00:08:03.759 this uh all of you uh what have you done\n00:08:06.840 to help your country all of you probably\n00:08:08.360 have come from different backgrounds but\n00:08:09.800 all of you have benefited from the the\n00:08:11.720 freedoms and the rights and that this\n00:08:13.759 country has now we&#x27;re not a perfect\n00:08:15.120 country for sure we&#x27;ve struggled for\n00:08:16.800 many years to get certain rights and we\n00:08:18.400 still don&#x27;t have all these rights but\n00:08:20.039 still it&#x27;s an extraordinary country and\n00:08:22.080 it&#x27;s going to be made even more\n00:08:23.319 extraordinary if we get citizens to want\n00:08:24.879 to give back to the country not just\n00:08:26.720 take from the country so in my modest\n00:08:28.639 means when I&#x27;m trying to do is to say I\n00:08:30.560 will buy historic documents make sure\n00:08:32.440 that people see them and that they&#x27;re\n00:08:34.000 part of our country&#x27;s history forever\n00:08:35.958 and and people can see them all the time\n00:08:37.719 whenever they want to see them and learn\n00:08:38.839 more about history keep fix up our\n00:08:40.640 historic monuments not because they&#x27;re\n00:08:42.159 the most important things in our country\n00:08:43.519 there are many more important things but\n00:08:45.320 it&#x27;s a way of saying this symbolic uh\n00:08:47.800 representation of our country is worth\n00:08:49.440 your knowing about it learn more about\n00:08:51.160 the history of George Washington Thomas\n00:08:52.680 Jefferson James Madison the founding\n00:08:54.399 fathers because if you do so you can be\n00:08:56.080 a better informed citizen now if you&#x27;re\n00:08:58.040 selfish you could say to yourself why\n00:08:59.800 should I be a philanthropist why should\n00:09:01.560 I give back why don&#x27;t I just give money\n00:09:03.240 to myself and buy homes well think about\n00:09:05.320 this the great philanthropists live a\n00:09:06.959 long time so you could look at it\n00:09:08.480 selfishly John D Rockefeller lived to be\n00:09:10.640 97 David Rockefeller just turned 100 I\n00:09:13.279 have a theory that God looks favorably\n00:09:15.000 on people who give away their\n00:09:16.600 money he keeps them on Earth for a long\n00:09:19.120 time so no philanthropist drops dead\n00:09:21.560 very quickly so if you&#x27;re just selfish\n00:09:23.519 about it if you want to live a long time\n00:09:25.480 give away your money or give away your\n00:09:26.880 time your energy your ideas because I\n00:09:28.519 think there&#x27;s a very good thing uh uh\n00:09:31.360 that&#x27;s likely to await you now I do have\n00:09:33.160 a theory that not only will you live a\n00:09:34.560 long time but there&#x27;s a special place in\n00:09:36.640 heaven reserved for people that do\n00:09:38.839 philanthropy now I can&#x27;t prove that but\n00:09:41.279 why would you want to take a chance\n00:09:43.519 right so it&#x27;s very important I think in\n00:09:47.200 this country that people should learn\n00:09:49.560 more about the history of the country\n00:09:51.480 learn more about how we&#x27;ve got where we\n00:09:53.560 are the mistakes we made so that we can\n00:09:55.320 avoid repeating these mistakes and I\n00:09:57.440 think everybody here should look back\n00:09:59.160 and what they&#x27;re doing with their life\n00:10:01.079 you&#x27;re only on this Earth for a very\n00:10:02.959 short period of time you if you&#x27;re lucky\n00:10:05.120 80 years 85 years 90 years if you&#x27;re\n00:10:07.519 very lucky but and that&#x27;s a very short\n00:10:10.120 span of time really when you consider\n00:10:11.839 that humans have been on the earth for\n00:10:12.959 maybe a million years or so and you&#x27;re\n00:10:14.519 going to be here for a short period of\n00:10:15.760 time don&#x27;t get to your deathbed and say\n00:10:18.079 I wish I had done something to help my\n00:10:19.680 country I wish I had done something to\n00:10:21.399 help my community do it when you&#x27;re\n00:10:22.920 younger don&#x27;t wait till you&#x27;re 54 years\n00:10:24.519 old don&#x27;t wait till you do the kind of\n00:10:26.560 things I did do it younger and make it\n00:10:28.760 part of your DNA and I think if we can\n00:10:30.880 do that and we can get young people to\n00:10:32.279 do this and we can get people to get\n00:10:33.560 their children to do it the country will\n00:10:35.079 be a better place very often we take for\n00:10:37.320 granted the great rights and freedoms\n00:10:39.200 this country has given us while it&#x27;s not\n00:10:41.480 a perfect country it&#x27;s a better country\n00:10:43.279 in my view than any other country with\n00:10:44.720 the freedoms and rights and the\n00:10:45.839 opportunities we have and so I think we\n00:10:47.639 should do something to say thank you to\n00:10:49.120 the country from time to time not in an\n00:10:50.920 unduly patriotic way not in a way that\n00:10:53.279 makes patriotism something that is\n00:10:55.519 something you can hide behind but\n00:10:57.079 something that you&#x27;re not afraid of of\n00:10:59.519 being patriotic I&#x27;m not afraid of saying\n00:11:01.279 I&#x27;m a patriotic philanthropist I&#x27;m\n00:11:03.079 giving back to the country because I&#x27;m\n00:11:04.560 proud of being an American I&#x27;m proud\n00:11:06.279 that I was able to do what I&#x27;m able to\n00:11:07.519 do and I&#x27;m proud the country made it\n00:11:09.200 possible for me to do this so all of you\n00:11:11.360 as you think about what you&#x27;re doing\n00:11:12.560 with your life think about what more you\n00:11:14.480 might be able to do if you just spent a\n00:11:16.440 little time giving back to the country\n00:11:18.279 in some modest way it doesn&#x27;t have to be\n00:11:19.959 rep repairing a monument or buying a\n00:11:21.480 document but just something that you can\n00:11:23.279 do that you can say later in life or\n00:11:26.000 even now yes I&#x27;ve done something to give\n00:11:27.880 back to my country and yes have done\n00:11:29.680 something to make the world a slightly\n00:11:31.040 better place all of us on this Earth for\n00:11:33.040 periods of time that are relatively\n00:11:34.360 short as I mentioned nobody knows why\n00:11:36.440 we&#x27;re really here but presumably we&#x27;re\n00:11:38.200 here to make the wood a slightly better\n00:11:39.680 place and we shouldn&#x27;t wait until the\n00:11:41.639 end of our life and say uh oh I better\n00:11:43.320 do something for the next last five\n00:11:44.800 years of my life do it earlier and don&#x27;t\n00:11:47.279 don&#x27;t hesitate to do so and don&#x27;t worry\n00:11:49.560 only about your career worry about\n00:11:51.279 helping the country as well

Initiative Foundation, I am deeply committed to our mission of enhancing the well-being and happiness of individuals globally. The differences between development and fundraising are crucial in our approach to achieving this mission. Fundraising, in our context, is about gathering the necessary resources to support our activities directly. It often involves specific campaigns or events aimed at meeting immediate financial needs. Development, on the other hand, is a broader and more strategic endeavor that not only encompasses fundraising efforts but also includes building and nurturing long-term relationships with our donors and partners.\n\nDevelopment is about creating a sustainable foundation for our initiatives through strategic planning and community engagement. It involves understanding and aligning with our donors&#x27; motivations, ensuring that they see the tangible impacts of their contributions, and fostering a philanthropic culture that supports our long-term vision of global happiness.\n\nTo positively contribute to our fundraising efforts through development, I plan to enact several strategic initiatives:\n1. **Strengthening Community Engagement**: We will actively involve community members in both the planning and implementation phases of our projects. This will not only ensure that our programs are well-aligned with the actual needs of the communities but also enhance the commitment and support of our donors who value tangible and meaningful impacts.\n2. **Building Strategic Partnerships**: By forming alliances with local and international organizations, we can leverage additional expertise and resources. These partnerships will enhance our operational capabilities and extend our reach, ultimately increasing the efficiency and impact of our fundraising efforts.\n3. **Transparency and Communication**: We will maintain high levels of transparency about how funds are being used and the impacts they are achieving. Regular updates and impact reports will be shared with our donors and the public, which will help in building trust and reinforcing the effectiveness of their contributions.\n\nThese strategies are designed not just to meet our immediate fundraising goals but to build a resilient and scalable operation that can sustain and expand its impact globally. Through thoughtful development practices, we aim to create a robust platform that supports our mission of promoting happiness and well-being worldwide."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

We believe that an individual&#x27;s happiness is not just a personal achievement but a societal asset. A content person is a beacon of positivity capable of enriching their community. When we collectively strive for happiness we also invest in our well-being and foster a society free from the shackles of discontent. These ideas reflect our vision where individual happiness is the cornerstone of societal harmony.\nAs the renowned author John Donne (2010)  famously proclaimed \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d This sentiment holds true in our pursuit of societal greatness. Achieving this requires unity and collaboration. However when an individual is grappling with internal conflicts such as mental health struggles physical ailments and a general decline in well-being overcoming these challenges alone becomes an insurmountable task. Wellness is not just a personal concern but a societal issue that impacts us all.\nIn addition to discussing wellness it is necessary also to address the role of education. If wellness is the foundation education is the next step where individuals acquire the necessary skills to lead purposeful dignified and joyful lives. Nobody is inherently equipped with the knowledge to improve their surroundings; it must be learned. Therefore education holds equal significance in the pursuit of wellness. As one begins to grasp the world&#x27;s order concepts like the principles of space and time the philosophies of Aristotle the mathematics of our universe and the evocative poetry of Yates one starts to perceive the world in a new nuanced way. Therefore to truly understand oneself it is sometimes necessary to first understand one&#x27;s environment. Thus in parallel with well-being education holds great importance.\nAs individuals gain knowledge about the world around them they instinctively desire to explore it further engaging with it through the senses of touch taste and sight. Rather than solely studying Mozart and reading musical notations experiencing the music in person is essential. Therefore travel is an invaluable gateway to becoming a well-rounded individual capable of positively contributing to society.\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to creating a better world. By leveraging the support of donor investors the foundation aims to empower individuals to pursue their own happiness by providing necessary tools. Our efforts involve establishing partnerships with local government bodies and healthcare providers to ensure easy access to government services and healthcare and make travel accessible to all who desire it. These initiatives will lay the foundation for our long-term vision of a globally interconnected and joyful society.\nPurpose\nThe primary purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally through increased access to essential life-enhancing services. The Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to providing the necessary tools for individuals to pursue their happiness. Our starting point is ensuring access to healthcare and mental health services as a fundamental human right and a crucial component in our efforts to build a better world. We also aim to utilize well-being travel cultural immersion and education resources to empower individuals to gain self-awareness understand others and collectively achieve holistic happiness.\nGoals\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to enhancing the global quality of life through two strategic goals.\n\nLong-term Goal: Increase Access to Key Well-being Services\nOur long-term goal is to significantly increase access to key well-being services globally with our efforts first being localized in the United States and Italy. By doing so we aim to improve the quality of life and foster sustained happiness in diverse communities. This goal will not only benefit the communities we serve but also provide donor-investors with the satisfaction of knowing that their support is making a tangible difference in people&#x27;s lives. The impact of these programs will be measured by tracking the number of individuals accessing these services the improvement in health and education outcomes and overall satisfaction rates among participants reflecting the direct benefits of our initiatives.\nShort-term Goal: Establish and Strengthen Partnerships\nPartnerships are at the heart of our strategy. Our short-term goal is to establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international public and private organizations. These partnerships are not just beneficial; they are crucial for enhancing our capability to deliver critical services effectively and efficiently. By collaborating with organizations with established infrastructures and expertise in our target regions we can leverage their strengths to better serve the communities&#x27; needs. Formalizing at least five significant partnerships within the first six months will be vital to achieving this goal.\nBoth goals complement existing efforts in the target communities rather than duplicate them ensuring that our interventions add value and create a measurable impact. Through these focused efforts the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation seeks to build a foundation for long-term social change that contributes to the well-being of individuals worldwide.\n\nObjectives\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) has set ambitious yet achievable objectives to ensure a broad and lasting impact on global well-being.\nEducational Expansion\nOur first objective focuses on education expansion. Within the first year GHIF plans to launch educational programs in at least two countries aiming to reach over 5000 individuals. These programs will be developed to address local educational gaps better equip youths with functional skills  and promote holistic learning experiences. Evidence shows that educational programs can significantly enhance psychological well-being by increasing self-efficacy social support and overall life satisfaction (Ross &amp; Willigen 1997). Moreover education has been linked to improved health outcomes and better mental health with increased years of education correlating with lower rates of depression and anxiety (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder 2022). The success of these programs will be measured by the number of programs successfully launched the total number of participants enrolled and participant feedback on program effectiveness.\nHealthcare Partnerships\nSimultaneously GHIF aims to establish healthcare partnerships to enhance access to medical and mental health services. By the end of the first six months we will secure partnerships with at least five major healthcare providers. These collaborations will focus on providing comprehensive health services emphasizing preventive care and mental health which are crucial for improving individual well-being. Studies have shown that partnerships between educational institutions and healthcare providers can significantly improve health outcomes particularly in preventive care and mental health services (Ross &amp; Wu 1995). The effectiveness of these partnerships will be assessed through the number of agreements signed the range of services provided and feedback from service users regarding the accessibility and quality of care.\nWellness Travel Model\nLastly our third objective is to develop a wellness travel model which will be designed developed and ready for implementation within the first eighteen months. This model will provide frameworks for wellness-oriented travel experiences promoting mental and physical health benefits through carefully crafted travel packages. Wellness programs embedded in educational and travel contexts have shown positive impacts on well-being reducing stress and improving mental health (Young et al. 2020). The model\u2019s success will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction measured through surveys and the repeat engagement rate indicating the model&#x27;s appeal and effectiveness in enhancing participants&#x27; well-being.\nOrganizational Capacity\nFoundation Structure and Management Capability:\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is designed to be a robust organization capable of managing large-scale projects and substantial grants. At its inception GHIF will establish a governance structure with a board of directors comprising education healthcare mental health and non-profit management experts. This board will provide strategic oversight and ensure all activities align with our mission and objectives.\nFounding Team Expertise:\nThe founding team of GHIF will include highly qualified professionals selected for their extensive experience in project management international development healthcare and educational programming. Our recruitment strategy focuses on identifying individuals with a proven track record such as a Project Director with significant experience in managing and scaling community health programs an Education Specialist renowned for developing effective curricula in diverse cultural settings and a Mental Health Advocate with a strong background in leading global mental wellness initiatives. This planned assembly of expertise ensures a comprehensive and skilled approach to achieving the foundation\u2019s objectives.\nProject Management Systems:\nGHIF will implement rigorous project management methodologies to oversee all foundation activities. We will utilize established frameworks such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guidelines to plan execute monitor and close projects. Additionally GHIF will adopt modern project management tools for real-time tracking and reporting facilitating transparent and efficient management of the grant funds.\nPreparatory Actions for Grant Management:\nPrior to receiving the grant GHIF will:\nFormulate detailed project plans including timelines budgets and resource allocation.\nEstablish financial management policies tailored to ensure accountability and prudent use of funds.\nInitiate discussions with potential partners and stakeholders to build a support network for immediate project launch upon funding.\nDemonstrating Capacity through Strategic Intentions:\nWhile GHIF is a nascent organization our strategic planning reflects a clear and actionable roadmap for immediate impact upon funding. The foundation\u2019s goals are backed by a commitment to leverage the diverse skills of its team and the strategic insights of its board to establish a high-performing organization. GHIF&#x27;s initial actions and detailed project preparations demonstrate our readiness and capability to effectively manage and utilize the grant to achieve significant social impact.\nCross-Sector Collaboration \nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to developing localized high-impact programs that serve as models for global implementation. To achieve this GHIF emphasizes cross-sector collaboration mainly focusing on strategic partnerships in Italy and the United States. These collaborations are designed to leverage regional strengths and address specific local needs ensuring the adaptability and effectiveness of our well-being services.\nLocalized Educational Partnerships\nGHIF will collaborate with leading educational institutions in Italy and the United States to integrate well-being practices into educational curricula. This initiative will focus on regions with significant disparities in educational outcomes providing targeted interventions that are culturally and contextually relevant. Research indicates that collaborative learning environments and educational partnerships can significantly enhance student outcomes and well-being (Kilgo et al. 2015). Success in these partnerships will be evaluated based on academic improvements student well-being metrics and the scalability of the programs to other regions.\nHealthcare Alliances\nGHIF plans to partner with healthcare organizations in Italy and the United States to increase access to quality health services. These partnerships will focus on integrating mental health services with primary care a critical need in both countries according to local health reports. Studies have shown cross-sector healthcare collaborations can improve health outcomes particularly when mental health services are integrated with primary care (Randall et al. 2023). By working with local health providers and community organizations these initiatives aim to create sustainable health improvement models suitable for global replication.\nPublic-Private Partnerships\nGHIF will seek partnerships with local government bodies and private sectors in Italy and the United States to support infrastructure development vital to program delivery. These partnerships will help facilitate the creation of community wellness centers which will serve as hubs for education healthcare and community activities. Effective public-private partnerships have been shown to significantly enhance community health and well-being (Ovseiko et al. 2014). The effectiveness of these centers will be measured through community engagement rates and the overall improvement in community health and educational outcomes.\nCommunity Engagement\nIntegral to our strategy is the direct involvement of local communities in Italy and the United States in the planning and implementation phases. GHIF believes that community input is essential to tailoring programs that genuinely reflect and meet local needs. Feedback mechanisms and community advisory boards will be established to monitor the programs\u2019 impacts and guide iterative improvements as evidence proves that community involvement is crucial for the success and sustainability of public health programs (Mattessich &amp; Rausch 2014).\nProgram Plan\nIntroduction to Program Strategy\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to addressing critical needs in communities across the United States and Italy. We implement multifaceted strategies that enhance individual well-being and community health specifically designed to complement rather than duplicate existing services. Our comprehensive approach leverages local strengths and targets specific challenges through innovative and sustainable solutions.\nIntegration with Government and Healthcare Services\nOur initiative targets significant gaps in access to healthcare and government support services. These gaps have been identified through extensive community outreach and stakeholder engagement underscoring a pressing need for improved service accessibility and quality. To address these challenges GHIF plans to forge strategic alliances with local health departments and social service agencies creating a referral network that simplifies the process for individuals to access the services they need. This network aims to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of health and social care systems.\nPartnership development is crucial for the success of our healthcare integration strategy. By collaborating with local health authorities and service providers we aim to establish robust partnerships that facilitate streamlined access to healthcare and support services. These partnerships will be foundational in building a comprehensive referral system that enhances service delivery and meets the specific needs of the communities we serve.\nIn addition to building partnerships GHIF will engage in advocacy and policy work to enhance healthcare delivery. We will work closely with policymakers to advocate for regulations and policies prioritizing the health and well-being of underrepresented communities. Our focus on advocacy aims to influence policy changes that improve healthcare accessibility and address systemic barriers in service delivery.\nTraining community health workers is another critical component of our strategy. GHIF will implement comprehensive training programs designed to enhance the capabilities of health workers in assisting individuals effectively. These programs will focus on developing empathy technical skills and a deep understanding of the healthcare system. This will ensure that community health workers are well-equipped to support individuals in navigating health and social services.\nWellness Travel Model\nGHIF recognizes the therapeutic potential of travel in promoting mental and physical well-being. To harness this potential we are developing a Wellness Travel Model that integrates health benefits with cultural and educational experiences. This innovative approach to wellness extends beyond traditional health settings and includes travel packages that feature guided meditations wellness workshops and cultural tours. Each package is designed in collaboration with travel experts and cultural institutions to ensure that it offers genuine health benefits and facilitates cultural appreciation.\nCommunity-based involvement is integral to the design and execution of our Wellness Travel Model. We engage local communities in developing travel experiences to ensure they are culturally respectful and enriching for visitors and hosts. This engagement helps create authentic travel experiences sensitive to the host communities&#x27; cultural dynamics and provides meaningful interactions that benefit all participants.\nHolistic Educational Access\nGHIF is also dedicated to transforming educational access by integrating a curriculum that includes advanced technology training and comprehensive arts education. This holistic approach aims to bridge the gap in technological and creative skills preparing individuals for the demands of the modern workforce and personal development. Our curriculum includes coding robotics visual arts and music training and is designed to be integrated into school systems and community learning centers.\nGHIF will establish ongoing learning opportunities through workshops and seminars open to all age groups to complement our formal education initiatives. These initiatives focus on continuous skill development and personal growth promoting lifelong learning and adaptability. By offering workshops and seminars that cover a range of skills and artistic disciplines we aim to foster an environment of continuous learning and creative exploration.\nTimeline and Evaluation\nThe timeline for these initiatives is strategically set to ensure a phased implementation. By the end of the second quarter of 2025 GHIF will establish the initial partnerships necessary for the referral systems and develop training programs for community health workers. Following the establishment of partnerships early in the same year the Wellness Travel Packages are expected to be launched by the third quarter of 2025. Educational program rollouts will begin in the fourth quarter of 2024 and be fully implemented across targeted regions by the second quarter of 2025.\nEach element of the program plan is designed to measure specific outcomes related to access satisfaction and educational attainment ensuring that GHIF&#x27;s interventions create measurable and sustainable impacts in the communities served. This strategic planning demonstrates GHIF&#x27;s capability to manage a large grant effectively and fulfill its mission of building a foundation for long-term social change that contributes significantly to global well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\t\nDeliverables\t\nActivities\t\nDue Date\t\nExpected Challenges\n\t\nSet up Referral Systems\t\nEstablish partnerships develop training for staff\t\nQ2 2025\t\nRegulatory hurdles securing partner cooperation\n\t\nLaunch Wellness Travel Packages\t\nDesign packages negotiate with travel agencies\t\nQ3 2025\t\nLogistics coordination ensuring accessibility and inclusion\n\t\nRollout Educational Programs\t\nDevelop curricula and integrate into schools\t\nQ4 2025\t\nAdaptation to local educational standards funding\n\t\nPublic Workshops and Seminars\t\nPlan and implement workshops and lifelong learning seminars\t\nQ1 2026\t\nCommunity engagement sustaining interest over time\n\n\nReferences\nCunningham W.

https://www.youtube.com/watch/cJ0gl44Q358\n\n00:00:03.200 in 2009 Forbes magazine wrote an article\n00:00:08.029 that featured me in their heroes of\n00:00:12.750 philanthropy edition something is\n00:00:15.839 actually a little uncomfortable with but\n00:00:18.300 you couldn&#x27;t quite stop them I&#x27;d been\n00:00:20.939 working with my family&#x27;s business at the\n00:00:22.769 time and we were in the process of\n00:00:25.710 opening a hotel and at the same time I\n00:00:30.570 had also been involved with various\n00:00:32.159 nonprofits and it actually found out too\n00:00:36.989 that so many of the migrant workers the\n00:00:41.040 men and women who come to Singapore to\n00:00:42.570 clean to build to service Singapore\n00:00:47.190 we&#x27;re actually paying anywhere from six\n00:00:49.890 months even to two years of their\n00:00:52.590 salaries to labor agents that was not\n00:00:57.210 acceptable so my friend Peter and I\n00:01:00.949 thought about trying to create an\n00:01:04.170 alternative system a different way to\n00:01:07.830 recruit people and so we created a new\n00:01:12.540 process that would cap fees that would\n00:01:16.409 tell the people who are coming here\n00:01:18.150 exactly what they were getting for\n00:01:19.680 anything that they were paying and would\n00:01:21.900 actually help prepare them before they\n00:01:23.820 came to manage their expectations and\n00:01:25.799 actually welcome them once they had\n00:01:29.070 arrived it was important to me that we\n00:01:34.259 were able to help them feel at home so\n00:01:38.159 it was a little more effort than usual\n00:01:40.049 maybe but this was a business that I\n00:01:42.509 could influence in a small way for that\n00:01:45.689 for the better and I didn&#x27;t do it to be\n00:01:47.909 a philanthropist I did it because it was\n00:01:50.700 the right thing to do and maybe that&#x27;s\n00:01:53.640 what being a philanthropist is all about\n00:01:57.560 so what do you think of when you hear\n00:02:00.299 the word philanthropist who or what\n00:02:03.960 comes to mind\n00:02:05.600 tech giant wildly crazy entrepreneur\n00:02:12.390 super savvy investor I guess in many of\n00:02:17.680 our minds it&#x27;s sort of the rich and the\n00:02:19.060 powerful who give away millions if not\n00:02:21.310 billions to rid the world of of\n00:02:23.440 preventable diseases from which millions\n00:02:25.750 die every year or maybe rebuilding\n00:02:28.420 cities or maybe creating education and\n00:02:32.769 investing in disenfranchised populations\n00:02:37.500 but what&#x27;s the problem with this picture\n00:02:40.299 I think the biggest challenge is that\n00:02:43.209 philanthropy and the idea of being a\n00:02:45.549 philanthropist is such a far cry from\n00:02:47.680 everybody&#x27;s everyday life day jobs\n00:02:50.680 childcare managing homework but I&#x27;d like\n00:02:55.030 to challenge this idea about how\n00:02:56.859 philanthropy and the loving of humanity\n00:03:00.159 and the exercise of one values to\n00:03:03.400 benefit another is actually something\n00:03:05.560 that can happen every day by anyone\n00:03:08.140 anywhere in small simple personal and\n00:03:13.150 meaningful ways I&#x27;d like to challenge\n00:03:16.180 the idea that the person you&#x27;d least\n00:03:18.579 expect\n00:03:19.299 could be a philanthropist and that the\n00:03:21.940 sum of many small parts has an enormous\n00:03:24.940 impact and that everyone with some skill\n00:03:28.450 or talent can share and that together we\n00:03:33.849 can create a new culture based on these\n00:03:36.370 ideas so how many of you have raised\n00:03:41.410 funds or funded something on a\n00:03:44.319 crowdfunding site okay reasonable\n00:03:49.150 proportion of you there\n00:03:50.400 well a lot of us think of these sites is\n00:03:53.049 actually being very commercially\n00:03:54.400 oriented but did you know that in 2012\n00:03:58.260 the online site that site Kickstarter\n00:04:02.220 actually exceeded the National Endowment\n00:04:04.810 for the Arts in terms of funds\n00:04:06.910 distributed to arts groups in the United\n00:04:09.040 States and as of this year Kickstarter\n00:04:12.910 has raised one and a half billion\n00:04:15.040 dollars for over 80,000 art projects\n00:04:19.149 that gave aspiring artists theatre\n00:04:21.760 practitioners musicians filmmakers and\n00:04:24.370 the\n00:04:24.970 a chance to realize their dreams with an\n00:04:27.940 average contribution of $25 perhaps\n00:04:35.920 though less obvious are hidden heroes\n00:04:39.010 whose life choices can really inspire us\n00:04:41.610 a couple years ago I vetted I visited\n00:04:44.920 Myanmar and I met this woman Hana so she\n00:04:49.450 was living about an hour and a half\n00:04:50.710 outside of Yangon and she ran an\n00:04:52.600 orphanage with 19 children from the ages\n00:04:54.730 of like 3 months all the way up to 2 18\n00:04:58.270 years old the older kids helped the\n00:05:01.120 younger kids the place was completely\n00:05:02.710 spotless everybody&#x27;s toothbrush was\n00:05:05.080 really neatly lined up in the washing\n00:05:06.940 area and then when I asked her who\n00:05:09.340 supports you she told me a church in\n00:05:13.330 Singapore and my two sons and my first\n00:05:17.740 impression was of course that her two\n00:05:19.150 sons were like doctors lawyers or\n00:05:21.010 accountants or something you know maybe\n00:05:23.290 in Yangon or maybe even expats somewhere\n00:05:26.590 else but I asked her and they were\n00:05:29.620 actually expats but one was a security\n00:05:33.940 guard in a shopping mall and the other\n00:05:36.400 one was a construction worker and so\n00:05:40.090 later that week when I came home I\n00:05:42.090 glanced at that Burmese security guard\n00:05:46.150 and I saw him with new eyes could he\n00:05:49.960 have been the philanthropist that funded\n00:05:52.210 Hannah&#x27;s home I imagined them eating\n00:05:55.840 sparingly not spending very much on\n00:05:58.450 personal luxuries and probably saving\n00:06:00.970 50% of their salaries to remit back home\n00:06:04.510 and then I thought you know that&#x27;s\n00:06:08.020 pretty much what Bill Gates and Warren\n00:06:10.330 Buffett decided to do with the Giving\n00:06:12.100 Pledge back at home last year we\n00:06:15.790 actually also undertook this fascinating\n00:06:18.160 experiment we found two brothers Kauai\n00:06:21.430 and kaha aged 9 and 11 and these two\n00:06:25.630 brothers had posted or I guess their\n00:06:27.490 mother had posted on social media that\n00:06:29.080 they were giving away their own Bao\n00:06:31.240 money you know collected during Chinese\n00:06:33.940 Chinese New Year to the Singapore Cancer\n00:06:36.040 Society I guess they had\n00:06:37.550 family related resonance with that with\n00:06:41.480 the cause and these two brothers had\n00:06:44.870 just decided to do that and so we seize\n00:06:47.150 the day and we said hey let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s\n00:06:48.770 share this idea let&#x27;s tell other people\n00:06:51.170 that you know maybe they could do that\n00:06:52.550 too if even if it&#x27;s 1% 5% or 10% you\n00:06:56.630 know of whatever they could they could\n00:06:58.520 make a giveaway from from their own\n00:07:00.170 phone money to support a cause that just\n00:07:02.270 represented something that their family\n00:07:04.640 cared about and the results were\n00:07:07.520 astounding in the first 20 days of\n00:07:10.760 Chinese New Year donations through our\n00:07:13.040 online site were up 73 percent\n00:07:16.970 year-on-year it was a simple fun and\n00:07:20.330 meaningful idea that every everyone\n00:07:22.640 could participate in and it made all the\n00:07:24.650 difference to the nonprofit&#x27;s that they\n00:07:26.600 supported but giving is a lot more than\n00:07:32.030 just money\n00:07:33.020 it&#x27;s time it&#x27;s loving when you&#x27;re it&#x27;s\n00:07:36.650 loving your neighbor\n00:07:37.610 it&#x27;s person-to-person and it&#x27;s the\n00:07:41.030 offering of even if like our skills so a\n00:07:44.330 great a great Singaporean actually is a\n00:07:47.480 photographer Bob Lee some of you may\n00:07:50.120 have may have heard of him or seen him\n00:07:51.800 too and he was asked to teach\n00:07:54.440 photography to the blind he was called\n00:07:58.640 one day by a charity dialogue in the\n00:08:00.320 dark and and and given this intriguing\n00:08:04.040 offer sponsors had come in to help\n00:08:07.040 provide cameras printing services and\n00:08:09.230 space and everything and and Bob began\n00:08:12.830 to teach and one of his students was it\n00:08:17.390 was a gentleman called an elderly\n00:08:18.950 gentleman called uncle William and he\n00:08:20.780 produced his first photograph as you can\n00:08:22.970 see here kind of like cut off legs of\n00:08:26.000 someone and a dustbin and Bob asked him\n00:08:30.110 what&#x27;s what&#x27;s that about William we\n00:08:32.840 didn&#x27;t quite get the composition quite\n00:08:34.880 quite right but Uncle William told him\n00:08:38.390 well actually it&#x27;s about the dustbin and\n00:08:42.340 and Bob said okay well how does that\n00:08:44.870 actually work and he said well you know\n00:08:47.930 every day when I when I take this route\n00:08:50.090 he\n00:08:50.720 no to to go to work I look for that\n00:08:53.449 dustbin because when I hit it it tells\n00:08:55.160 me to turn so that I can cross but one\n00:08:59.509 day this cleaner actually moved the\n00:09:01.189 dustbin and I need him to put it back\n00:09:04.389 and Bob realized that sharing his skill\n00:09:11.439 gave him a view into a whole new world\n00:09:14.170 that he was seeing the world with fresh\n00:09:16.759 eyes and with deeper compassion as a\n00:09:19.370 result so maybe you can take photographs\n00:09:23.060 maybe you can cook maybe you can do\n00:09:26.509 accounts maybe you can write stories or\n00:09:29.180 maybe you&#x27;re just a really good\n00:09:30.410 listening ear how could you use your\n00:09:33.949 skill in service of someone else\n00:09:40.810 my friend Wally uses his company and his\n00:09:45.500 voice he&#x27;s a filmmaker and he raises\n00:09:48.649 awareness or he&#x27;s sought to raise\n00:09:50.209 awareness when he&#x27;s not like making\n00:09:53.120 videos of like wedding or weddings or\n00:09:55.040 doing beautiful food photography that he\n00:09:58.670 decided he was going to do something to\n00:10:00.170 combat this this haze which has kind of\n00:10:01.939 been enveloping you know our our whole\n00:10:04.250 our whole region recently and he decided\n00:10:06.740 that instead of just like moaning about\n00:10:08.959 it like most of us that he was actually\n00:10:11.629 going to crowdfund for masks and for air\n00:10:14.779 quality monitors and he was going to go\n00:10:17.930 with volunteers down to Kalimantan to\n00:10:21.259 distribute them and help educate the\n00:10:23.240 local the local people there and he did\n00:10:27.230 this at a time when of course most of us\n00:10:31.220 were just moaning about a 400 you know\n00:10:35.209 pia PM 2.5 and and he told me that when\n00:10:39.439 he went to Kalimantan the monitors\n00:10:41.959 actually didn&#x27;t work but the year but\n00:10:43.459 the app with the actual PM 2.5 levels\n00:10:46.370 there were actually in excess of 2\n00:10:48.050 million society is made better because\n00:10:51.319 of Wally&#x27;s who share their voice Bob&#x27;s\n00:10:54.259 who share their skill and families like\n00:10:57.350 kaho and kauai who teach the next\n00:11:00.529 generation the values of generosity and\n00:11:03.319 the love for human\n00:11:05.680 society is better because of the two\n00:11:07.880 nameless sons of Hana for practicing\n00:11:11.270 their radical love so my dream is to see\n00:11:15.170 all these parts and pieces connected in\n00:11:17.390 a big Network where skills voices funds\n00:11:22.040 ideas are all shared in one place in our\n00:11:24.890 city and what if we were able to\n00:11:28.370 actually create a marketplace where the\n00:11:30.770 whole city comes together and can we\n00:11:33.080 create for our common good\n00:11:35.680 what if neighbors knew what was needed\n00:11:38.180 and that those needs could be met in a\n00:11:41.330 timely in a timely way with available\n00:11:44.300 resources we all have some margin to\n00:11:48.560 spare and to share we all have influence\n00:11:52.040 and voice and we have friends and\n00:11:54.680 colleagues and family members to reach\n00:11:56.870 out to and I believe that we all have\n00:11:59.660 dreams of being lovers of humanity in a\n00:12:03.740 city of good my colleagues and I are now\n00:12:07.760 imagining and trying to build this\n00:12:09.320 giving platform so we can be Wally&#x27;s\n00:12:11.750 Bob&#x27;s or Hannah&#x27;s children or we can\n00:12:14.330 support them with our voice our skills\n00:12:17.390 or our funds as an expression of our\n00:12:19.460 love and we are well aware that\n00:12:22.130 technology is not the solution but\n00:12:24.980 purely an enabler for philanthropy and\n00:12:27.020 acts of love to be expressed so look\n00:12:31.520 around you I think you&#x27;ll see a\n00:12:34.340 philanthropist waiting to be discovered\n00:12:37.510 thank you\n00:12:46.310 you\n", "title": "tactiq-free-transcript-cJ0gl44Q358.txt", "tether_id": null}, "status":

Rubenstein | TEDxPennsylvaniaAvenue\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/C1nCe1vaook\n\n00:00:01.790 [Music]\n00:00:12.240 as well let me tell you my briefly my\n00:00:13.759 story um I&#x27;m from Baltimore um my my\n00:00:17.119 last name is Rubenstein and you think if\n00:00:18.920 name like that you might be somebody who\n00:00:20.880 is from a wealthy family their father is\n00:00:22.519 a doctor lawyer but my father um dropped\n00:00:24.960 out of high school to go into World War\n00:00:26.439 II as part of the Marines came back he\n00:00:28.960 met my mother they got married uh\n00:00:30.840 neither graduated from high school my\n00:00:32.279 father worked in the post office his\n00:00:33.600 entire life made about $7,000 at the\n00:00:35.719 peak so I knew if I was going to get\n00:00:37.640 anywhere I probably had to do it on my\n00:00:39.120 own uh in the sixth grade I heard a\n00:00:41.520 speech that was given not far from here\n00:00:43.719 I watched it on television some of you\n00:00:45.160 may be old enough to remember this\n00:00:46.320 speech was given by John Kennedy and he\n00:00:48.559 said in his famous inaugural address\n00:00:50.039 which was only 14 minutes the greatest\n00:00:51.480 inaugural dress I think of the 20th\n00:00:53.000 century he ask not what your country can\n00:00:54.920 do for you but what you can do for your\n00:00:58.039 country and I that speech my teacher\n00:01:00.960 drilled it into our heads and I just\n00:01:02.239 said okay I want to do something for my\n00:01:03.920 country making money meant nothing to me\n00:01:05.720 my parents had no money I didn&#x27;t think\n00:01:07.240 about making money so I said I want to\n00:01:09.040 do something to help my country so\n00:01:10.720 ultimately I decided the way I could do\n00:01:12.080 it was to go to law school and\n00:01:13.840 ultimately work in government and do\n00:01:15.720 something that might help my country if\n00:01:17.759 I did a good job in government so I got\n00:01:19.640 a scholarship to Duke University I got a\n00:01:21.720 scholarship to univ Chicago law school\n00:01:23.600 and then I went to work in a law firm in\n00:01:25.040 New York that a partner at which was the\n00:01:27.600 man who wrote that speech for John\n00:01:29.119 Kennedy his name was Ted s the greatest\n00:01:30.720 presidential speech writer I think of\n00:01:32.079 all time and after a few years of\n00:01:34.240 working for him um he s of hinted maybe\n00:01:37.000 that I wasn&#x27;t such a great lawyer maybe\n00:01:38.479 I should do something different and I\n00:01:40.560 talked to my clients and I said well you\n00:01:42.200 know I might do something different what\n00:01:43.399 do you think they said now&#x27;s a good time\n00:01:44.680 to leave so I got the idea that I\n00:01:46.680 probably wasn&#x27;t a great lawyer and Ted\n00:01:48.640 saon got me an interview with a man he\n00:01:50.600 said we&#x27; be the next president United\n00:01:51.840 States I could work in the White House\n00:01:53.000 just as he had done for President\n00:01:54.079 Kennedy I got a job as the chief counsel\n00:01:56.200 for a man named burby who was running\n00:01:58.680 for president in 1976\n00:02:00.360 30 days after I joined his um Senate\n00:02:02.600 staff he dropped out of his presidential\n00:02:04.039 campaign so I said uhoh maybe this\n00:02:06.000 happened to some to you as well I wasn&#x27;t\n00:02:08.080 a good lawyer my clients didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:09.479 was good my colleagues didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:10.758 was good I went to join a campaign in\n00:02:13.520 effect it it ended after 30 days and\n00:02:15.560 then I got a call out of the blue some\n00:02:16.879 of you may have in your career as well\n00:02:18.560 it said uh would you like to work for\n00:02:20.519 another man running for president who is\n00:02:22.120 this Jimmy Carter and I said well he&#x27;s\n00:02:23.680 the peanut farmer from Georgia and they\n00:02:25.080 said yes he&#x27;s going to be the nominee\n00:02:26.120 for Democratic party in&#x27; 76 I got the\n00:02:28.000 interview I went down to Georgia Carter\n00:02:30.280 was 33 points ahead when I joined his\n00:02:32.000 campaign he won by one point so he he\n00:02:34.840 often said to me you know what did you\n00:02:36.200 really contribute but White House staffs\n00:02:37.680 are not filled on Merit they&#x27;re filled\n00:02:38.879 on who worked in the campaign so I\n00:02:40.519 became the deputy domestic policy\n00:02:42.040 adviser at the president United States\n00:02:43.280 at the age of 27 three years out of law\n00:02:45.200 school I wasn&#x27;t qualified for that job\n00:02:47.080 he wasn&#x27;t qualified for his job so I\n00:02:48.440 figured we fit in\n00:02:50.400 um I managed to get inflation to 19% in\n00:02:53.680 my job very difficult to get inflation\n00:02:55.560 19% nobody&#x27;s done it since um there was\n00:02:58.280 a rumor that I was going to be promoted\n00:02:59.680 in the second term to be the senior\n00:03:01.200 domestic adviser if Carter&#x27;s reelected\n00:03:03.040 and on the strength of that rumor\n00:03:04.080 President Carter thinks he lost the\n00:03:05.239 election so I had to go find a job I\n00:03:07.400 went back and practice law in Washington\n00:03:08.959 it took me many months to convince\n00:03:10.120 somebody I knew how to do something in\n00:03:11.560 practicing law after finding myself\n00:03:13.920 being humiliated because I was a White\n00:03:15.400 House Aid one day next day I couldn&#x27;t\n00:03:16.680 get a job at practicing law finally\n00:03:18.159 somebody felt sorry for me I practiced\n00:03:19.920 law but once again my client said to me\n00:03:21.959 you know this might not be for you and I\n00:03:24.080 said to my my partners what do you think\n00:03:25.920 about this should I stay and they said\n00:03:27.280 maybe not so I decided I would and I\n00:03:30.200 took a chance I read that on average an\n00:03:31.959 entrepreneur starts a company between\n00:03:33.400 the ages of 28 and 37 and I read that\n00:03:35.599 when I was 37 so I said okay I&#x27;m going\n00:03:38.120 to start a company so without knowing\n00:03:39.959 anything about Finance I decided to\n00:03:41.519 start something called the carw group\n00:03:43.640 and I started in Pennsylvania Avenue I\n00:03:45.280 recruited three people actually knew\n00:03:46.480 something about Finance I told them I\n00:03:48.159 had some money but I really was\n00:03:49.280 exaggerating I told him when they showed\n00:03:51.080 up I would get the money so ultimately\n00:03:53.400 uh we start a company with $5 million\n00:03:55.239 today we manage $200 billion and it&#x27;s\n00:03:57.519 turned out to be one of the largest\n00:03:58.480 private Equity firms in the world when I\n00:04:00.239 hit the age of 54 Forbes Magazine put a\n00:04:02.879 story out about my net worth and my\n00:04:04.599 partner&#x27;s net worth and it became\n00:04:05.920 obvious to me that I had made so much\n00:04:07.920 money that I couldn&#x27;t possibly spend it\n00:04:09.599 on on houses and planes and boats and so\n00:04:12.319 forth which I didn&#x27;t really care much\n00:04:13.720 about anyway so I decided what I would\n00:04:15.400 try to do is atone for my sins getting\n00:04:17.399 inflation to 19% and maybe give it back\n00:04:19.759 to the UN government give back to the US\n00:04:21.560 government give back to my country but I\n00:04:23.160 wasn&#x27;t sure how to do it and it came\n00:04:24.520 about in a kind of U unusual way one day\n00:04:27.600 I was invited to an uh an auction in in\n00:04:29.800 New York I was told I would be able to\n00:04:31.360 see the Magna Carta and I said how can\n00:04:33.440 you see the Magna Carta it&#x27;s in England\n00:04:34.720 it turned out there are 17 copies of the\n00:04:36.560 Magna Carta and I had a chance to to see\n00:04:38.960 one of them it was the only one in\n00:04:40.080 private hands I decided that I would try\n00:04:41.919 to buy that and make sure it stayed in\n00:04:43.360 the United States because it was\n00:04:44.280 probably going to be auctioned off I was\n00:04:45.440 told by the auctioneer and leave the\n00:04:47.000 country so I went back that next night I\n00:04:49.039 bought it and I now put it on display at\n00:04:50.880 the National Archives it&#x27;ll be there\n00:04:52.080 permanently and I said I&#x27;ll do this for\n00:04:53.759 the for the country is a way to kind of\n00:04:55.440 make sure this document which was the\n00:04:56.880 inspiration for the Declaration of\n00:04:58.080 Independence the Bill of Rights the\n00:04:59.680 Constitution stays here and then other\n00:05:01.479 documents came available the declaration\n00:05:03.199 independence the Emancipation\n00:05:04.360 Proclamation the 13th Amendment which\n00:05:05.800 Freeds slaves the Constitution the Bill\n00:05:07.720 of Rights and I bought rare copies of\n00:05:09.400 them and put them on display at the\n00:05:10.600 state department the national\n00:05:12.320 Constitution Center the Smithsonian the\n00:05:14.120 library Congress as a way of saying to\n00:05:16.240 Americans take a look at these and learn\n00:05:17.919 more about your history in a recent Pew\n00:05:19.800 survey it turned out that 35% of\n00:05:21.840 Americans when they asked what river did\n00:05:23.160 George washingon cross during the\n00:05:24.440 Revolutionary War said the Rin River not\n00:05:27.039 that&#x27;s not true 33% of Americans when\n00:05:29.479 they asked who was the first treasury\n00:05:30.720 secretary didn&#x27;t know it was Alexander\n00:05:32.479 hamilt and they said it was Larry\n00:05:33.479 Summers so my theory is Americans don&#x27;t\n00:05:35.600 know enough about their history and you\n00:05:36.759 can be a better uh citizen if you know\n00:05:38.759 more about your history so I&#x27;m trying to\n00:05:39.960 buy these historic documents and put\n00:05:41.720 them on display make sure people know\n00:05:43.520 more about history as a way of\n00:05:44.880 introducing them to our history another\n00:05:46.840 thing happened by S tippity as well one\n00:05:48.639 time I was at the keny center and the\n00:05:50.919 man on the board was the head of the\n00:05:52.160 Park Service he told me that Washington\n00:05:53.520 Monument had suffered earthquake damage\n00:05:55.199 I told him I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll put\n00:05:56.639 up the money just ignore the government\n00:05:58.280 and the usual constraints forget\n00:05:59.680 Congress tell me how much it cost I&#x27;ll\n00:06:01.199 put up the money to fix it so he did he\n00:06:02.800 later came back and said Congress wanted\n00:06:04.039 to share the credit because they weren&#x27;t\n00:06:05.560 getting a lot of good credit so they\n00:06:06.560 said can they put up half the money I\n00:06:07.840 said okay so I just put up the money to\n00:06:10.199 repair the Washington Monument some of\n00:06:11.599 you may have seen the scaffolding there\n00:06:12.960 from time to time and then I came up\n00:06:14.520 with the idea that well that was a good\n00:06:15.960 idea but why not fix other historic\n00:06:17.800 things so I decided to help fix up\n00:06:20.000 monachello Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s home mon\n00:06:22.000 peer James Madison&#x27;s home Mount Vernon\n00:06:24.039 George Washington&#x27;s home the custus Lee\n00:06:25.840 Mansion at the top of Arlington and some\n00:06:27.639 other things that I&#x27;ll announce uh down\n00:06:29.120 the road and so what I&#x27;ve decided to do\n00:06:30.680 is to fix these historic buildings in\n00:06:33.000 part because I want to remind Americans\n00:06:34.319 of their history and try to do what I&#x27;m\n00:06:35.960 now called patriotic philanthropy which\n00:06:37.680 means giving back to your country and\n00:06:39.599 all of us have probably been benefited\n00:06:41.720 from this country more than we might\n00:06:43.039 think if I had grown up with my last\n00:06:44.639 name and with my modest means in another\n00:06:46.479 country I don&#x27;t think I would have been\n00:06:47.520 able to do what I&#x27;ve been able to do so\n00:06:49.080 I want to dedicate my life now to giving\n00:06:51.360 back to the country I assigned the\n00:06:52.720 giving pledge I was the only person in\n00:06:54.039 the private Equity industry and the and\n00:06:55.919 one of the first 40 people that signed\n00:06:57.440 the giving pledge which says you&#x27;re\n00:06:58.360 going to give away half your money but\n00:06:59.759 I&#x27;ve decided to give away all my money\n00:07:01.400 on the theory that my children really\n00:07:02.759 aren&#x27;t going to be benefiting from all\n00:07:04.080 this money now they may not agree with\n00:07:05.560 that completely but um there&#x27;s no\n00:07:08.160 evidence that people that inherit $500\n00:07:09.879 million go on to win a Nobel Peace Prize\n00:07:11.759 were doing something wonderful usually\n00:07:13.319 the people who do great things in the\n00:07:14.520 Life are people that don&#x27;t inherit\n00:07:16.560 enormous sums of money there&#x27;s obviously\n00:07:18.520 exceptions but but I thought that my\n00:07:20.160 kids would be better off if they really\n00:07:21.840 had the modest means uh going along it\n00:07:24.039 that I had and give them more drive so\n00:07:26.199 I&#x27;m trying to give away my money in ways\n00:07:27.720 that say to the country thank you thank\n00:07:30.039 you for what you&#x27;ve done but I try to\n00:07:31.400 remind people you don&#x27;t need to be\n00:07:33.520 wealthy to be a philanthropist you don&#x27;t\n00:07:34.919 need to be wealthy to help your country\n00:07:36.479 philanthropy is an ancient Greek word\n00:07:38.080 that means loving Humanity it doesn&#x27;t\n00:07:39.599 say rich people writing checks so you\n00:07:41.360 can give your time your your energy your\n00:07:43.720 ideas whatever it it might be you can be\n00:07:46.080 a great philanthropist I think Wendy cop\n00:07:48.199 who created Teach for America she didn&#x27;t\n00:07:49.800 have a lot of money but she created that\n00:07:51.360 that organization which has helped\n00:07:52.440 America a great deal and she&#x27;s a great\n00:07:54.159 philanthropist in my view I don&#x27;t like\n00:07:56.039 it when you see the great list of\n00:07:57.599 philanthropists and it only lists how\n00:07:58.800 much money they&#x27;ve given not how much\n00:08:00.360 time or energy or ideas they might have\n00:08:01.840 given to the country but think back on\n00:08:03.759 this uh all of you uh what have you done\n00:08:06.840 to help your country all of you probably\n00:08:08.360 have come from different backgrounds but\n00:08:09.800 all of you have benefited from the the\n00:08:11.720 freedoms and the rights and that this\n00:08:13.759 country has now we&#x27;re not a perfect\n00:08:15.120 country for sure we&#x27;ve struggled for\n00:08:16.800 many years to get certain rights and we\n00:08:18.400 still don&#x27;t have all these rights but\n00:08:20.039 still it&#x27;s an extraordinary country and\n00:08:22.080 it&#x27;s going to be made even more\n00:08:23.319 extraordinary if we get citizens to want\n00:08:24.879 to give back to the country not just\n00:08:26.720 take from the country so in my modest\n00:08:28.639 means when I&#x27;m trying to do is to say I\n00:08:30.560 will buy historic documents make sure\n00:08:32.440 that people see them and that they&#x27;re\n00:08:34.000 part of our country&#x27;s history forever\n00:08:35.958 and and people can see them all the time\n00:08:37.719 whenever they want to see them and learn\n00:08:38.839 more about history keep fix up our\n00:08:40.640 historic monuments not because they&#x27;re\n00:08:42.159 the most important things in our country\n00:08:43.519 there are many more important things but\n00:08:45.320 it&#x27;s a way of saying this symbolic uh\n00:08:47.800 representation of our country is worth\n00:08:49.440 your knowing about it learn more about\n00:08:51.160 the history of George Washington Thomas\n00:08:52.680 Jefferson James Madison the founding\n00:08:54.399 fathers because if you do so you can be\n00:08:56.080 a better informed citizen now if you&#x27;re\n00:08:58.040 selfish you could say to yourself why\n00:08:59.800 should I be a philanthropist why should\n00:09:01.560 I give back why don&#x27;t I just give money\n00:09:03.240 to myself and buy homes well think about\n00:09:05.320 this the great philanthropists live a\n00:09:06.959 long time so you could look at it\n00:09:08.480 selfishly John D Rockefeller lived to be\n00:09:10.640 97 David Rockefeller just turned 100 I\n00:09:13.279 have a theory that God looks favorably\n00:09:15.000 on people who give away their\n00:09:16.600 money he keeps them on Earth for a long\n00:09:19.120 time so no philanthropist drops dead\n00:09:21.560 very quickly so if you&#x27;re just selfish\n00:09:23.519 about it if you want to live a long time\n00:09:25.480 give away your money or give away your\n00:09:26.880 time your energy your ideas because I\n00:09:28.519 think there&#x27;s a very good thing uh uh\n00:09:31.360 that&#x27;s likely to await you now I do have\n00:09:33.160 a theory that not only will you live a\n00:09:34.560 long time but there&#x27;s a special place in\n00:09:36.640 heaven reserved for people that do\n00:09:38.839 philanthropy now I can&#x27;t prove that but\n00:09:41.279 why would you want to take a chance\n00:09:43.519 right so it&#x27;s very important I think in\n00:09:47.200 this country that people should learn\n00:09:49.560 more about the history of the country\n00:09:51.480 learn more about how we&#x27;ve got where we\n00:09:53.560 are the mistakes we made so that we can\n00:09:55.320 avoid repeating these mistakes and I\n00:09:57.440 think everybody here should look back\n00:09:59.160 and what they&#x27;re doing with their life\n00:10:01.079 you&#x27;re only on this Earth for a very\n00:10:02.959 short period of time you if you&#x27;re lucky\n00:10:05.120 80 years 85 years 90 years if you&#x27;re\n00:10:07.519 very lucky but and that&#x27;s a very short\n00:10:10.120 span of time really when you consider\n00:10:11.839 that humans have been on the earth for\n00:10:12.959 maybe a million years or so and you&#x27;re\n00:10:14.519 going to be here for a short period of\n00:10:15.760 time don&#x27;t get to your deathbed and say\n00:10:18.079 I wish I had done something to help my\n00:10:19.680 country I wish I had done something to\n00:10:21.399 help my community do it when you&#x27;re\n00:10:22.920 younger don&#x27;t wait till you&#x27;re 54 years\n00:10:24.519 old don&#x27;t wait till you do the kind of\n00:10:26.560 things I did do it younger and make it\n00:10:28.760 part of your DNA and I think if we can\n00:10:30.880 do that and we can get young people to\n00:10:32.279 do this and we can get people to get\n00:10:33.560 their children to do it the country will\n00:10:35.079 be a better place very often we take for\n00:10:37.320 granted the great rights and freedoms\n00:10:39.200 this country has given us while it&#x27;s not\n00:10:41.480 a perfect country it&#x27;s a better country\n00:10:43.279 in my view than any other country with\n00:10:44.720 the freedoms and rights and the\n00:10:45.839 opportunities we have and so I think we\n00:10:47.639 should do something to say thank you to\n00:10:49.120 the country from time to time not in an\n00:10:50.920 unduly patriotic way not in a way that\n00:10:53.279 makes patriotism something that is\n00:10:55.519 something you can hide behind but\n00:10:57.079 something that you&#x27;re not afraid of of\n00:10:59.519 being patriotic I&#x27;m not afraid of saying\n00:11:01.279 I&#x27;m a patriotic philanthropist I&#x27;m\n00:11:03.079 giving back to the country because I&#x27;m\n00:11:04.560 proud of being an American I&#x27;m proud\n00:11:06.279 that I was able to do what I&#x27;m able to\n00:11:07.519 do and I&#x27;m proud the country made it\n00:11:09.200 possible for me to do this so all of you\n00:11:11.360 as you think about what you&#x27;re doing\n00:11:12.560 with your life think about what more you\n00:11:14.480 might be able to do if you just spent a\n00:11:16.440 little time giving back to the country\n00:11:18.279 in some modest way it doesn&#x27;t have to be\n00:11:19.959 rep repairing a monument or buying a\n00:11:21.480 document but just something that you can\n00:11:23.279 do that you can say later in life or\n00:11:26.000 even now yes I&#x27;ve done something to give\n00:11:27.880 back to my country and yes have done\n00:11:29.680 something to make the world a slightly\n00:11:31.040 better place all of us on this Earth for\n00:11:33.040 periods of time that are relatively\n00:11:34.360 short as I mentioned nobody knows why\n00:11:36.440 we&#x27;re really here but presumably we&#x27;re\n00:11:38.200 here to make the wood a slightly better\n00:11:39.680 place and we shouldn&#x27;t wait until the\n00:11:41.639 end of our life and say uh oh I better\n00:11:43.320 do something for the next last five\n00:11:44.800 years of my life do it earlier and don&#x27;t\n00:11:47.279 don&#x27;t hesitate to do so and don&#x27;t worry\n00:11:49.560 only about your career worry about\n00:11:51.279 helping the country as well

Describe why these are important and relate and apply the three dimensions to your learning from earlier modules.\n\nAccording to Onat et al. (2017), three key dimensions of improvement are suggested to enhance the effectiveness of sustainability assessments. These dimensions include the integration of environmental, economic, and social dimensions, the application of systems thinking, and the active engagement of stakeholders. Each of these elements is vital for constructing a holistic and practical approach to sustainability that transcends the limitations often imposed by capitalist systems, which prioritize profit at the expense of environmental and social equity.\nThe overall approach to sustainability presented by Onat et al. (2017) emphasizes the necessity of considering the environmental, economic, and social impacts of products or services throughout their lifecycle. It contrasts and challenges the capitalist tendency to focus solely on economic gains by highlighting the interconnectedness of these dimensions. Ignoring these aspects can lead to solutions that appear beneficial in one area but are detrimental in others.\n\nSystems thinking requires understanding the complete lifecycle of a product or service\u2014from raw material extraction to disposal\u2014and identifying potential impacts at each stage. This method helps pinpoint critical points for intervention and prevents unintended consequences from changes made in isolation. One can see the links between systems thinking and the ideas presented by Ostrum (1997),  which expands the rational choice models to incorporate collective actions that better address complex social dilemmas. It challenges simplistic, linear thinking\u2014common in capitalist approaches\u2014that often overlook long-term consequences for immediate profit.\nFinally, engaging stakeholders across a product or service lifecycle ensures that the diverse values and needs of different groups are considered and addressed in the sustainability assessment process. This approach is crucial for democratizing decision-making processes, which often are controlled top-down in capitalist structures. Fisher\u2019s (2020) discussions on how system dynamics modeling can involve stakeholders in understanding and managing complex systems effectively provide a solid argument for stakeholder engagement across the lifecycle. \nBy applying these three dimensions to the broader discussions from earlier modules, it becomes evident how these principles can help counteract the equity and sustainability challenges exacerbated by capitalist systems. These dimensions advocate for a more inclusive, holistic, and long-term approach to sustainability that aligns with social equity and environmental stewardship rather than focusing narrowly on immediate economic outcomes. This integrated approach critiques and actively challenges the inequities perpetuated by capitalist systems, paving the way for more sustainable and equitable global practices.\n\n\nPart 2: \n\nWhat indicators are required to assess the systems dynamics of flow-limited resources? \n\n\nA systems dynamics model must incorporate several key indicators to effectively assess the dynamics of flow-limited resources within a system. These indicators include stocks, flows, converters/constants, and information flows, each playing a crucial role in understanding and predicting system behaviors.\nStocks represent the resources available within the system at any given time. These could be tangible elements like water in a reservoir or abstract quantities such as carbon or even a population count in an ecological study. Stocks are foundational for monitoring resource levels and serve as a baseline for measuring changes over time (Reuter, 2013)\nFlows describe the movement of resources between stocks or from external sources into the system. This includes inputs and outputs measured over specific time intervals, such as liters of water per hour or tons of carbon per year. Understanding flows is critical for assessing how resources are utilized and replenished within the system, providing insights into sustainability and efficiency (Reuter, 2013).\nConverters/constants are parameters within the model that affect flows or stocks but remain unchanged regardless of system dynamics. These could include growth rate constants, conversion efficiencies, or fixed loss rates, which are essential for stabilizing the model and making accurate predictions (Reuter, 2013).\nInformation flows represent the non-material connections that influence system components by altering flows or converters based on the state of stocks or other variables. This aspect of systems dynamics is crucial for modeling feedback mechanisms and adaptive behaviors within the system, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how changes in one part of the system can ripple through to others (Reuter, 2013).\nIntegrating these components into a systems dynamics model allows for a comprehensive view of how resources are interlinked and governed by various dynamic factors. This holistic approach is vital for predicting future system states under different scenarios and making informed resource management and conservation decisions.\n\n\nWhat inputs might be incorporated into a model of flow-limited resources? How is this different from stock-limited resources? \n\nIn resource management, two distinct modeling approaches are used to predict and understand resource availability and sustainability: flow-limited and stock-limited models.\nFlow-limited models focus on the dynamics of resource renewal and consumption. These models consider key inputs like the rate at which a resource regenerates, whether naturally or through human efforts. They also analyze the consumption rate to see how quickly various entities or processes are using the resource. Additionally, factors like environmental conditions, regulatory policies, and technological changes play significant roles in influencing resource availability and flow. This dynamic model adapts to changes in usage patterns and replenishment strategies, providing a flexible framework for forecasting future resource statuses (Reuter, 2013).\nIn contrast, stock-limited models are concerned with the finite resources available. They focus on the absolute amount of the resource that exists or can be accessed, such as fossil fuels or minerals. These models consider extraction or harvest rates, detailing how quickly the resource is depleted over time. They also evaluate the resource\u2019s regeneration capabilities, whether it can be naturally replenished or artificially sustained over long periods. This approach emphasizes the depletion of a fixed stock, highlighting the limits of availability and the critical need for conservation and efficient use (Reuter, 2013).\nThe main difference between these two models lies in their focus and application. Flow-limited models are dynamic, reflecting continuous changes in resource flows and the effects of various influencing factors. They are particularly useful when resources can be renewed or are affected by external conditions. On the other hand, stock-limited models deal with resources that have fixed availability, concentrating on managing finite supplies and preventing exhaustion. Understanding these differences is crucial for policymakers, businesses, and conservationists. It helps develop effective resource management strategies, ensure sustainability, and tackle the challenges posed by limited natural resources (Fisher, 2020).\n\nProvide an example of the systems dynamics of:\nA stock-limited resource (such as cobalt)\nA flow-limited resource (such as rabbits)\nDescribe what and how you would measure the inputs, outputs, and feedback loops (in-flow, out-flow, connectors or dependencies, stocks, and sources or sinks) in each example. Keep it simple (i.e., bamboo production for chairs). You don\u2019t have to do the mathematical calculations, just describe the systems process. (If you want to take it further, you can use Stella Online Modeling, linked above).\nIn the context of a stock-limited resource, such as a clean freshwater source in Italy, the freshwater stock represents the available clean water.  The inflows consist of precipitation, river inflow, and groundwater recharge. Outflows include water extraction for agriculture, industry, and domestic use, as well as evaporation and natural seepage. These elements create a dynamic system where the feedback loops of regeneration and depletion play significant roles. Regeneration feedback pertains to the natural processes that replenish water, such as rainfall and groundwater recharge, whereas depletion feedback involves the extraction and loss of water through various means (Terzi et al., 2021).\n\n\nSeveral factors influence connectors and dependencies within this system. Population growth directly affects water demand, as more people lead to higher water usage. Climate conditions, such as variations in precipitation and evaporation rates, also significantly impact water availability. Additionally, agricultural practices, particularly those involving crops with high water demands, increase the outflows. Regulatory policies, including water usage restrictions, can mitigate some of these impacts by controlling the outflows. Measuring the system involves tracking precipitation rates, river inflow, and groundwater recharge as inputs. At the same time, outputs include the volumes of water extracted for different uses and the rates of evaporation and natural seepage. Monitoring these variables helps understand the patterns of water regeneration and depletion, enabling effective resource management (Zingaro et al., 2017). \n\n\nFor a flow-limited resource like olive oil, the system dynamics model involves several interacting components that represent the dynamics of olive production and consumption. The olive stock indicates the quantity of olives available for processing into olive oil. The harvesting of olives represents the inflows, while the outflows encompass the production, export, and consumption of olive oil. Feedback loops, such as production and consumption feedback, reflect how the processing of olives into oil and the subsequent consumption impact the demand. Various connectors and dependencies influence this system, including seasonal growth affected by climatic conditions, market demand driving production rates and prices, agricultural practices affecting olive yield and quality, and economic policies like trade policies and subsidies that influence production and export rates (Jeong &amp; Adamowski, 2016).\n\nTo measure this system, inputs include quantifying the harvested olives, while outputs measure the volume of olive oil produced, exported, and consumed. Feedback loops are monitored by assessing olive tree health and yield to predict future harvests, tracking market prices and demand to adjust production levels, and evaluating the impact of agricultural practices on yield and quality. This comprehensive understanding of inputs, outputs, and feedback loops is essential for managing the production process effectively and ensuring sustainable practices in olive oil production (Kotir et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n\nDiana Fisher (Director).

Keep it simple (i.e., bamboo production for chairs). You don\u2019t have to do the mathematical calculations, just describe the systems process. (If you want to take it further, you can use Stella Online Modeling, linked above).\nStock-Limited Resource: Clean Fresh Water Source in Italy\nThe system dynamics components include stocks such as the fresh water stock, representing the clean fresh water available in a source, and flows including inflow (precipitation, river inflow, groundwater recharge) and outflow (water extraction for agriculture, industry, and domestic use, evaporation, natural seepage).\n  \nPossible feedback loops related to water stock includes regeneration feedback, which pertains to the rate at which the water stock is replenished by natural processes such as rainfall and groundwater recharge, as well as the depletion feedback, which concerns the rate at which water is extracted or lost through evaporation and seepage.  \n\n\nThe system has several connectors and dependencies that play crucial roles. Population growth directly affects water demand, as an increase in the number of people leads to higher water usage. Climate conditions also have a significant impact, influencing precipitation and evaporation rates. Furthermore, agricultural practices, particularly those involving high-water-demand crops, contribute to increased outflow. Regulatory policies, such as water usage restrictions, can directly affect outflows as well.\n\nIn terms of measurement, the system involves tracking various inputs and outputs. Precipitation rates, river inflow, and groundwater recharge rates are measured as inputs, while water extraction volumes for agriculture, industry, and domestic use, as well as evaporation rates and natural seepage rates, are measured as outputs. Additionally, feedback loops are essential components of the system, involving the monitoring of changes in water levels over time to understand regeneration and depletion patterns. Furthermore, the impact of regulatory policies on water usage and stock levels is analyzed to ensure effective management of the system.\n\n2. Flow-Limited Resource: Olive Oil\n\nIn the system dynamics model, we have various components that interact to represent the dynamics of olive production and consumption. The &quot;Olive Stock&quot; signifies the amount of olives available for processing into olive oil, while the &quot;Inflow&quot; and &quot;Outflow&quot; represent the harvesting of olives and the production, export, and consumption of olive oil, respectively. Feedback loops such as &quot;Production Feedback&quot; and &quot;Consumption Feedback&quot; reflect the rates at which olives are processed into oil and the consumption of olive oil impacting demand. Additionally, there are connectors and dependencies including &quot;Seasonal Growth&quot; affected by climatic conditions, &quot;Market Demand&quot; influencing production rates and prices, &quot;Agricultural Practices&quot; impacting olive yield and quality, and &quot;Economic Policies&quot; such as trade policies and subsidies influencing production and export rates. To measure the system, inputs involve quantifying the quantity of olives harvested, while outputs include measuring the volume of olive oil produced, exported, and consumed. Feedback loops are employed to monitor olive tree health and yield for predicting future harvests, track market prices and demand to adjust production levels, and assess the impact of agricultural practices on olive yield and quality.For both resources, it is crucial to measure and monitor the inputs (natural replenishment for water, olive harvest for oil), outputs (water extraction, olive oil production), and feedback loops (natural regeneration for water, production and consumption cycles for oil). By understanding these dynamics, effective management and sustainable practices can be implemented to ensure the longevity and availability of these resources.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "888853880e720e77-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8b1d6ceb-3dc2-4418-873c-e4a19937b915", "children": ["4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c"]}, "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c": {"id": "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c", "message": {"id": "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716501707.336934, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "json", "response_format_name": null, "text": "{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;system dynamics modeling of water resources in Italy&quot;, &quot;year_min&quot;: 2010}"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200007]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa21302-d27e-4f82-8d80-b07271e636ee", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "888853880e720e77-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa21302-d27e-4f82-8d80-b07271e636ee", "children": ["a158b842-01da-4cf2-b193-1b3e6a7ee487"]}, "a158b842-01da-4cf2-b193-1b3e6a7ee487": {"id": "a158b842-01da-4cf2-b193-1b3e6a7ee487", "message": {"id": "a158b842-01da-4cf2-b193-1b3e6a7ee487", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716501707.33858, "update_time": 1716501707.3109922, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"jit_plugin_data": {"from_server": {"type": "confirm_action", "body": {"domain": "chat.consensus.app", "is_consequential": false, "privacy_policy": "https://consensus.app/home/privacy-policy/", "method": "get", "path": "/quick_search", "operation": "search_papers", "params": {"query": "system dynamics modeling of water resources in Italy", "year_min": 2010}, "actions": [{"name": "allow", "type": "allow", "allow": {"target_message_id": "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c"}}, {"type": "always_allow", "always_allow": {"target_message_id": "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c", "operation_hash": "ef26f5766b50deb71a60a99083acf4c086e7a67f"}}, {"name": "decline", "type": "deny", "deny": {"target_message_id": "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c"}}]}}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c", "request_id": "888853880e720e77-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "assistant", "channel": null}, "parent": "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c", "children": ["7c9d8363-ca6f-44e6-8618-0ba99fdc1585"]}, "7c9d8363-ca6f-44e6-8618-0ba99fdc1585": {"id": "7c9d8363-ca6f-44e6-8618-0ba99fdc1585", "message": {"id": "7c9d8363-ca6f-44e6-8618-0ba99fdc1585", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716501726.420455, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"jit_plugin_data": {"from_client": {"type": "allow", "target_message_id": "4e056930-7524-49c6-912c-e79356c2670c"}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "request_id": "8888540c4c7c0e77-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a158b842-01da-4cf2-b193-1b3e6a7ee487", "children": ["57a4b0bc-61c6-4b0b-aca0-7cb963fb2fa9"]}, "57a4b0bc-61c6-4b0b-aca0-7cb963fb2fa9": {"id": "57a4b0bc-61c6-4b0b-aca0-7cb963fb2fa9", "message": {"id": "57a4b0bc-61c6-4b0b-aca0-7cb963fb2fa9", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716501763.70805, "update_time": 1716501728.1207922, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{&quot;items&quot;:[{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;A system dynamics simulation model for sustainable water resources management and agricultural development in the Volta River Basin, Ghana.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;In a rapidly changing water resources system, dynamic models based on the notion of systems thinking can serve as useful analytical tools for scientists and policy-makers to study changes in key system variables over time. In this paper, an integrated system dynamics simulation model was developed using a system dynamics modelling approach to examine the feedback processes and interaction between the population, the water resource, and the agricultural production sub-sectors of the Volta River Basin in West Africa. The objective of the model is to provide a learning tool for policy-makers to improve their understanding of the long-term dynamic behaviour of the basin, and as a decision support tool for exploring plausible policy scenarios necessary for sustainable water resource management and agricultural development. Structural and behavioural pattern tests, and statistical test were used to evaluate and validate the performance of the model. The results showed that the simulated outputs agreed well with the observed reality of the system. A sensitivity analysis also indicated that the model is reliable and robust to uncertainties in the major parameters. Results of the business as usual scenario showed that total population, agricultural, domestic, and industrial water demands will continue to increase over the simulated period. Besides business as usual, three additional policy scenarios were simulated to assess their impact on water demands, crop yield, and net-farm income. These were the development of the water infrastructure (scenario 1), cropland expansion (scenario 2) and dry conditions (scenario 3). The results showed that scenario 1 would provide the maximum benefit to people living in the basin. Overall, the model results could help inform planning and investment decisions within the basin to enhance food security, livelihoods development, socio-economic growth, and sustainable management of natural resources.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

The model aims at evaluating the impact of some drivers (mainly the water cost) on water resources management and groundwater conservation at the district scale. The model is part of a Decision Support System (DSS) developed to investigate the main dynamics in an agricultural district, integrating in a model based on System Dynamics specific sub-modules (e.g. Crop Water Demand, Surface Reservoir Balance, Groundwater Balance and Farmers\u2019 Behavioural Model). Semi-structured interviews were carried out with local stakeholders in order to define (i) the relationship between the irrigation source selection and the water tariff applied in the irrigation district, and (ii) the selection of groundwater, based on cost, to fulfil the irrigation needs. The volumes from surface water were evaluated during the model calibration phase according to the expected irrigation needs, and found to be significantly correlated to the water stock in the reservoir well before the start of the irrigation season. The validation phase showed a good agreement between measured and simulated reservoir irrigation uptakes in the period 2000\u20132012. It was mainly shown that the preference for a water source depends mainly on the ratio between the surface water tariff and the groundwater pumping cost at farm-scale. The results also demonstrated that a restrictive water tariff policy applied during drought periods produced a marked increase in the groundwater use instead of reducing the water-irrigation consumption. Globally the model allows to better describe the drivers influencing farmers\u2019 behaviour and, thus, supports assessing the impacts of water policies, such as those related to water tariff.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;D.

Water management in mountain regions is facing multiple pressures due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. This is particularly relevant\\nfor mountain areas where water abundance in the past allowed for many anthropogenic activities, exposing them to future water scarcity. Here\\nstochastic system dynamics modelling (SDM) was implemented to explore water scarcity conditions affecting the stored water and turbined outflows in\\nthe Santa Giustina (S.\u00a0Giustina) reservoir (Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy). The analysis relies on a model chain integrating outputs from climate change simulations\\ninto a hydrological model, the output of which was used to test and select statistical models in an SDM for replicating turbined water and stored volume\\nwithin the S.\u00a0Giustina dam reservoir. The study aims at simulating future conditions of the S.\u00a0Giustina reservoir in terms of outflow and\\nvolume as well as implementing a set of metrics to analyse volume extreme conditions. Average results on 30-year slices of simulations show that even under the short-term RCP4.5 scenario (2021\u20132050) future reductions for stored\\nvolume and turbined outflow are expected to be severe compared to the 14-year baseline (1999\u20132004 and 2009\u20132016; \u221224.9\u2009% of turbined\\noutflow and \u221219.9\u2009% of stored volume). Similar reductions are expected also for the long-term RCP8.5 scenario (2041\u20132070; \u221226.2\u2009% of\\nturbined outflow and \u221220.8\u2009% of stored volume), mainly driven by the projected precipitations having a similar but lower trend especially in\\nthe last part of the 2041\u20132070 period. At a monthly level, stored volume and turbined outflow are expected to increase for December to March (outflow\\nonly), January to April (volume only) depending on scenarios and up to +32.5\u2009% of stored volume in March for RCP8.5 for 2021\u20132050. Reductions are\\npersistently occurring for the rest of the year from April to November for turbined outflows (down to \u221256.3\u2009% in August) and from May to\\nDecember for stored volume (down to \u221244.1\u2009% in June). Metrics of frequency, duration and severity of future stored volume values suggest a\\ngeneral increase in terms of low volume below the 10th and 20th percentiles and a decrease of high-volume conditions above the 80th and 90th\\npercentiles. These results point at higher percentage increases in frequency and severity for values below the 10th percentile, while volume\\nvalues below the 20th percentile are expected to last longer. Above the 90th percentile, values are expected to be less frequent than baseline\\nconditions, while showing smaller severity reductions compared to values above the 80th percentile. These results call for the adoption of\\nadaptation strategies focusing on water demand reductions. Months of expected increases in water availability should be considered periods for\\nwater accumulation while preparing for potential persistent reductions of stored water and turbined outflows. This study provides results and\\nmethodological insights that can be used for future SDM upscaling to integrate different strategic mountain socio-economic sectors (e.g.\\nhydropower, agriculture and tourism) and prepare for potential multi-risk conditions.\\n&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Stefano Terzi&quot;,&quot;J.

Nevertheless, in situations with inadequate information, such as ungauged basins, a balance between model complexity and data availability is necessary. In this paper, we applied a simplified analytical model to an artificially drained floodplain in central-western Italy to evaluate the importance of different nutrient sources and in-stream retention processes and to identify critical source areas. We first considered only a set of chemical concentrations in water measured from February through May 2008 and from November 2008 through February 2009. We then broadened available data to include water discharge and hydraulic-head measurements to construct a hydrogeological model using MODFLOW-2000 and to evaluate the reliability of the simplified method. The simplified model provided acceptable estimates of discharge (ranging from 0.03-0.75 m s) and diffuse nutrient inputs from water table discharge and in-stream retention phenomena. Estimates of PO-P and total P retention (ranging from 1.0 to 0.6 \u03bcg m s and from 1.18 to 0.95 \u03bcg m s for PO-P and total P, respectively) were consistent with the range of variability in literature data. In contrast, the higher temporal variability of nitrate concentrations decreased model accuracy, suggesting the need for more intensive monitoring. The model also separated the dynamics of different reaches of the drainage network and identified zones considered critical source areas and buffer zones where pollutant transport is reduced.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

In this study, after identifying lake watershed system processes, we developed a system dynamics modeling framework for managing lake water quality at the watershed scale. Two reinforcing loops (Development and Investment Promotion) and three balancing loops (Pollution, Resource Consumption, and Pollution Control) were constituted. Based on this work, we constructed Stock and Flow Diagrams that embedded a pollutant load model and a lake water quality model into a socioeconomic system dynamics model. The Dianchi Lake in Yunnan Province, China, which is the sixth largest and among the most severely polluted freshwater lakes in China, was employed as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Water quality parameters considered in the model included chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). The business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and three alternative management scenarios on spatial adjustment of industries and population (S1), wastewater treatment capacity construction (S2), and structural adjustment of agriculture (S3), were simulated to assess the effectiveness of certain policies in improving water quality.

System Dynamics (SD) has in turn become increasingly popular due to its advantages as a tool for dealing with such complex systems. However, SD also has some limitations. This review contains a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on SD as a potential method to deal with the complexity of system integrated modeling, with a particular focus on the application of SD to the integrated modeling of water resources systems. It discusses the limitations of SD in these contexts, and highlights a number of studies which have applied a combination of SD and other methods to overcome these limitations. Finally, our study makes a number of recommendations for future modifications in the application of SD methods in order to enhance their performance.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

Water management in mountain regions is facing multiple pressures due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. This is particularly relevant for mountain areas where water abundance in the past allowed for many anthropogenic activities, exposing them to future water scarcity. To better understand the processes involved in water scarcity impact, an innovative stochastic System Dynamics Modelling (SDM) explores water stored and turbined in the S.Giustina reservoir (Province of Trento, Italy). The integration of outputs from climate change simulations as well as from a hydrological model and statistical models into the SDM is a quick and effective tool to simulate past and future water availability and demand conditions. Short-term RCP4.5 simulations depict conditions of highest volume and outflow reductions starting in spring (\u221216.1\u2009% and \u221244.7\u2009% in May compared to the baseline). Long-term RCP8.5 simulations suggest conditions of volume and outflow reductions starting in summer and lasting until the end of the year. The number of events with stored water below the 30th and above the 80th quantiles suggest a general reduction both in terms of low and high volumes. These results call for the need to adapt to acute short-term water availability reductions in spring and summer while preparing for hydroelectric production reductions due to the chronic long-term trends affecting autumn and mid-winter. This study provides results and methodological insights for potential SDM upscaling across strategic mountain socio-economic sectors (e.g., hydropower, agriculture and tourism) to expand water scarcity assessments and prepare for future multi-risk conditions and impacts.\\n&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Stefano Terzi&quot;,&quot;J.

The emphasis is on the application of generic simulation models to a multi-reservoir and multi-use water system in Southern Italy where frequent droughts over the last two decades have necessitated the use of temporary and unsustainable user-supply restrictions. In particular, AQUATOOL (Valencia Polytechnic University), MODSIM (Colorado State University), RIBASIM (DELTARES), WARGI-SIM (University of Cagliari) and WEAP (Stockholm Environmental Institute) models are considered in a preliminary analysis, which considers series and parallel simple schemes and also evaluates the possibility of alternative plans and operating policies in complex real water system. Each model has its own characteristics and uses different approaches to define resources releases from reservoirs and allocation to demand centers. The proposed model comparison and application does not identify in detail all the features of each model, rather it provides insights as to how these generic simulation models implement and evaluate different operating rules.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Applied to a central South Korean watershed where wastewater is reused for paddy irrigation, the present model was verified in terms of structure and behavior. Structural validity was confirmed when expected simulation sensitivity and consistency criteria were met during behavior sensitivity and extreme conditions tests. The model&#x27;s behavioral validity in predicting hydrological processes including evapotranspiration, stream flow, and groundwater level, was also confirmed as the calibrated model performance during the validation period showed good agreement with those of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, validated for the study watershed, as well as observed groundwater levels. The values of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS), percent bias (PBIAS), and R2 which compared model results with those of the SWAT model were 0.77, 3.0%, and 0.79, respectively, for the evapotranspiration, and 0.69, 1.4%, and 0.75, respectively, for the stream flow, while the generated and observed groundwater levels exhibited a linear relationship with an R2 value of 0.70. The validated model indicated that urbanization within the study watershed could lead to increased stream flow and greater wastewater reuse. Instream flow regulation led to a decrease in stream flow tied to a lower base flow, and a decrease in social benefits associated with a decline in wastewater reuse. An assessment was made of the SD-based socio-hydrological model&#x27;s usefulness when acting as an element of an integrated framework in providing a better understanding of small-scale socio-hydrological systems&#x27; interactions and the underlying causes of general trends and problems. SD-based socio-hydrological modeling was deemed a suitable decision-support framework for designing water resource policies contributing to successful integrated water resources management practice.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Hanseok Jeong&quot;,&quot;J.

This paper employs system dynamics modeling to determine hydrologic and economic implications of an irrigation efficiency (IE) policy (increased conveyance efficiency and field efficiency) in a coupled sociohydrologic system with three climate scenarios. Simulations are conducted within the lower Rio Grande region (LRG) of New Mexico for the years 1969 to 2099, including water, land, capital, and population modules. Quadrant analysis is utilized to compare the IE policy outcomes with the base case and to categorize results of simulations according to hydrologic and economic sustainability. The four categories are beneficial, unacceptable, unsustainable agricultural development, and unsustainable hydrology. Simulation results for the IE policy analyzed here fall into the categories of unsustainable agricultural development or unacceptable, suggesting there are long-term negative effects to regional economies in all scenarios with mixed results for hydrologic variables. IE policy can yield water for redistribution as increased unit water supply in the field produces more deep percolation; however, IE policy sacrifices regional connectivity. Specifically, simulation results show that the policy increases abundance by 4.7\u201374.5% and return flow by \u22123.0\u20139.9%. These positive results, however, come at the cost of decreased hydrologic connectivity (\u221231.5 to \u221225.1%) and negative economic impacts (\u221232.7 to \u22125.7%). Long-term net depletions in groundwater are also observed from loss of hydrologic connectivity and increased agricultural water demand from projections of increased consumptive use of crops. Adaptive water management that limits water use in drought years and replenishes groundwater in abundant years as well as economic incentives to offset the costs of infrastructure improvements will be necessary for the IE policy to result in sustainable agriculture and water resources.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Yining Bai&quot;,&quot;Saeed P.

In this aquifer, as a consequence of the particular hydrogeological framework, both direct and lateral recharge mechanisms coexist. Hence, the dynamics of groundwater level variations are quite complex and strongly non-linear. Our focus was essentially on the short-term behavior of groundwater levels, with a specific analysis on episodic rainfall events. To model these dynamics, due to the presence of the preferential pathways in the infiltration processes, a kinematic dispersion wave model was used. Specifically, a one-dimensional and non-linear particle-based numerical model was developed. It uses ideal particles with constant water volume travel, according to celerity and hydraulic dispersion, to simulate the infiltration rate wave through the vadose zone. The infiltration rate that reaches the water table represents the input function to evaluate the aquifer groundwater level fluctuations. As a consequence of the special lithological and storage capacity characteristics of the surficial layers, groundwater flow conditions change from unconfined to confined. The developed model analyzes the direct groundwater supply under natural conditions, including episodic rainfall, and it has been validated using a high-resolution time series of rainfall data and groundwater level obtained from the monitoring station Terra Montonata.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Nicola Pastore&quot;,&quot;C.

Simulation and optimization models can provide a useful support to the planning process. Besides including all significant processes, they need to incorporate the contribution of the relevant stakeholders from the early stages of their development, particularly in areas where multiple concurring uses of water resources occur and where surface water-groundwater interactions are important.&amp;#160; This is the case of the plain of the Lombardy Region, Italy, where an ancient system of irrigation canals has been successfully used for centuries to supply huge amounts of water to a large irrigated area, which is also one of the most industrialized in Europe (Lombardy is one of the &amp;#8220;Four Motors for Europe&amp;#8221;, a transnational network of highly industrialized regions including Rh&amp;#244;ne-Alpes, Baden-W&amp;#252;rttemberg and Catalonia). Indeed, the Lombardy water resources have suffered recurrent crisis in the last years and a huge pressure has been raising on irrigation water use, which is by far the main consumptive use. We illustrate here an integrated approach to the analysis of different strategies of adaptation of irrigation systems to changing conditions, which accounts for the links between water use, crop production, energy consumption and hydrological conditions (as a proxy of the ecosystems quality). &amp;#160;We will consider the case study of the Adda river basin, an 8,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; basin including lake Como, where the requirements of hydropower production and irrigation supply need to strike a balance with lake tourism, flood protection and environment conservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is based on a combination of simulation models (of upstream sub-basin, lake and downstream sub-basin) and optimization model (of lake regulation policy) that allow assessing the effects of different climate and technological scenarios. The former scenarios were obtained downscaling the regional climate projections provided by the CORDEX project till 2100, while for the latter we focused on measures to increase the efficiency of irrigation systems, that emerged as priority from the discussions with the stakeholders. Specifically, we considered different degrees of reconversion of irrigation methods from surface irrigation to more efficient methods (sprinkler or drip). The effects of the reconversion, under different climate projections, were assessed by running simulations with the IdrAgra spatially distributed agro-hydrological model, which provided the estimated values of crop water use, groundwater recharge, return flows, as well as of crop production and energy consumption. &amp;#160;The comparison of different reconversion intensities was carried out considering indicators for the satisfaction of crop water requirements, the energy consumption, the groundwater recharge, and the river hydrological regime. A number of remarks can be made from the analysis of the results, among which it clearly emerged that under the current trend of increasing temperature already at the mid of the century irrigation deficits and impacts on the river hydrological regime will be intolerable unless the irrigation system efficiency will increase significantly in vast portions of the study area. Finally, a preliminary estimate of the cost of interventions is provided.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C. Gandolfi&quot;,&quot;A. Castagna&quot;,&quot;A.

The comparison between measured and simulated responses, both distributed (water table and soil moisture) and integrated (streamflow at the outlet), shows that the model satisfactorily reproduces various nonlinear processes, in particular threshold behavior and hysteresis in the catchment storage\u2010discharge relationship. We typically observe a clockwise loop in this relationship, i.e., streamflow response is faster than groundwater and soil moisture response, due to larger time scales for subsurface processes and to soil moisture persistence and redistribution. The model is based on a standard Richards equation representation of integrated saturated\u2010unsaturated\u2010runoff dynamics and needs no ad hoc parameterization (e.g., for macropores, pipe flow, or retention curve hysteresis) to capture observed hysteretic relationships between storage and discharge. Additional numerical experiments are carried out to investigate how heterogeneity (bedrock permeability and the distinction between riparian and hillslope areas) and aquifer thickness and topography affect this nonlinear dynamics. The results show that catchment topography and soil depth exert the main control on the hysteresis and threshold patterns. This is evident from a spatial analysis of streamflow and water table response times to storm events, where the threshold points correspond to changes in terrain slope. These findings are confirmed by a further set of analyses carried out on an idealized v\u2010shaped catchment.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M. Camporese&quot;,&quot;D. Penna&quot;,&quot;M.

System dynamics techniques were used to develop a general model for estimating changes in net annual groundwater storage. This model framework was applied to two inland groundwater basins in California and tested against groundwater depletion data developed by the United States Geological Survey. Changes in net groundwater storage developed from these models were compared to values from numerical models provided by the United States Geological Survey. The basin-specific models were able to replicate changes in net annual groundwater storage volumes for 1-year and 5-year periods at a level suitable for planning, with R2 values ranging from 0.88 to 0.93. At the 10-year prediction period, R2 values ranged from 0.83 to 0.91. The results of this research illustrate that a system dynamics model using observed relationships between components may be capable of predicting behavior for the purposes of groundwater management planning.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

To diagnose and quantify potential vulnerabilities, effective modeling tools are required to represent the interactions between water availability, water demands and their natural and anthropogenic drivers across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Despite significant progresses, system models often undergo various level of simplifications. For instance, several variables are represented within models as prescribed values; and therefore, their links with their natural and anthropogenic drives are not represented. Here we propose a data-driven emulation approach to represent the local dynamics of water resource systems through advising a set of interconnected functional mappings that not only learn and replicate input-output relationships of an existing model, but also link the prescribed variables to their corresponding natural and anthropogenic drivers. To demonstrate the practical utility of the suggested methodology, we consider representing the local dynamics at the Oldman Reservoir, which is a critical infrastructure for effective regional water resource management in southern Alberta, Canada. Using a rigorous setup/falsification procedure, we develop a set of alternative emulators to describe the local dynamics of irrigation demand and withdrawals along with reservoir release and evaporation. The non-falsified emulators are then used to address the impact of changing climate on the local irrigation deficit. Our analysis shows that local irrigation deficit is more sensitive to changes in local temperature than those of local precipitation. In addition, the rate of change in irrigation deficit is much more significant under a unit degree of warming than a unit degree of cooling. Such local understandings are not attainable by the existing operational model.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Shahin Zandmoghaddam&quot;,&quot;A. Nazemi&quot;,&quot;E.

In this context, numerical models acquire a special relevance to quantify the availability of water resources and predict their behavior under changing climate conditions. This work shows the procedure followed to model a mountainous fractured aquifer located in the northern Apennines (Italy) using an open source code. This aquifer feeds springs with an average discharge of about 96.8 L/s. Even though they are not exploited at the moment, these springs might represent a relevant resource of freshwater for public water supply and are essential for ecosystem sustainment. The main limitation faced to model the aquifer in a realistic way is the lack of data, which hinders the calibration of the model. A nonconventional procedure was followed to obtain information on the hydraulic parameters. The hydraulic conductivity is computed from a steady-state calibration for which a limited number of groundwater head observations are available, whilst information concerning the storage coefficient is obtained analytically from the spring discharge recession curve. Finally, the model is used for predicting the system behavior under different groundwater recharge scenarios. Numerical simulations and analytical approximations reveal that the studied aquifer can provide fresh water under different groundwater recharge conditions and has the capacity to smooth the effects of short drought periods, representing an option for water management strategies in the region.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Petronici&quot;,&quot;Pujades&quot;,&quot;Jurado&quot;,&quot;Marcaccio&quot;,&quot;Borgatti&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2019,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Water&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/modelling-mulino-delle-vene-aquifer-northern-italy-tool-petronici/f10769c8dda65b65988958e65f9e8b85/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.3390/w11122505&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;11&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;2505&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:18},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Hydrological Implications of Recent Droughts (2004\u20132022): A SWAT-Based Study in an Ancient Lowland Irrigation Area in Lombardy, Northern Italy&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;This study examines the hydrological dynamics of the Ticino irrigation cascade in northern Italy from 2004 to 2022. The region, which is shaped by human activity, is characterized by its flat topography and complex management of water resources, featuring a unique historic irrigation cascade. Utilizing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), we investigated the water availability during recent severe droughts in this complex agricultural environment, which lacks natural drainage. This area faces risks due to increasing temperatures and increased rainless days. Therefore, understanding the soil water dynamics is essential for maintaining the system\u2019s sustainability. Calibrating and validating the SWAT model with runoff data was challenging due to the absence of natural drainage. Thus, we utilized MOD16 evapotranspiration (AET) data for calibration. Generally, the calibration and validation of the SWAT model yielded satisfactory results in terms of the Kling\u2013Gupta efficiency (KGE). Despite some discrepancies, which were mainly related to the data sources and resolution, the calibrated model\u2019s outputs showed increased actual evapotranspiration that was influenced by climate and irrigation, leading to water deficits and droughts. The soil water content (SWC) decreased by 7% over 15 years, impacting crop productivity and environmental sustainability. This also resulted in rising water stress for crops and the ecosystem in general, highlighting the direct impact of adverse climate conditions on soil hydrology and agriculture. Our research contributes to the understanding of soil\u2013water dynamics, as it specifically addresses recent droughts in the Lombardy lowlands.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Water shortage is one of the most critical issues threatening human welfare, public health, and ecosystems. This issue has turned into a major challenge in many river basins all around the world due to the imbalance in water supply and demand. Use of simulation models can be effective tools in providing water managers with scientifically supported decisions in dealing with complex and uncertain water resource systems. System dynamics approach serves as a management tool and may play an important role in understanding the cause\u2013effect in water resources systems. In the present study, system dynamics approach was applied to simulate management strategies dealing with Tehran metropolitan water resources systems. In the developed model, the trend of water storage in the next 30-year period and the effectiveness of water supply strategies were simulated. The results showed that, despite the growing shortage of the water resources, optimal use of existing resources under appropriate strategies could reduce water deficit within the next 30\u00a0years.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Explain how you would measure the inputs, outputs, and feedback loops (in-flow, out-flow, connectors or dependencies, stocks, and sources or sinks) in each example. Keep it simple.\n\n### Answer:\nCertainly! Let&#x27;s explore the system dynamics of a stock-limited resource like a clean fresh water source in Italy, and a flow-limited resource such as olive oil. I&#x27;ll illustrate the process of measuring inputs, outputs, and feedback loops for both examples in a straightforward manner.\n\n#### Stock-Limited Resource: Clean Fresh Water Source in Italy\n\nImagine a pristine lake nestled in the Italian countryside, serving as a vital source of clean fresh water. The dynamics of this resource can be understood by examining its components: stocks, flows, and feedback loops.\n\n**Stocks**:\nThe central stock here is the **fresh water** available in the lake. This is the total amount of water that can be accessed for various uses.\n\n**Flows**:\nThe **inflows** into the lake include natural processes such as **precipitation**, **river inflow**, and **groundwater recharge**. These inflows replenish the water stock. Conversely, the **outflows** encompass **water extraction** for agriculture, industry, and domestic use, alongside **evaporation** and **natural seepage**.\n\n**Feedback Loops**:\nTwo main feedback loops influence the lake&#x27;s water levels. The **regeneration feedback loop** involves the natural replenishment of water through rainfall and groundwater recharge. The **depletion feedback loop** captures the water loss through extraction and evaporation. These loops are interconnected with various dependencies and connectors.\n\n**Connectors/Dependencies**:\nSeveral factors influence the system:\n- **Population Growth**: Increasing population heightens water demand.\n- **Climate Conditions**: Variations in weather affect precipitation and evaporation rates.\n- **Agricultural Practices**: The type of crops grown and irrigation methods directly impact water usage.\n- **Regulatory Policies**: Laws and regulations can impose restrictions on water usage, affecting the outflow rates.\n\n**Measurement**:\nTo manage this resource effectively, one must measure:\n- **Inputs**: Precipitation rates, river inflow volumes, and groundwater recharge rates.\n- **Outputs**: Water extraction amounts, evaporation rates, and seepage volumes.\n- **Feedback Loops**: Monitoring changes in water levels over time helps understand the balance between regeneration and depletion. Additionally, assessing the impact of regulatory policies can guide sustainable usage practices.\n\n#### Flow-Limited Resource: Olive Oil\n\nNow, picture the sun-drenched olive groves of Italy, where the production of olive oil follows a distinct set of dynamics. Here, the focus is on the flow of resources rather than their stock.\n\n**Stocks**:\nThe primary stock in this scenario is the **olive stock**, representing the quantity of olives available for oil production.\n\n**Flows**:\nThe **inflow** consists of the **harvest of olives** from the groves. These olives are then processed to produce olive oil. The **outflow** includes the **production of olive oil**, its **export**, and **consumption**.\n\n**Feedback Loops**:\nTwo significant feedback loops govern this system. The **production feedback loop** relates to the rate at which olives are processed into oil. The **consumption feedback loop** deals with how quickly olive oil is consumed, influencing future production demand.\n\n**Connectors/Dependencies**:\nSeveral dependencies shape this dynamic:\n- **Seasonal Growth**: Olive production is inherently seasonal and sensitive to climate conditions.\n- **Market Demand**: Fluctuations in demand impact production rates and market prices.\n- **Agricultural Practices**: Advanced farming techniques and technologies can improve olive yield and quality.\n- **Economic Policies**: Trade policies and subsidies can affect production and export levels.\n\n**Measurement**:\nManaging olive oil production involves measuring:\n- **Inputs**: Quantity of olives harvested.\n- **Outputs**: Volume of olive oil produced, exported, and consumed.\n- **Feedback Loops**: Monitoring the health of olive trees and yield predictions for future harvests. Tracking market trends to adjust production in response to demand and assessing agricultural practices to optimize yield.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, understanding the system dynamics of both stock-limited and flow-limited resources involves careful measurement and monitoring of inputs, outputs, and feedback loops. For the clean fresh water source, the focus is on balancing natural replenishment with extraction and usage. For olive oil, it\u2019s about managing the flow from harvest through production to consumption, while responding to market and environmental influences. This approach ensures sustainable management and long-term availability of these vital resources."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Two resources that illustrate the complexities of resource management are its clean fresh water sources and olive oil production. Each of these resources, one stock-limited and the other flow-limited, requires a nuanced understanding of inputs, outputs, and feedback loops to ensure sustainable use.\n\n#### The Tale of Clean Fresh Water\n\nIn the picturesque regions of Italy, clean fresh water is a precious stock-limited resource. Picture a serene lake nestled in the Italian Alps or an ancient aquifer beneath the rolling hills of Tuscany. These sources of fresh water are finite and must be carefully managed to avoid depletion.\n\nThe dynamics of fresh water begin with its inflows: precipitation, river inflows, and groundwater recharge. These natural processes replenish the water stock, akin to a bank account receiving regular deposits. However, the outflows\u2014water extraction for agriculture, industry, and domestic use, along with evaporation and natural seepage\u2014act like withdrawals. As more water is extracted to irrigate vineyards and olive groves, or to quench the thirst of bustling cities, the stock diminishes.\n\nUnderstanding these inflows and outflows is crucial. Measuring precipitation rates and river inflow provides insight into how much water is being added to the stock, while tracking water extraction volumes and evaporation rates reveals how much is being consumed. The feedback loops are critical here: if water levels drop too low, it signals that the outflows are outpacing the inflows, triggering a need for regulatory policies or conservation measures to restore balance.\n\nFeedback from the ecosystem also plays a vital role. A decrease in water levels might prompt stricter water usage regulations or incentivize the adoption of water-saving technologies. Monitoring these changes over time helps manage the delicate equilibrium of water resources, ensuring that the picturesque lakes and aquifers continue to thrive.\n\n#### The Story of Olive Oil\n\nOn the other side of the resource spectrum lies olive oil, a flow-limited resource deeply embedded in Italy\u2019s cultural and economic fabric. Unlike water, olive oil production depends on the continuous flow of olives harvested from the countless groves scattered across the countryside.\n\nThe journey of olive oil starts with the seasonal harvest of olives, the lifeblood of this flow-limited resource. The inflows here are the olives collected from trees each year, influenced by factors like climatic conditions and agricultural practices. The outflows are the bottles of golden olive oil that grace dining tables around the world, along with olives exported as whole fruit and the local consumption of olive oil.\n\nTo manage this flow, it\u2019s essential to measure the quantity of olives harvested each season. This data provides a snapshot of the potential olive oil production. On the other hand, tracking the volume of olive oil produced, exported, and consumed helps gauge the outflows. The feedback loops in this system are driven by market demand and production capacities. A surge in demand for Italian olive oil, for instance, might encourage farmers to optimize their harvesting techniques or expand their groves.\n\nEconomic and agricultural policies also intertwine with these feedback loops. Subsidies for olive farmers, advancements in farming technology, and trade policies can all influence the flow of olives into oil. By monitoring market prices and consumer trends, producers can adjust their output to meet demand, ensuring that the flow remains steady and sustainable.\n\n#### The Interwoven Dynamics\n\nBoth clean fresh water and olive oil exemplify the intricate dance of resource management. For water, maintaining a balance between natural replenishment and human consumption is paramount. For olive oil, synchronizing the seasonal flow of olives with market demands ensures a continuous supply.\n\nIn each case, the careful measurement of inputs and outputs, coupled with an understanding of feedback loops, enables sustainable management. By adapting to changes in climate, market demands, and policy environments, Italy can continue to cherish and sustain its precious resources, ensuring that future generations can enjoy its pristine waters and exquisite olive oil."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s a simplified and concise narrative that explains the systems dynamics of Italian bottled mineral water and olive oil production:\n\n### Italian Bottled Mineral Water: Managing a Finite Resource\n\nItalian bottled mineral water comes from natural underground sources, known as aquifers. These aquifers hold a limited amount of water that gets replenished slowly through natural processes like rainfall seeping into the ground. To keep track of how much water we have, experts regularly check the water levels using special underground measurements. Each bottle of water we drink comes from these aquifers, and the amount taken out is recorded to ensure we don&#x27;t use it up too quickly. The government plays a crucial role by setting rules on how much water can be extracted, based on these measurements. If the water level gets too low, they can decide to reduce the amount of water that companies are allowed to bottle. This helps make sure there&#x27;s enough water for the future, balancing our needs today with the health of the environment.\n\n### Olive Oil Production: A Cycle of Growth and Harvest\n\nOlive oil is made from the oil of harvested olives, and this process depends a lot on the yearly cycle of olive trees. The amount of oil we get can vary each year because it&#x27;s affected by the weather and how the trees are taken care of. Farmers keep track of how many olives they pick and how much oil they produce. When olive oil is sold in stores and used in homes, this information helps businesses understand how much oil is being consumed. If a lot of people want to buy olive oil, farmers might plant more trees or use better technology to increase their harvest. This response to market demand helps ensure that there is always enough olive oil, while also encouraging farmers to use sustainable practices that keep their lands healthy.\n\n### A Balanced Approach to Resource Management\n\nBoth Italian bottled water and olive oil show how important it is to manage natural resources wisely. By monitoring how much we use and how much is left, and by adjusting our usage based on these facts, we can make sure that these resources are available for generations to come. This careful balance helps maintain the health of our environment while also meeting our needs and supporting local economies."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Take, for instance, the case of Italian bottled mineral water, a classic example of a stock-limited resource. The stock in this context is the total volume of water stored within natural aquifers. To measure this stock, hydrological surveys and water level sensors are employed to monitor aquifer levels continuously. Inputs to this system include natural processes such as infiltration and underground flows, replenished by rainfall and other meteorological factors, which are tracked using climate data. Outputs from this system are quantified by the volume of water extracted for bottling, as recorded in production data from bottling facilities. Feedback mechanisms are critical here: regulatory policies adjust water extraction rates based on monitored aquifer levels to prevent depletion, ensuring a sustainable balance between usage and natural replenishment.\n\nSimilarly, olive oil production exemplifies a flow-limited resource system, reliant on the cyclical growth and harvest of olive trees. In this scenario, the stock is the accumulated olive oil ready for distribution, with inventory levels measured in storage facilities offering a direct quantitative insight. The primary input is the annual harvest of olives, which is influenced by environmental conditions such as soil quality and weather, as well as agricultural practices, all of which are assessed through agricultural yield data. The output, meanwhile, is represented by the olive oil sold and consumed, tracked via market sales data. Feedback loops here involve responses to market demand: if demand increases, farmers may expand cultivation areas or invest in more efficient technologies, both of which are monitored through economic studies and technology adoption rates.\n\nThese two examples highlight the necessity of a structured approach to managing both stock-limited and flow-limited resources. By measuring and analyzing inputs, stocks, and outputs, and by incorporating responsive feedback loops, policymakers and industry leaders can maintain the delicate balance required for sustainable resource management.

Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J.

New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "title": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "tether_id":

Become Part of Secondary School Math Instruction\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QBrmAGcMIi8\n\n00:00:00.719 hello my name is diana fisher\n00:00:03.040 i have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james kapit proposed\n00:01:54.520 democratizing the comp concepts of\n00:01:57.280 calculus\n00:01:58.399 by providing technology-based learning\n00:02:01.280 environments\n00:02:02.479 he said new notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics learning\n00:02:14.319 sd is such a new and powerful\n00:02:18.080 notation system the audience recognizes\n00:02:21.120 these system dynamics modeling icons\n00:02:23.440 from which sd models can be constructed\n00:02:26.400 the stock\n00:02:27.280 and accumulator represents a main\n00:02:29.599 function in the model\n00:02:31.200 mathematically it operates as an\n00:02:33.519 integral does in calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants parameters or\n00:02:46.080 simple\n00:02:46.560 or arithmetic combinations of model\n00:02:49.040 components\n00:02:50.319 the connector indicates the influence of\n00:02:52.959 one\n00:02:53.360 model component on another\n00:02:55.400 mathematically\n00:02:56.800 the connectors identify the dependencies\n00:02:59.599 of one variable\n00:03:00.879 variable on another i will not take you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra students and the\n00:17:58.000 delays\n00:17:58.880 represented on the right both material\n00:18:01.360 at the top\n00:18:02.080 and information delays at the bottom\n00:18:05.039 could be understood by algebra students\n00:18:08.799 this slide identifies two websites\n00:18:12.080 with resources that you may find useful\n00:18:15.520 the first is a website that contains\n00:18:17.679 some free\n00:18:18.960 sd lessons for use with secondary school\n00:18:21.600 students\n00:18:22.480 as well as where to purchase some books\n00:18:25.039 of sd lessons that are published\n00:18:27.760 it also contains examples of secondary\n00:18:30.080 school students\n00:18:31.039 original sd model diagrams and technical\n00:18:33.919 papers\n00:18:34.480 explaining the models it advertises\n00:18:37.600 online sd courses geared to secondary\n00:18:40.640 school math and science\n00:18:42.000 teachers and shows the alignment of sd\n00:18:45.120 with u.s national educational standards\n00:18:47.600 in many disciplines\n00:18:49.440 the other website contains additional\n00:18:52.640 lessons that can be downloaded or\n00:18:54.640 purchased\n00:18:55.440 and numerous lesson books appropriate\n00:18:58.320 for\n00:18:58.640 pre-college students the experience that\n00:19:02.240 greatly enhanced my opinion about the\n00:19:04.799 virtues of using the system dynamics\n00:19:07.039 modeling approach with students\n00:19:08.960 occurred when i saw what students could\n00:19:11.120 produce\n00:19:12.000 when given the freedom to choose a\n00:19:14.160 dynamic problem that\n00:19:15.520 interested them for which they could\n00:19:17.600 create an original model\n00:19:19.520 write a technical paper explaining their\n00:19:21.760 model and present their model\n00:19:24.400 to an audience\n00:19:27.600 i wanted to prepare students to identify\n00:19:31.280 and analyze\n00:19:32.240 problems in the world from which\n00:19:35.600 they could gain an understanding by\n00:19:37.760 building system dynamics models\n00:19:40.320 i wanted them to develop skill in model\n00:19:43.039 building\n00:19:43.760 in analyzing model design in output and\n00:19:47.120 feedback\n00:19:47.760 and in explaining what they learned so i\n00:19:50.480 designed a secondary school\n00:19:52.640 system dynamics modeling course that i\n00:19:54.799 taught for 20 years\n00:19:56.640 one of the most important lessons i\n00:19:58.640 included in my sd modeling course was to\n00:20:01.120 show students how to translate\n00:20:03.440 a systems problem found in a news\n00:20:05.919 article\n00:20:06.559 into a stock flow diagram students\n00:20:09.360 listed the most important variables\n00:20:11.520 they built the structure of their model\n00:20:13.280 by hand and they also sketched out the\n00:20:15.440 feedback\n00:20:16.159 students indicated that this was one of\n00:20:18.080 the most important lessons in preparing\n00:20:20.640 them to do their final project\n00:20:22.880 i&#x27;m going to magnify this bottom part\n00:20:26.000 so you can see it a little bit better\n00:20:29.760 i know it&#x27;s blurry but it&#x27;s because i\n00:20:32.480 just used the previous picture to\n00:20:34.159 magnify it\n00:20:35.280 but you can see the design of their\n00:20:37.280 model structure you can see their\n00:20:38.960 feedback loop\n00:20:40.159 they&#x27;re doing behavior over time graphs\n00:20:42.320 all of this was part of the lesson\n00:20:44.320 for analyzing an article in the news i&#x27;m\n00:20:47.200 now going to show you\n00:20:48.559 some sample student original sd models\n00:20:52.000 in 2007 when the united states was\n00:20:54.720 experiencing an oil crisis\n00:20:57.200 this student observed that many people\n00:20:59.120 were trying unsuccessfully to buy hybrid\n00:21:02.080 cars this was his idea of why\n00:21:05.760 the problem happened it actually is\n00:21:08.000 broken into three segments\n00:21:10.559 there is the hybrid car segment at the\n00:21:13.440 top\n00:21:14.400 i&#x27;ll go back hybrid car production\n00:21:18.880 hybrid inventory and active\n00:21:21.919 hybrid in vehicles\n00:21:25.360 there is a factory capacity which was a\n00:21:28.799 limiting factor on being able to produce\n00:21:31.200 enough cars\n00:21:32.400 and then there was a backlog of orders\n00:21:35.039 and perceived backlogged\n00:21:37.039 that prospective buyers weren&#x27;t going to\n00:21:39.919 get\n00:21:40.559 a car very soon even if they ordered one\n00:21:44.000 his model did not start an equilibrium\n00:21:46.400 unfortunately\n00:21:47.679 so let&#x27;s ignore the first part of the\n00:21:49.440 graph and and focus on the spike in oil\n00:21:52.640 prices\n00:21:53.520 at week 30. the new demand which is the\n00:21:56.720 pink\n00:21:57.440 curve spikes upward for hybrid cars\n00:22:01.760 that is quickly followed by a spike in\n00:22:04.159 the backlog demand for hybrid cars which\n00:22:06.640 is the brown graph\n00:22:08.400 the price of hybrid cars which is the\n00:22:10.880 green curve shows an\n00:22:12.480 increase as backlog increases the blue\n00:22:15.520 line\n00:22:16.080 which is on a scale by itself is the\n00:22:18.480 number of active hybrid cars\n00:22:20.720 and that is steadily increasing\n00:22:24.000 the first year i introduced material and\n00:22:26.400 information delays to my students\n00:22:28.559 many students understood the ideas\n00:22:30.559 immediately\n00:22:32.080 this student started his model on\n00:22:34.320 workforce pressure\n00:22:35.840 using the idea of three delays so\n00:22:38.960 here we have employees\n00:22:42.080 who are being hired and fired this is\n00:22:45.120 the amount of\n00:22:46.159 work that the company wants done\n00:22:50.080 this is the perceived satisfaction of\n00:22:53.200 the current working people\n00:22:55.120 and up here is the pay that is given\n00:22:58.960 to the workers the three\n00:23:02.320 delays here are an information delay\n00:23:06.000 down in the perceived satisfaction\n00:23:09.280 and information delay in hiring and\nThe

A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "title": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "tether_id":

Become Part of Secondary School Math Instruction\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QBrmAGcMIi8\n\n00:00:00.719 hello my name is diana fisher\n00:00:03.040 i have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james

notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics

calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants

you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra students and the\n00:17:58.000 delays\n00:17:58.880 represented on the right both material\n00:18:01.360 at the top\n00:18:02.080 and information delays at the bottom\n00:18:05.039 could be understood by algebra students\n00:18:08.799 this slide identifies two websites\n00:18:12.080 with resources that you may find useful\n00:18:15.520 the first is a website that contains\n00:18:17.679 some free\n00:18:18.960 sd lessons for use with secondary school\n00:18:21.600 students\n00:18:22.480 as well as where to purchase some books\n00:18:25.039 of sd lessons that are published\n00:18:27.760 it also contains examples of secondary\n00:18:30.080 school students\n00:18:31.039 original sd model diagrams and technical\n00:18:33.919 papers\n00:18:34.480 explaining the models it advertises\n00:18:37.600 online sd courses geared to secondary\n00:18:40.640 school math and science\n00:18:42.000 teachers and shows the alignment of sd\n00:18:45.120 with u.s national educational standards\n00:18:47.600 in many disciplines\n00:18:49.440 the other website contains additional\n00:18:52.640 lessons that can be downloaded or\n00:18:54.640 purchased\n00:18:55.440 and numerous lesson books appropriate\n00:18:58.320 for\n00:18:58.640 pre-college students the experience that\n00:19:02.240 greatly enhanced my opinion about the\n00:19:04.799 virtues of using the system dynamics\n00:19:07.039 modeling approach with students\n00:19:08.960 occurred when i saw what students could\n00:19:11.120 produce\n00:19:12.000 when given the freedom to choose a\n00:19:14.160 dynamic problem that\n00:19:15.520 interested them for which they could\n00:19:17.600 create an original model\n00:19:19.520 write a technical paper explaining their\n00:19:21.760 model and present their model\n00:19:24.400 to an audience\n00:19:27.600 i wanted to prepare students to identify\n00:19:31.280 and analyze\n00:19:32.240 problems in the world from which\n00:19:35.600 they could gain an understanding by\n00:19:37.760 building system dynamics models\n00:19:40.320 i wanted them to develop skill in model\n00:19:43.039 building\n00:19:43.760 in analyzing model design in output and\n00:19:47.120 feedback\n00:19:47.760 and in explaining what they learned so i\n00:19:50.480 designed a secondary school\n00:19:52.640 system dynamics modeling course that i\n00:19:54.799 taught for 20 years\n00:19:56.640 one of the most important lessons i\n00:19:58.640 included in my sd modeling course was to\n00:20:01.120 show students how to translate\n00:20:03.440 a systems problem found in a news\n00:20:05.919 article\n00:20:06.559 into a stock flow diagram students\n00:20:09.360 listed the most important variables\n00:20:11.520 they built the structure of their model\n00:20:13.280 by hand and they also sketched out the\n00:20:15.440 feedback\n00:20:16.159 students indicated that this was one of\n00:20:18.080 the most important lessons in preparing\n00:20:20.640 them to do their final project\n00:20:22.880 i&#x27;m going to magnify this bottom part\n00:20:26.000 so you can see it a little bit better\n00:20:29.760 i know it&#x27;s blurry but it&#x27;s because i\n00:20:32.480 just used the previous picture to\n00:20:34.159 magnify it\n00:20:35.280 but you can see the design of their\n00:20:37.280 model structure you can see their\n00:20:38.960 feedback loop\n00:20:40.159 they&#x27;re doing behavior over time graphs\n00:20:42.320 all of this was part of the lesson\n00:20:44.320 for analyzing an article in the news i&#x27;m\n00:20:47.200 now going to show you\n00:20:48.559 some sample student original sd models\n00:20:52.000 in 2007 when the united states was\n00:20:54.720 experiencing an oil crisis\n00:20:57.200 this student observed that many people\n00:20:59.120 were trying unsuccessfully to buy hybrid\n00:21:02.080 cars this was his idea of why\n00:21:05.760 the problem happened it actually is\n00:21:08.000 broken into three segments\n00:21:10.559 there is the hybrid car segment at the\n00:21:13.440 top\n00:21:14.400 i&#x27;ll go back hybrid car production\n00:21:18.880 hybrid inventory and active\n00:21:21.919 hybrid in vehicles\n00:21:25.360 there is a factory capacity which was a\n00:21:28.799 limiting factor on being able to produce\n00:21:31.200 enough cars\n00:21:32.400 and then there was a backlog of

the &quot;Week 4_Systems Thinking for Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment&quot; document, three dimensions of improvement in Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) are highlighted:\n\n1. **Integration of environmental, economic, and social dimensions**: This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the impacts and dependencies of a system on these interrelated aspects. It is crucial because isolating any of these dimensions can lead to a skewed understanding of sustainability, potentially exacerbating other issues.\n\n2. **Systems thinking**: This involves considering the entire life cycle of a product or service, from raw material extraction through to disposal. This holistic perspective is essential to identify critical leverage points for improvement and potential unintended consequences of changes within any stage of the life cycle.\n\n3. **Stakeholder engagement**: Engaging stakeholders across the lifecycle allows for a more accurate representation of interests and values, ensuring that the sustainability assessments are relevant and practical across different societal and economic contexts.\n\n### Importance and Application to Learning from Earlier Modules:\n\nThese dimensions resonate deeply with my own critiques and explorations of capitalist systems. Capitalism, by its very nature, fosters competition and profit maximization, often at the expense of environmental sustainability and social equity. The focus on integrating diverse dimensions within LCSA offers a framework that challenges the single-minded profit motive by advocating for environmental stewardship and social well-being.\n\n**Integration of Multiple Dimensions** aligns with the need for a holistic approach that I value. It ensures that environmental, economic, and social aspects are not optimized in isolation, which can lead to transferring problems from one area to another rather than solving them. For instance, a solution that is economically viable and environmentally sustainable must also be socially equitable to prevent exacerbating social inequalities.\n\n**Systems Thinking** offers a critique of simplistic, linear thinking\u2014a common critique of capitalist approaches, which often ignore complex interdependencies and long-term consequences for short-term gains. By understanding the interconnectedness of systems, we can foresee and mitigate the broader impacts of economic activities, such as the exploitation of labor and resources.\n\n**Stakeholder Engagement** is crucial in challenging the top-down power dynamics often found in capitalist enterprises. It ensures that the voices of marginalized and directly impacted communities are heard and heeded in the development of sustainable practices. This democratization of decision-making processes is essential to counteract the often exploitative nature of unchecked capitalist systems, which prioritize profit over people.\n\nBy applying these principles, we can develop more equitable, sustainable, and holistic approaches to living and working together, which is crucial in a globalized world where the actions of one can impact the many. This approach not only critiques but actively works against the inequities perpetuated by capitalist systems, highlighting the importance of systemic change for true sustainability."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

After an introduction to the problem of overcoming social dilemmas\n\nthrough collective ac t io ,th e  remainder of this article is divided into six sections. The first briefly reviews the\ntheoretical predictions of curently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second\nsection summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by\nextensive erperimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to\nshow how individuals achieve results that are &quot;better than rational&quot; by building conditions where reciprocity,\nreputation  and trust can help to overcome the stong temptations of short-nun self-interest. The fourth\nsection raises the possibiliry of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops\nan  initial theoretical sc ea rio , and the  final section concludes by examining the implications o f  placing\nreciprocity reputation  and  trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.\n\nwe are hand-waving at  our central questions. I am\nafraid that  we do a lot of hand-waving.\n\net me start with a provocative statement. You\nwould not be reading this article if it were not for\nsome of our ancestors learning how to undertake\n\ncollective action to solve social dilem mas. Successive\ngenerations have added to the stock of everyday knowl-\nedge about how to instill productive norms of behavior\nin their children and to craft rules to support collective\naction that produces public goods and avoids &quot;trage-\ndies of the commons.&quot;I What our ancestors and con-\ntemporaries have learned about engaging in collective\naction for mutual defense,child rearing,and survival is\nnot , however, understood or explained by the extant\ntheory of collective action.\n\nThe lessons of effective collective action are not\nsimple\u2014as is obvious from human history and the\nimmense tragedies that humans have endured ,as  well\nas the successes we have realized. As global relation-\nships become even more intricately intertwined and\ncomplex,however, our survival becomes more depen-\ndent on empirically grounded scientific understanding.\nWe have not yet developed a behavioral theory of\ncollective action based on models of the individual\nconsistent with empirical evidence about how individ-\nuals make decisions in social-dilemma situations. A\nbehavioralcommitment to theory grounded in empir-\nical inquiry is essential if we are to understand such\nbasic questions as why face-to-face communication so\nconsistently enhances cooperation in social dilemmas\nor how structural variables facilitate or impede cffec-\ntive collective action.\n\nSocial dilemmas occur whenever individuals in inter-\ndependent situations face choices in which the maxi-\nmization of short-term self-interest yields outcomes\nleaving all participants worse off than feasible alterna-\ntives. In a public-good dilemma, for example, all those\nwho would benefit from the provision of a public\ngood\u2014such as pollution control, radio broadcasts  or\nweather forecasting\u2014find it costly to contribute and\nwould prefer others to pay for the good instead. If\neveryone follows the equilibrium strategy, then the\ngood is not provided or  is underprovided  Yet, every-\none would be better off if everyone were to contribute.\n\nSocial dilemmas are found in all aspects of life,\nleading to momentous decisions affecting war and\npeace as well as the mundane relationships of keeping\npromises in everyday life.Social dilemmas are called by\nmany names, including the public-good or collective-\ngood problem(Olson 1965, P.  Samuelson 1954),shirk-\ning(Alchian and Demsetz 1972), the free-rider prob-\nlem(Edney 1979,Grossman and Hart 1980),moral\nhazard(Holmstrom 1982),the credible commitment\ndilemma(Williams, Collins, and Lichbach 1997), gen-\neralized social exchange (Ekch 1974; Emerson 1972a,\n\nYet, the theory of collective action is the central\nsubject of political science  It is the core of the justifi-\ncation for the state. Collective-action problems per-\nvade international relations, face legislators when de-\nvising public budgets,  permeate public bureaucracies,\nand are at the core of explanations of voting, interest\ngroup formation,and citizen control of governments in\na democracy.

Create a set of up to 10 metrics \u2013 including economic,\nenvironmental, and social indicators \u2013 that you believe should be incorporated into the\nnational sustainability planning for that country. Research the country\u2019s performance\nagainst these metrics and create a \u2018country profile\u2019 briefly explaining why you chose these\nindicators, how your country performed, and innovative ideas you might have for\nincreasing their sustainability across social, economic, and environmental measures.\n\nOkay, I will say it over and over again. I will say it until it ends or there is no more breath in my\nbody: Capitalism is a cancer to humanity, and until we heal the cancer, we are merely trying to\nbail out a sinking ship with a teaspoon and an idealistic plan. To envision a future where\nresources are sustainably maintained, I keep returning to the same thought. As long as profit\nremains the bottom line for countries and all activities are measured solely by their economic\neffects, we sabotage our success before we even begin. We sabotage society by not prioritizing\nour primary objective, which should be societal well-being and happiness. Unfortunately, profit\nis the primary objective in a capitalist society, not societal well-being. Therefore, the ten metrics\nI would propose for Italy&#x27;s sustainability planning:\n\n1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: This is a measure of economic activity within\na country. It\u2019s not a measure of wealth or productivity but is often used as such.\n\n2. Gini Coefficient: This is a measure of inequality in a society. A lower Gini Coefficient\nindicates a more equal distribution of wealth.\n\n3. Environmental Performance Index (EPI): measures a nation\u2019s commitment to\nenvironmental sustainability.\n\n4. Greenhouse Gas Emissions: This is a measure of a country\u2019s impact on climate change.\n5. Renewable Energy Consumption: The nation\u2019s percentage of total energy consumption\n\nthat comes from renewable sources.\n6. Education Index: This is a component of the Human Development Index (HDI) and\n\nmeasures years of schooling for adults and expected years of schooling for children.\n7. Life Expectancy at Birth: This is the average number of years a newborn is expected to\n\nlive, assuming that current mortality rates remain constant throughout their lifetime.\n8. Cultural Diversity Index: This measures a country&#x27;s cultural diversity, including\n\nlanguages, ethnicities, and religions.\n9. Happiness Index: This measures subjective well-being and asks people to rate their\n\noverall satisfaction with life.\n10. Social Support Index: This measures the level of social support an average individual has,\n\nwhich is crucial for mental health and well-being.\n\nHowever, these metrics do not truly indicate where Italy or any country is at because they are\nbased on the platform of capitalism. The financial metrics heavily influences the social and\nenvironmental indicators and all non-financial metrics. Ultimately, a country&#x27;s ability to\nsustainably manage resources depends on its economic resources and regulation of commerce.\n\n\n\nUpon reviewing the data presented by the Happiness Index, Italy ranks 18th globally. However,\nregarding metrics concerning sustainable practices and pollution, Italy finds itself in the red.\nWhile the economic situation in Italy is less favorable than one would hope, wage inequality runs\nrampant. Simultaneously, as in many other nations worldwide, inflation abounds, particularly in\nthe housing market. One may wonder how the 18th most happy country out of over 120 nations\n(Happy Planet Index \u2013 Good Lives Don\u2019t Have to Cost the Earth, n.d.) can experience such\nissues. Would it be premature to assign blame to capitalism?\n\nBefore Italy became the republic it is today, a place I live, know, and love, there were the evil\nfascists who committed atrocities such as giving land to people, constructing entire blocks and\nneighborhoods, and creating a sense of nationalism and unity under one Italian flag. Finally, they\nempowered a man whom my Italian-born and bred fiance described as &quot;inferiority\ncomplex...pavido... apathetic, rapist.&quot; Of course, he referred to the austere and shining figure of\nItalian fascism, il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Back then, they had a different system, perhaps less\ndemocratic, but seemingly more for the people with arguably better, more sustainable industrial,\ncommercial, and lifestyle practices. However, that is a paradox for another discussion post.\n\nToday, in Italy&#x27;s economic climate, there is some uncertainty amongst the populace regarding the\nfeasibility and sustainability of Capitalism, both locally and internationally. The causes and\neffects of these uncertainties affect their overall well-being. Thus, the first measure of my criteria\nis the people&#x27;s ability to earn a living, essentially their economic ability to achieve their most\nimportant ends - clean water, food, housing, and healthcare. These necessities are the most\ncrucial gross domestic products to consider. Hence, Italy&#x27;s GDP and Gini Coefficient, which\nmeasures income inequality within a nation (The World Bank, 2024), should factor into its\nnational sustainability plan. Italy has fared well so far, but like many other places, it could do\nbetter.\n\nItaly\u2019s GDP per capita stands at approximately $34,776.40, reflecting a robust economic\nframework, yet this figure only skims the surface of the nation\u2019s broader socio-economic reality\n(The World Bank, 2024). The Gini Coefficient 34.8 signals significant income disparity, an issue\nthat economic indicators alone cannot resolve (The World Bank, 2024).\n\nItaly\u2019s moderate Environmental Performance Index (EPI) score of 57.70 suggests a commitment\nto environmental sustainability, but there is substantial room for improvement, especially in\nenhancing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions further and bolster renewable energy\ninitiatives (Yale University., 2024). The nation\u2019s push towards renewable energy is\ncommendable, with 32.4% of its electricity demand met by renewables as of 2022 (International\n\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?vdn6GD\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?oD8Zrs\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?eGt89Z\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?FtaIyc\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?9ZcW2L\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Lzsuiq\n\n\nTrade Administration, 2023). Such efforts are crucial in transitioning to a sustainable energy\nfuture. Moreover, Italy\u2019s high life expectancy of 82.8 years (Happy Planet Index \u2013 Good Lives\nDon\u2019t Have to Cost the Earth, n.d.) and a moderate Happiness Index score of 6.26 (Italy |\nEnvironmental Performance Index, n.d.) reflect a society that enjoys a good quality of life. Yet,\nthese figures mask the underlying challenges of social inequality and environmental concerns\n(Rowan, 2023).\n\nGiven these data points, Italy\u2019s sustainability planning should pivot from a purely capitalist focus\nto a more holistic approach that balances economic performance with social equity and\nenvironmental stewardship. The drive towards a sustainable future in Italy could be likened to\nthe intricate art of making the perfect tiramisu\u2014meticulously balancing the bitter with the sweet\nto achieve harmony. Achieving a balance between economic growth, social equity, and\nenvironmental conservation is crucial to securing a better future for Italy. Although a complete\noverhaul of the current capitalist system is unlikely, it is vital that the country strives to create a\nmore cooperative and equitable global community. By prioritizing societal well-being, Italy can\nfoster sustainable practices that promote the health and prosperity of both its citizens and the\nplanet.\n\nPart 2:\n\nShould international governmental organizations, such as the United Nations, the IMF, and\nWorld Bank, adopt new economic metrics that incorporate social well-being and\nenvironmental resource utilization into their economic modeling?\n\nYes, the organizations referenced above should adopt new metrics that measure more than the\neconomic value of an action or activity. The economic value of an action does not always reflect\nits contribution to society&#x27;s overall well-being (Sturgeon, 2019).\n\nTo what degree have they adopted these types of metrics already?\n\nSome organizations and nations have begun to adopt more holistic metrics; however, the degree\nto which these metrics have been implemented varies from aspirational to newly implemented\n(Enhancing IMF-World Bank Collaboration, n.d.; Incorporating Environment, Social and\nGovernance (ESG) Factors Into Fixed Income Investments, n.d.).\n\nWhat is the argument for and/or against this type of shift in performance measurement?\n\nThe argument is straightforward: economic indicators fail to capture the full societal benefits.\nTherefore, we need additional metrics that can measure and indicate the overall benefits,\nincluding those relevant to national and global sustainable planning (Sturgeon, 2019).\n\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Lzsuiq\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?2mPZAx\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?2mPZAx\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?izdfDb\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?izdfDb\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?n90CU5\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ASgIfR\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?5DgFSR\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?5DgFSR\nhttps://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?W4GrWz\n\n\nHow could this spur a more holistic and transparent view of economies, social progress,\nand environmental sustainability?\n\nBy prioritizing what truly matters and allocating our attention accordingly, we can expect to see a\ndecline in misguided policies and economic systems that lack insight and compassion. When we\naccurately gauge what needs to be measured, we can more readily identify aspects that detract\nfrom the well-being of society as a whole.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnhancing IMF-World Bank Collaboration.

we have perfect informationavailable instantaneously.\n00:00:20.042 My phone can tell meeverything about my finances,\n00:00:23.333 where precisely I am on a map\n00:00:25.583 and the best way to my next destination,\n00:00:27.750 all with a click of a button.\n00:00:30.333 But this availabilityof information and transparency\n00:00:33.458 almost completely disappearswhen it comes to consumer products.\n00:00:38.208 If you go to the seafood counterat your local supermarket,\n00:00:41.542 you can probably choosebetween several different types of fish.\n00:00:45.375 But chances are,they won&#x27;t be able to tell you\n00:00:47.958 who caught the fish,where precisely it was caught,\n00:00:51.125 whether it is sustainableto catch it there\n00:00:53.417 and how it got transported.\n00:00:56.083 And that holds truefor almost everything we buy.\n00:00:59.000 Every can of soup,\n00:01:00.792 every piece of meat, every T-shirt.\n00:01:03.333 We as humans, right now,\n00:01:05.625 are destroying the only thingwe really need to survive:\n00:01:09.167 our planet.\n00:01:10.458 And most of the horrible problemsthat we&#x27;re facing today,\n00:01:13.500 like climate change\n00:01:14.792 and modern slavery in supply chains,\n00:01:17.500 come down to decisions.\n00:01:19.250 Human decisions to produce somethingone way and not another.\n00:01:24.958 And that&#x27;s how we, as consumers,\n00:01:27.208 end up making decisionsthat harm the planet\n00:01:30.208 or our fellow humans.\n00:01:31.875 By choosing the wrong products.\n00:01:35.167 But I refuse to believethat anybody here in this room,\n00:01:38.542 or frankly, anybody on this planet,\n00:01:40.625 really wants to buy a product\n00:01:42.542 that harms the planetor our fellow humans\n00:01:46.000 if given the choice.\n00:01:48.583 But you see, choice is a loaded word.\n00:01:50.792 Choice means there&#x27;s another option.\n00:01:53.167 Choice means you can afford that option.\n00:01:56.208 But choice also means\n00:01:57.708 you have enough informationto make an informed decision.\n00:02:01.792 And that information nowadayssimply just doesn&#x27;t exist.\n00:02:06.875 Or at least it&#x27;s really,really hard to access.\n00:02:11.625 But I think this is about to change.\n00:02:13.667 Because we can use technologyto solve this information problem.\n00:02:17.750 And many of the specific technologiesthat we need to do that\n00:02:20.833 have become better and cheaperover the recent years,\n00:02:24.542 and are now ready to be used at scale.\n00:02:27.458 So, over the past two years,\n00:02:28.875 my team and I have been working\n00:02:30.583 with one of the world&#x27;s largestconservation organizations, WWF,\n00:02:34.833 and we&#x27;ve founded a company called OpenSC,\n00:02:38.500 where SC stands for supply chain.\n00:02:41.708 And we believe that by using technology\n00:02:44.125 we can help to create\n00:02:47.500 transparency and traceabilityin supply chains,\n00:02:50.833 and through that,help to completely revolutionize\n00:02:54.375 the way that we buyand also produce products as humans.\n00:03:00.333 Now, some of this is going to sounda little bit like science fiction,\n00:03:04.208 but it&#x27;s already happening.\n00:03:06.083 Let me explain.\n00:03:08.208 So, in order to solvethis information problem,\n00:03:10.833 we need to do three things:\n00:03:12.542 verify, trace and share.\n00:03:15.833 Verify specific sustainability\n00:03:19.333 and ethical production claims\n00:03:21.167 in a data-based and automated way.\n00:03:24.042 Then trace thoseindividual physical products\n00:03:26.917 throughout their supply chains,\n00:03:28.625 and finally, sharethat information with consumers\n00:03:31.667 in a way that truly gives them a choice\n00:03:34.125 and lets them make consumption decisions\n00:03:36.125 that are more aligned with their values.\n00:03:38.958 I&#x27;m going to use a real product\n00:03:42.292 and a supply chain where we&#x27;ve madeall of this a reality already:\n00:03:46.750 a Patagonian toothfish,\n00:03:48.042 or Chilean sea bass,as it&#x27;s called in the US.\n00:03:51.083 Number one, verify.\n00:03:53.792 Verify how something is produced.\n00:03:56.375 But not just by saying,&quot;Trust me, this is good,\n00:03:59.208 trust me, we&#x27;ve doneall the right things,&quot;\n00:04:01.417 but by producing evidencefor that individual physical product,\n00:04:05.458 and the way it was produced.\n00:04:07.750 By producing evidence\n00:04:09.042 for a specific sustainabilityor ethical production claim.\n00:04:12.833 So for example, in the case of the fish,\n00:04:15.708 has this fish been caught in an areawhere there&#x27;s enough of them,\n00:04:19.625 so that it&#x27;s sustainableto catch it there\n00:04:21.666 and not in a marine protected area?\n00:04:24.375 So what we&#x27;re doing here\n00:04:25.750 is we&#x27;re taking almost real-timeGPS data from the ship --\n00:04:29.667 the ship that&#x27;s fishing --\n00:04:31.208 and that tells us where the ship is\n00:04:33.458 and where it&#x27;s going at what speed.\n00:04:36.042 And we can then combine thatwith other types of data,\n00:04:39.208 like, for example,how deep the sea floor is.\n00:04:42.000 And combining all of this information,\n00:04:44.667 our machine-learning algorithmscan then verify, in an automated way,\n00:04:48.833 whether the ship is only fishingwhere it&#x27;s supposed to, or not.\n00:04:53.875 And as sensors become cheaper,\n00:04:56.458 we can put them in more places.\n00:04:58.500 And that means we can capture more data,\n00:05:00.875 and combining thatwith advancements in data science,\n00:05:03.708 it means that we can now verify\n00:05:07.000 specific sustainabilityand ethical production claims\n00:05:11.042 in an automated, real-timeand ongoing manner.\n00:05:15.250 And that really lays the basisfor this information revolution.\n00:05:19.417 So, number two, trace.\n00:05:21.625 Trace those individual physical products,\n00:05:24.708 so that we can truly say\n00:05:26.750 that the claim that we&#x27;ve verifiedabout a certain product\n00:05:29.500 actually belongsto that individual product\n00:05:32.500 that we as consumershave right in front of us.\n00:05:35.042 Because withoutthat level of traceability,\n00:05:38.375 all that we&#x27;ve reallyverified in the first place\n00:05:41.250 is that somebody, somewhere, at some point\n00:05:44.125 caught a fish in a sustainable way,\n00:05:46.458 or didn&#x27;t harm the employeewhen asking them to produce a T-shirt,\n00:05:51.375 or didn&#x27;t use pesticides when growinga vegetable that didn&#x27;t actually need it.\n00:05:57.292 Only if I give a productan identity from the start\n00:06:01.250 and then trace itthroughout the whole supply chain,\n00:06:04.042 can this claim and the valuethat&#x27;s been created\n00:06:07.667 by producing it in the right way\n00:06:10.000 truly stay with it.\n00:06:13.542 Now, I&#x27;ve talked about cheaper sensors.\n00:06:16.167 There are many othertechnological developments\n00:06:18.667 that make all of this much more possibletoday than every before.\n00:06:22.917 For example, the falling costs of tags.\n00:06:26.792 You give a product a name,\n00:06:29.875 a serial number, an identity,\n00:06:31.917 the tag is its passport.\n00:06:34.125 What you can see hereis a toothfish being caught.\n00:06:37.458 This is what&#x27;s called a longline fishery,\n00:06:39.792 so the fish are coming uponto the boat on individual hooks.\n00:06:44.042 And as soon as the fish is on board,\n00:06:46.333 it is killed, and then after that,\n00:06:48.625 we insert a small taginto the fish&#x27;s flesh.\n00:06:52.083 And in that tag, there is an RFID chipwith a unique serial number,\n00:06:56.625 and that tag follows the fishthroughout the whole supply chain\n00:06:59.667 and makes it really easyto sense its presence\n00:07:01.875 at any port, on any truckor in any processing plant.\n00:07:05.417 But consumers can&#x27;t really read RFID tags.\n00:07:08.708 And so, when it comes to filletingand packaging the fish,\n00:07:12.958 we read the RFID tag and then remove it.\n00:07:15.875 And then we add a unique QR codeto the packaging of the fish.\n00:07:20.125 And that QR code then points backto the same information\n00:07:24.625 that we&#x27;ve verified about the fishin the first place.\n00:07:29.083 And so, depending on the typeof product that we&#x27;re working with,\n00:07:32.958 we may use QR codes, bar codes, RFID tags\n00:07:36.750 or other tag technologies.\n00:07:38.542 But there are also technologies\n00:07:40.667 that are at the brinkof large-scale breakthrough\n00:07:43.083 that make tags themselves obsolete.\n00:07:45.083 Like, for example,\n00:07:46.708 analyzing a product for trace elements\n00:07:49.458 that can then tell you quite accuratelywhere it is actually from.\n00:07:53.000 Then there&#x27;s blockchain.\n00:07:54.417 A decentralized technologycan act as a catalyst for this revolution.\n00:07:59.250 Because it can help mitigatesome of the trust issues\n00:08:03.042 that are inherentto giving people information\n00:08:06.542 and then asking themto change their consumption behavior\n00:08:09.750 because of that information.\n00:08:12.125 And so, we use blockchain technology\n00:08:14.833 where it adds value to what we&#x27;re doing.\n00:08:18.083 But importantly,\n00:08:19.375 we don&#x27;t let the limitationsthat this technology still has today,\n00:08:22.542 like, for example,with regards to scaling,\n00:08:24.625 we don&#x27;t let that stand in our way.\n00:08:26.625 And that brings us to the third point.\n00:08:29.125 Share.\n00:08:30.417 How to share the informationthat we&#x27;ve verified and tracked\n00:08:34.292 about where a product is from,how it was produced\n00:08:37.125 and how it got to where it is?\n00:08:39.625 How to share this information\n00:08:41.582 is really differentfrom product to product.\n00:08:44.458 And different from where you buy it.\n00:08:46.792 You behave differentlyin those situations.\n00:08:49.375 You are stressed and time-poorin the supermarket.\n00:08:53.042 Or with short attention span over dinner,\n00:08:55.333 because your date is so cute.\n00:08:57.542 Or you are critical and inquisitive\n00:09:00.583 when researchingfor a larger purchase online.\n00:09:04.750 And so for our fish,\n00:09:06.375 we&#x27;ve developed a digital experience\n00:09:09.333 that works when buying the fishin a freezer in a fish specialty store\n00:09:15.125 and that gives you all of the informationabout the fish and its journey.\n00:09:18.958 But we also worked with a restaurant\n00:09:21.625 and developed a differentdigital experience\n00:09:24.625 that only summarizes the key factsabout the fish and its journey,\n00:09:28.208 and works better in a dinner setting\n00:09:30.667 and, hopefully, theredoesn&#x27;t annoy your date too much.\n00:09:34.250 Now, that brings us full circle.\n00:09:36.625 We&#x27;ve verified that the fish was caught\n00:09:39.667 in an area whereit&#x27;s sustainable to do so.\n00:09:42.667 We&#x27;ve then traced it throughoutthe entire supply chain\n00:09:45.292 to maintain its identity and allthe information that&#x27;s attached to it.\n00:09:49.417 And then, we&#x27;ve sharedthat information with consumers\n00:09:52.000 in a way that gives them a choice\n00:09:53.833 and lets them make consumption decisions\n00:09:56.000 that are more in line with their values.\n00:09:59.542 Now, for this fish example,this is already rolled out at scale.\n00:10:03.667 This season,\n00:10:04.958 the entire fleet of the world&#x27;s largesttoothfish fishing company,\n00:10:08.542 Austral Fisheries,\n00:10:09.917 is tagging every single fishthat they catch\n00:10:12.792 and that ends up in their premiumbranded &quot;Glacier 51&quot; product.\n00:10:17.208 And you can already buy this fish.\n00:10:19.375 And with it, you can have allof the information I talked about today,\n00:10:23.292 and much more,\n00:10:24.792 attached to each individual fishor portion of the fish that you may buy.\n00:10:30.583 But this is not a fish or seafood thing.\n00:10:34.667 We&#x27;re working on many, manydifferent commodities and products\n00:10:37.875 and their supply chains across the globe.\n00:10:40.292 From dairy to fruit and vegetables,\n00:10:42.917 to nonfood products made out of wood.\n00:10:45.708 As a consumer, all of thismay sound like a huge burden,\n00:10:50.250 because you don&#x27;t have timeto look at all of this information\n00:10:53.792 every time you buy something.\n00:10:56.292 And I don&#x27;t expect you to,\n00:10:58.042 because you&#x27;ll have help with that.\n00:11:01.167 In the future, we&#x27;ll leave the decisionof which specific product to buy\n00:11:06.542 increasingly up to machines.\n00:11:08.750 An algorithm will know enough about you\n00:11:11.000 to make those decisions for you,so you don&#x27;t have to.\n00:11:15.500 And maybe it will even doa better job at it.\n00:11:18.375 In a recent study, 85 percent of those\n00:11:20.833 buying a productthrough a virtual assistant\n00:11:23.875 said that they, on occasion,\n00:11:25.708 actually went with the topproduct recommendation\n00:11:28.083 of that virtual assistant,\n00:11:29.375 rather than the specific product or brand\n00:11:31.458 that they set outto buy in the first place.\n00:11:34.208 You just say you need toilet paper,\n00:11:36.042 it&#x27;s then an algorithm that decideswhich brand, price point\n00:11:40.500 or whether you go with recycled or not.\n00:11:43.583 Well, nowadays this is usually basedon what you bought in the past,\n00:11:47.833 or whoever pays the most to the companybehind the virtual assistant.\n00:11:52.042 But why shouldn&#x27;t that be alsobased on your values?\n00:11:57.625 Knowing that you wantto buy planet-friendly\n00:12:00.208 and knowing whether

E I N F O\n\nKeywords:\nClimate policy\nTragedy of the commons\nGlobal commons problem\nTechnological transitions\n\nA B S T R A C T\n\nThe tragedy of the commons provides a powerful narrative for a class of environmental problems, and serves to\nframe them in a way that allows people to identify effective solution strategies. But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

It is crucial because isolating any of these dimensions can lead to a skewed understanding of sustainability, potentially exacerbating other issues.\n\n2. **Systems thinking**: This involves considering the entire life cycle of a product or service, from raw material extraction through to disposal. This holistic perspective is essential to identify critical leverage points for improvement and potential unintended consequences of changes within any stage of the life cycle.\n\n3. **Stakeholder engagement**: Engaging stakeholders across the lifecycle allows for a more accurate representation of interests and values, ensuring that the sustainability assessments are relevant and practical across different societal and economic contexts.\n\n### Importance and Application to Learning from Earlier Modules:\n\nThese dimensions resonate deeply with my own critiques and explorations of capitalist systems. Capitalism, by its very nature, fosters competition and profit maximization, often at the expense of environmental sustainability and social equity. The focus on integrating diverse dimensions within LCSA offers a framework that challenges the single-minded profit motive by advocating for environmental stewardship and social well-being.\n\n**Integration of Multiple Dimensions** aligns with the need for a holistic approach that I value. It ensures that environmental, economic, and social aspects are not optimized in isolation, which can lead to transferring problems from one area to another rather than solving them. For instance, a solution that is economically viable and environmentally sustainable must also be socially equitable to prevent exacerbating social inequalities.\n\n**Systems Thinking** offers a critique of simplistic, linear thinking\u2014a common critique of capitalist approaches, which often ignore complex interdependencies and long-term consequences for short-term gains. By understanding the interconnectedness of systems, we can foresee and mitigate the broader impacts of economic activities, such as the exploitation of labor and resources.\n\n**Stakeholder Engagement** is crucial in challenging the top-down power dynamics often found in capitalist enterprises. It ensures that the voices of marginalized and directly impacted communities are heard and heeded in the development of sustainable practices. This democratization of decision-making processes is essential to counteract the often exploitative nature of unchecked capitalist systems, which prioritize profit over people.\n\nBy applying these principles, we can develop more equitable, sustainable, and holistic approaches to living and working together, which is crucial in a globalized world where the actions of one can impact the many. This approach not only critiques but actively works against the inequities perpetuated by capitalist systems, highlighting the importance of systemic change for true sustainability.\nDrawing from earlier modules, the challenges of sustainable development are deeply rooted in systemic issues exacerbated by capitalist structures that prioritize profit over people and planet.

These dimensions include the integration of environmental, economic, and social dimensions, the application of systems thinking, and the active engagement of stakeholders. Each of these elements is vital for constructing a holistic and effective approach to sustainability that transcends the limitations often imposed by capitalist systems, which typically prioritize profit at the expense of environmental and social equity.\n\n### Integration of Environmental, Economic, and Social Dimensions\n\nThis approach emphasizes the necessity of considering the environmental, economic, and social impacts of products or services throughout their lifecycle. It challenges the capitalist tendency to focus solely on economic gains by highlighting the interconnectedness of these dimensions. Ignoring any of these aspects can lead to solutions that might appear beneficial in one area but are detrimental in others. This critique resonates with the arguments presented in &quot;Beyond the Tragedy of the Commons,&quot; where effective climate governance is discussed as requiring an integrated policy approach rather than reliance on market mechanisms alone, which often fail to address underlying social and environmental issues.\n\n### Systems Thinking\n\nSystems thinking requires understanding the complete lifecycle of a product or service\u2014from raw material extraction to disposal\u2014and identifying potential impacts at each stage. This method helps in pinpointing critical points for intervention and prevents unintended consequences that could arise from changes made in isolation. This concept is supported by the insights from &quot;A Behavioral Approach to the Rational Choice Theory of Collective Action,&quot; which expands the rational choice models to incorporate collective actions that better address complex social dilemmas. It challenges simplistic, linear thinking\u2014common in capitalist approaches\u2014that often overlooks long-term consequences for immediate profit.\n\n### Stakeholder Engagement\n\nEngaging stakeholders across the lifecycle of a product or service ensures that the diverse values and needs of different groups are considered and addressed in the sustainability assessment process. This approach is crucial for democratizing decision-making processes, which often are controlled top-down in capitalist structures. The importance of stakeholder engagement is also highlighted in the module &quot;Why System Dynamics Should Become Part of Secondary School Math Instruction,&quot; which discusses how system dynamics modeling can involve stakeholders in understanding and managing complex systems effectively.\n\nBy applying these three dimensions, as suggested in the LCSA reading, to the broader discussions from earlier modules, it becomes evident how these principles can help counteract the equity and sustainability challenges exacerbated by capitalist systems. These dimensions advocate for a more inclusive, holistic, and long-term approach to sustainability that aligns with social equity and environmental stewardship, rather than focusing narrowly on immediate economic outcomes. This integrated approach not only critiques but actively challenges the inequities perpetuated by capitalist systems, paving the way for more sustainable and equitable global practices."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J.

New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "title": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "tether_id":

Become Part of Secondary School Math Instruction\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QBrmAGcMIi8\n\n00:00:00.719 hello my name is diana fisher\n00:00:03.040 i have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james kapit proposed\n00:01:54.520 democratizing the comp concepts of\n00:01:57.280 calculus\n00:01:58.399 by providing technology-based learning\n00:02:01.280 environments\n00:02:02.479 he said new notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics learning\n00:02:14.319 sd is such a new and powerful\n00:02:18.080 notation system the audience recognizes\n00:02:21.120 these system dynamics modeling icons\n00:02:23.440 from which sd models can be constructed\n00:02:26.400 the stock\n00:02:27.280 and accumulator represents a main\n00:02:29.599 function in the model\n00:02:31.200 mathematically it operates as an\n00:02:33.519 integral does in calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants parameters or\n00:02:46.080 simple\n00:02:46.560 or arithmetic combinations of model\n00:02:49.040 components\n00:02:50.319 the connector indicates the influence of\n00:02:52.959 one\n00:02:53.360 model component on another\n00:02:55.400 mathematically\n00:02:56.800 the connectors identify the dependencies\n00:02:59.599 of one variable\n00:03:00.879 variable on another i will not take you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra students and the\n00:17:58.000 delays\n00:17:58.880 represented on the right both material\n00:18:01.360 at the top\n00:18:02.080 and information delays at the bottom\n00:18:05.039 could be understood by algebra students\n00:18:08.799 this slide identifies two websites\n00:18:12.080 with resources that you may find useful\n00:18:15.520 the first is a website that contains\n00:18:17.679 some free\n00:18:18.960 sd lessons for use with secondary school\n00:18:21.600 students\n00:18:22.480 as well as where to purchase some books\n00:18:25.039 of sd lessons that are published\n00:18:27.760 it also contains examples of secondary\n00:18:30.080 school students\n00:18:31.039 original sd model diagrams and technical\n00:18:33.919 papers\n00:18:34.480 explaining the models it advertises\n00:18:37.600 online sd courses geared to secondary\n00:18:40.640 school math and science\n00:18:42.000 teachers and shows the alignment of sd\n00:18:45.120 with u.s national educational standards\n00:18:47.600 in many disciplines\n00:18:49.440 the other website contains additional\n00:18:52.640 lessons that can be downloaded or\n00:18:54.640 purchased\n00:18:55.440 and numerous lesson books appropriate\n00:18:58.320 for\n00:18:58.640 pre-college students the experience that\n00:19:02.240 greatly enhanced my opinion about the\n00:19:04.799 virtues of using the system dynamics\n00:19:07.039 modeling approach with students\n00:19:08.960 occurred when i saw what students could\n00:19:11.120 produce\n00:19:12.000 when given the freedom to choose a\n00:19:14.160 dynamic problem that\n00:19:15.520 interested them for which they could\n00:19:17.600 create an original model\n00:19:19.520 write a technical paper explaining their\n00:19:21.760 model and present their model\n00:19:24.400 to an audience\n00:19:27.600 i wanted to prepare students to identify\n00:19:31.280 and analyze\n00:19:32.240 problems in the world from which\n00:19:35.600 they could gain an understanding by\n00:19:37.760 building system dynamics models\n00:19:40.320 i wanted them to develop skill in model\n00:19:43.039 building\n00:19:43.760 in analyzing model design in output and\n00:19:47.120 feedback\n00:19:47.760 and in explaining what they learned so i\n00:19:50.480 designed a secondary school\n00:19:52.640 system dynamics modeling course that i\n00:19:54.799 taught for 20 years\n00:19:56.640 one of the most important lessons i\n00:19:58.640 included in my sd modeling course was to\n00:20:01.120 show students how to translate\n00:20:03.440 a systems problem found in a news\n00:20:05.919 article\n00:20:06.559 into a stock flow diagram students\n00:20:09.360 listed the most important variables\n00:20:11.520 they built the structure of their model\n00:20:13.280 by hand and they also sketched out the\n00:20:15.440 feedback\n00:20:16.159 students indicated that this was one of\n00:20:18.080 the most important lessons in preparing\n00:20:20.640 them to do their final project\n00:20:22.880 i&#x27;m going to magnify this bottom part\n00:20:26.000 so you can see it a little bit better\n00:20:29.760 i know it&#x27;s blurry but it&#x27;s because i\n00:20:32.480 just used the previous picture to\n00:20:34.159 magnify it\n00:20:35.280 but you can see the design of their\n00:20:37.280 model structure you can see their\n00:20:38.960 feedback loop\n00:20:40.159 they&#x27;re doing behavior over time graphs\n00:20:42.320 all of this was part of the lesson\n00:20:44.320 for analyzing an article in the news i&#x27;m\n00:20:47.200 now going to show you\n00:20:48.559 some sample student original sd models\n00:20:52.000 in 2007 when the united states was\n00:20:54.720 experiencing an oil crisis\n00:20:57.200 this student observed that many people\n00:20:59.120 were trying unsuccessfully to buy hybrid\n00:21:02.080 cars this was his idea of why\n00:21:05.760 the problem happened it actually is\n00:21:08.000 broken into three segments\n00:21:10.559 there is the hybrid car segment at the\n00:21:13.440 top\n00:21:14.400 i&#x27;ll go back hybrid car production\n00:21:18.880 hybrid inventory and active\n00:21:21.919 hybrid in vehicles\n00:21:25.360 there is a factory capacity which was a\n00:21:28.799 limiting factor on being able to produce\n00:21:31.200 enough cars\n00:21:32.400 and then there was a backlog of orders\n00:21:35.039 and perceived backlogged\n00:21:37.039 that prospective buyers weren&#x27;t going to\n00:21:39.919 get\n00:21:40.559 a car very soon even if they ordered one\n00:21:44.000 his model did not start an equilibrium\n00:21:46.400 unfortunately\n00:21:47.679 so let&#x27;s ignore the first part of the\n00:21:49.440 graph and and focus on the spike in oil\n00:21:52.640 prices\n00:21:53.520 at week 30. the new demand which is the\n00:21:56.720 pink\n00:21:57.440 curve spikes upward for hybrid cars\n00:22:01.760 that is quickly followed by a spike in\n00:22:04.159 the backlog demand for hybrid cars which\n00:22:06.640 is the brown graph\n00:22:08.400 the price of hybrid cars which is the\n00:22:10.880 green curve shows an\n00:22:12.480 increase as backlog increases the blue\n00:22:15.520 line\n00:22:16.080 which is on a scale by itself is the\n00:22:18.480 number of active hybrid cars\n00:22:20.720 and that is steadily increasing\n00:22:24.000 the first year i introduced material and\n00:22:26.400 information delays to my students\n00:22:28.559 many students understood the ideas\n00:22:30.559 immediately\n00:22:32.080 this student started his model on\n00:22:34.320 workforce pressure\n00:22:35.840 using the idea of three delays so\n00:22:38.960 here we have employees\n00:22:42.080 who are being hired and fired this is\n00:22:45.120 the amount of\n00:22:46.159 work that the company wants done\n00:22:50.080 this is the perceived satisfaction of\n00:22:53.200 the current working people\n00:22:55.120 and up here is the pay that is given\n00:22:58.960 to the workers the three\n00:23:02.320 delays here are an information delay\n00:23:06.000 down in the perceived satisfaction\n00:23:09.280 and information delay in hiring and\nThe

We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 40, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source"}, "url": "file-EeszXNwz7GyPR5y3isYsJyro"}}], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "85324676-b68a-4bac-baaf-4161a539f079", "request_id": "888778638f7d0e5e-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "content_references": [{"matched_text": "\u301040\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1373, "end_idx": 1384, "alt": null, "type": "file", "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "id": "file-EeszXNwz7GyPR5y3isYsJyro", "source": "my_files", "snippet": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8.

We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "cloud_doc_url": null}]}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "85324676-b68a-4bac-baaf-4161a539f079", "children": ["aaa2e9cb-0a49-40f3-a80f-05717987b46f"]}, "aaa2e9cb-0a49-40f3-a80f-05717987b46f": {"id": "aaa2e9cb-0a49-40f3-a80f-05717987b46f", "message": {"id": "aaa2e9cb-0a49-40f3-a80f-05717987b46f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716492783.872601, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Okay, can you rewrite that answer in narrative pagraph, short essay format"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "888779b85d9f0e5e-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "1d7e9aae-5a99-441e-a0c4-3df20a69fa38", "children": ["b8798e2a-d2c7-409c-8eee-35eb4cf56c51"]}, "b8798e2a-d2c7-409c-8eee-35eb4cf56c51": {"id": "b8798e2a-d2c7-409c-8eee-35eb4cf56c51", "message": {"id": "b8798e2a-d2c7-409c-8eee-35eb4cf56c51", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716492811.642852, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To effectively assess the dynamics of flow-limited resources within a system, it&#x27;s essential to incorporate several key indicators into a systems dynamics model.

A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "title": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "tether_id":

Become Part of Secondary School Math Instruction\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QBrmAGcMIi8\n\n00:00:00.719 hello my name is diana fisher\n00:00:03.040 i have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james kapit proposed\n00:01:54.520 democratizing the comp concepts of\n00:01:57.280 calculus\n00:01:58.399 by providing technology-based learning\n00:02:01.280 environments\n00:02:02.479 he said new notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics learning\n00:02:14.319 sd is such a new and powerful\n00:02:18.080 notation system the audience recognizes\n00:02:21.120 these system dynamics modeling icons\n00:02:23.440 from which sd models can be constructed\n00:02:26.400 the stock\n00:02:27.280 and accumulator represents a main\n00:02:29.599 function in the model\n00:02:31.200 mathematically it operates as an\n00:02:33.519 integral does in calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants parameters or\n00:02:46.080 simple\n00:02:46.560 or arithmetic combinations of model\n00:02:49.040 components\n00:02:50.319 the connector indicates the influence of\n00:02:52.959 one\n00:02:53.360 model component on another\n00:02:55.400 mathematically\n00:02:56.800 the connectors identify the dependencies\n00:02:59.599 of one variable\n00:03:00.879 variable on another i will not take you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra students and the\n00:17:58.000 delays\n00:17:58.880 represented on the right both material\n00:18:01.360 at the top\n00:18:02.080 and information delays at the bottom\n00:18:05.039 could be understood by algebra students\n00:18:08.799 this slide identifies two websites\n00:18:12.080 with resources that you may find useful\n00:18:15.520 the first is a website that contains\n00:18:17.679 some free\n00:18:18.960 sd lessons for use with secondary school\n00:18:21.600 students\n00:18:22.480 as well as where to purchase some books\n00:18:25.039 of sd lessons that are published\n00:18:27.760 it also contains examples of secondary\n00:18:30.080 school students\n00:18:31.039 original sd model diagrams and technical\n00:18:33.919 papers\n00:18:34.480 explaining the models it advertises\n00:18:37.600 online sd courses geared to secondary\n00:18:40.640 school math and science\n00:18:42.000 teachers and shows the alignment of sd\n00:18:45.120 with u.s national educational standards\n00:18:47.600 in many disciplines\n00:18:49.440 the other website contains additional\n00:18:52.640 lessons that can be downloaded or\n00:18:54.640 purchased\n00:18:55.440 and numerous lesson books appropriate\n00:18:58.320 for\n00:18:58.640 pre-college students the experience that\n00:19:02.240 greatly enhanced my opinion about the\n00:19:04.799 virtues of using the system dynamics\n00:19:07.039 modeling approach with students\n00:19:08.960 occurred when i saw what students could\n00:19:11.120 produce\n00:19:12.000 when given the freedom to choose a\n00:19:14.160 dynamic problem that\n00:19:15.520 interested them for which they could\n00:19:17.600 create an original model\n00:19:19.520 write a technical paper explaining their\n00:19:21.760 model and present their model\n00:19:24.400 to an audience\n00:19:27.600 i wanted to prepare students to identify\n00:19:31.280 and analyze\n00:19:32.240 problems in the world from which\n00:19:35.600 they could gain an understanding by\n00:19:37.760 building system dynamics models\n00:19:40.320 i wanted them to develop skill in model\n00:19:43.039 building\n00:19:43.760 in analyzing model design in output and\n00:19:47.120 feedback\n00:19:47.760 and in explaining what they learned so i\n00:19:50.480 designed a secondary school\n00:19:52.640 system dynamics modeling course that i\n00:19:54.799 taught for 20 years\n00:19:56.640 one of the most important lessons i\n00:19:58.640 included in my sd modeling course was to\n00:20:01.120 show students how to translate\n00:20:03.440 a systems problem found in a news\n00:20:05.919 article\n00:20:06.559 into a stock flow diagram students\n00:20:09.360 listed the most important variables\n00:20:11.520 they built the structure of their model\n00:20:13.280 by hand and they also sketched out the\n00:20:15.440 feedback\n00:20:16.159 students indicated that this was one of\n00:20:18.080 the most important lessons in preparing\n00:20:20.640 them to do their final project\n00:20:22.880 i&#x27;m going to magnify this bottom part\n00:20:26.000 so you can see it a little bit better\n00:20:29.760 i know it&#x27;s blurry but it&#x27;s because i\n00:20:32.480 just used the previous picture to\n00:20:34.159 magnify it\n00:20:35.280 but you can see the design of their\n00:20:37.280 model structure you can see their\n00:20:38.960 feedback loop\n00:20:40.159 they&#x27;re doing behavior over time graphs\n00:20:42.320 all of this was part of the lesson\n00:20:44.320 for analyzing an article in the news i&#x27;m\n00:20:47.200 now going to show you\n00:20:48.559 some sample student original sd models\n00:20:52.000 in 2007 when the united states was\n00:20:54.720 experiencing an oil crisis\n00:20:57.200 this student observed that many people\n00:20:59.120 were trying unsuccessfully to buy hybrid\n00:21:02.080 cars this was his idea of why\n00:21:05.760 the problem happened it actually is\n00:21:08.000 broken into three segments\n00:21:10.559 there is the hybrid car segment at the\n00:21:13.440 top\n00:21:14.400 i&#x27;ll go back hybrid car production\n00:21:18.880 hybrid inventory and active\n00:21:21.919 hybrid in vehicles\n00:21:25.360 there is a factory capacity which was a\n00:21:28.799 limiting factor on being able to produce\n00:21:31.200 enough cars\n00:21:32.400 and then there was a backlog of orders\n00:21:35.039 and perceived backlogged\n00:21:37.039 that prospective buyers weren&#x27;t going to\n00:21:39.919 get\n00:21:40.559 a car very soon even if they ordered one\n00:21:44.000 his model did not start an equilibrium\n00:21:46.400 unfortunately\n00:21:47.679 so let&#x27;s ignore the first part of the\n00:21:49.440 graph and and focus on the spike in oil\n00:21:52.640 prices\n00:21:53.520 at week 30. the new demand which is the\n00:21:56.720 pink\n00:21:57.440 curve spikes upward for hybrid cars\n00:22:01.760 that is quickly followed by a spike in\n00:22:04.159 the backlog demand for hybrid cars which\n00:22:06.640 is the brown graph\n00:22:08.400 the price of hybrid cars which is the\n00:22:10.880 green curve shows an\n00:22:12.480 increase as backlog increases the blue\n00:22:15.520 line\n00:22:16.080 which is on a scale by itself is the\n00:22:18.480 number of active hybrid cars\n00:22:20.720 and that is steadily increasing\n00:22:24.000 the first year i introduced material and\n00:22:26.400 information delays to my students\n00:22:28.559 many students understood the ideas\n00:22:30.559 immediately\n00:22:32.080 this student started his model on\n00:22:34.320 workforce pressure\n00:22:35.840 using the idea of three delays so\n00:22:38.960 here we have employees\n00:22:42.080 who are being hired and fired this is\n00:22:45.120 the amount of\n00:22:46.159 work that the company wants done\n00:22:50.080 this is the perceived satisfaction of\n00:22:53.200 the current working people\n00:22:55.120 and up here is the pay that is given\n00:22:58.960 to the workers the three\n00:23:02.320 delays here are an information delay\n00:23:06.000 down in the perceived satisfaction\n00:23:09.280 and information delay in hiring and\nThe

Part of Secondary School Math Instruction\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QBrmAGcMIi8\n\n00:00:00.719 hello my name is diana fisher\n00:00:03.040 i have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james kapit proposed\n00:01:54.520 democratizing the comp concepts of\n00:01:57.280 calculus\n00:01:58.399 by providing technology-based learning\n00:02:01.280 environments\n00:02:02.479 he said new notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics learning\n00:02:14.319 sd is such a new and powerful\n00:02:18.080 notation system the audience recognizes\n00:02:21.120 these system dynamics modeling icons\n00:02:23.440 from which sd models can be constructed\n00:02:26.400 the stock\n00:02:27.280 and accumulator represents a main\n00:02:29.599 function in the model\n00:02:31.200 mathematically it operates as an\n00:02:33.519 integral does in calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants parameters or\n00:02:46.080 simple\n00:02:46.560 or arithmetic combinations of model\n00:02:49.040 components\n00:02:50.319 the connector indicates the influence of\n00:02:52.959 one\n00:02:53.360 model component on another\n00:02:55.400 mathematically\n00:02:56.800 the connectors identify the dependencies\n00:02:59.599 of one variable\n00:03:00.879 variable on another i will not take you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra students and the\n00:17:58.000 delays\n00:17:58.880 represented on the right both material\n00:18:01.360 at the top\n00:18:02.080 and information delays at the bottom\n00:18:05.039 could be understood by algebra students\n00:18:08.799 this slide identifies two websites\n00:18:12.080 with resources that you may find useful\n00:18:15.520 the first is a website that contains\n00:18:17.679 some free\n00:18:18.960 sd lessons for use with secondary school\n00:18:21.600 students\n00:18:22.480 as well as where to purchase some books\n00:18:25.039 of sd lessons that are published\n00:18:27.760 it also contains examples of secondary\n00:18:30.080 school students\n00:18:31.039 original sd model diagrams and technical\n00:18:33.919 papers\n00:18:34.480 explaining the models it advertises\n00:18:37.600 online sd courses geared to secondary\n00:18:40.640 school math and science\n00:18:42.000 teachers and shows the alignment of sd\n00:18:45.120 with u.s national educational standards\n00:18:47.600 in many disciplines\n00:18:49.440 the other website contains additional\n00:18:52.640 lessons that can be downloaded or\n00:18:54.640 purchased\n00:18:55.440 and numerous lesson books appropriate\n00:18:58.320 for\n00:18:58.640 pre-college students the experience that\n00:19:02.240 greatly enhanced my opinion about the\n00:19:04.799 virtues of using the system dynamics\n00:19:07.039 modeling approach with students\n00:19:08.960 occurred when i saw what students could\n00:19:11.120 produce\n00:19:12.000 when given the freedom to choose a\n00:19:14.160 dynamic problem that\n00:19:15.520 interested them for which they could\n00:19:17.600 create an original model\n00:19:19.520 write a technical paper explaining their\n00:19:21.760 model and present their model\n00:19:24.400 to an audience\n00:19:27.600 i wanted to prepare students to identify\n00:19:31.280 and analyze\n00:19:32.240 problems in the world from which\n00:19:35.600 they could gain an understanding by\n00:19:37.760 building system dynamics models\n00:19:40.320 i wanted them to develop skill in model\n00:19:43.039 building\n00:19:43.760 in analyzing model design in output and\n00:19:47.120 feedback\n00:19:47.760 and in explaining what they learned so i\n00:19:50.480 designed a secondary school\n00:19:52.640 system dynamics modeling course that i\n00:19:54.799 taught for 20 years\n00:19:56.640 one of the most important lessons i\n00:19:58.640 included in my sd modeling course was to\n00:20:01.120 show students how to translate\n00:20:03.440 a systems problem found in a news\n00:20:05.919 article\n00:20:06.559 into a stock flow diagram students\n00:20:09.360 listed the most important variables\n00:20:11.520 they built the structure of their model\n00:20:13.280 by hand and they also sketched out the\n00:20:15.440 feedback\n00:20:16.159 students indicated that this was one of\n00:20:18.080 the most important lessons in preparing\n00:20:20.640 them to do their final project\n00:20:22.880 i&#x27;m going to magnify this bottom part\n00:20:26.000 so you can see it a little bit better\n00:20:29.760 i know it&#x27;s blurry but it&#x27;s because i\n00:20:32.480 just used the previous picture to\n00:20:34.159 magnify it\n00:20:35.280 but you can see the design of their\n00:20:37.280 model structure you can see their\n00:20:38.960 feedback loop\n00:20:40.159 they&#x27;re doing behavior over time graphs\n00:20:42.320 all of this was part of the lesson\n00:20:44.320 for analyzing an article in the news i&#x27;m\n00:20:47.200 now going to show you\n00:20:48.559 some sample student original sd models\n00:20:52.000 in 2007 when the united states was\n00:20:54.720 experiencing an oil crisis\n00:20:57.200 this student observed that many people\n00:20:59.120 were trying unsuccessfully to buy hybrid\n00:21:02.080 cars this was his idea of why\n00:21:05.760 the problem happened it actually is\n00:21:08.000 broken into three segments\n00:21:10.559 there is the hybrid car segment at the\n00:21:13.440 top\n00:21:14.400 i&#x27;ll go back hybrid car production\n00:21:18.880 hybrid inventory and active\n00:21:21.919 hybrid in vehicles\n00:21:25.360 there is a factory capacity which was a\n00:21:28.799 limiting factor on being able to produce\n00:21:31.200 enough cars\n00:21:32.400 and then there was a backlog of orders\n00:21:35.039 and perceived backlogged\n00:21:37.039 that prospective buyers weren&#x27;t going to\n00:21:39.919 get\n00:21:40.559 a car very soon even if they ordered one\n00:21:44.000 his model did not start an equilibrium\n00:21:46.400 unfortunately\n00:21:47.679 so let&#x27;s ignore the first part of the\n00:21:49.440 graph and and focus on the spike in oil\n00:21:52.640 prices\n00:21:53.520 at week 30. the new demand which is the\n00:21:56.720 pink\n00:21:57.440 curve spikes upward for hybrid cars\n00:22:01.760 that is quickly followed by a spike in\n00:22:04.159 the backlog demand for hybrid cars which\n00:22:06.640 is the brown graph\n00:22:08.400 the price of hybrid cars which is the\n00:22:10.880 green curve shows an\n00:22:12.480 increase as backlog increases the blue\n00:22:15.520 line\n00:22:16.080 which is on a scale by itself is the\n00:22:18.480 number of active hybrid cars\n00:22:20.720 and that is steadily increasing\n00:22:24.000 the first year i introduced material and\n00:22:26.400 information delays to my students\n00:22:28.559 many students understood the ideas\n00:22:30.559 immediately\n00:22:32.080 this student started his model on\n00:22:34.320 workforce pressure\n00:22:35.840 using the idea of three delays so\n00:22:38.960 here we have employees\n00:22:42.080 who are being hired and fired this is\n00:22:45.120 the amount of\n00:22:46.159 work that the company wants done\n00:22:50.080 this is the perceived satisfaction of\n00:22:53.200 the current working people\n00:22:55.120 and up here is the pay that is given\n00:22:58.960 to the workers the three\n00:23:02.320 delays here are an information delay\n00:23:06.000 down in the perceived satisfaction\n00:23:09.280 and information delay in hiring and\nThe

have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james kapit proposed\n00:01:54.520 democratizing the comp concepts of\n00:01:57.280 calculus\n00:01:58.399 by providing technology-based learning\n00:02:01.280 environments\n00:02:02.479 he said new notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics learning\n00:02:14.319 sd is such a new and powerful\n00:02:18.080 notation system the audience recognizes\n00:02:21.120 these system dynamics modeling icons\n00:02:23.440 from which sd models can be constructed\n00:02:26.400 the stock\n00:02:27.280 and accumulator represents a main\n00:02:29.599 function in the model\n00:02:31.200 mathematically it operates as an\n00:02:33.519 integral does in calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants parameters or\n00:02:46.080 simple\n00:02:46.560 or arithmetic combinations of model\n00:02:49.040 components\n00:02:50.319 the connector indicates the influence of\n00:02:52.959 one\n00:02:53.360 model component on another\n00:02:55.400 mathematically\n00:02:56.800 the connectors identify the dependencies\n00:02:59.599 of one variable\n00:03:00.879 variable on another i will not take you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra students and the\n00:17:58.000 delays\n00:17:58.880 represented on the right both material\n00:18:01.360 at the top\n00:18:02.080 and information delays at the bottom\n00:18:05.039 could be understood by algebra students\n00:18:08.799 this slide identifies two websites\n00:18:12.080 with resources that you may find useful\n00:18:15.520 the first is a website that contains\n00:18:17.679 some free\n00:18:18.960 sd lessons for use with secondary school\n00:18:21.600 students\n00:18:22.480 as well as where to purchase some books\n00:18:25.039 of sd lessons that are published\n00:18:27.760 it also contains examples of secondary\n00:18:30.080 school students\n00:18:31.039 original sd model diagrams and technical\n00:18:33.919 papers\n00:18:34.480 explaining the models it advertises\n00:18:37.600 online sd courses geared to secondary\n00:18:40.640 school math and science\n00:18:42.000 teachers and shows the alignment of sd\n00:18:45.120 with u.s national educational standards\n00:18:47.600 in many disciplines\n00:18:49.440 the other website contains additional\n00:18:52.640 lessons that can be downloaded or\n00:18:54.640 purchased\n00:18:55.440 and numerous lesson books appropriate\n00:18:58.320 for\n00:18:58.640 pre-college students the experience that\n00:19:02.240 greatly enhanced my opinion about the\n00:19:04.799 virtues of using the system dynamics\n00:19:07.039 modeling approach with students\n00:19:08.960 occurred when i saw what students could\n00:19:11.120 produce\n00:19:12.000 when given the freedom to choose a\n00:19:14.160 dynamic problem that\n00:19:15.520 interested them for which they could\n00:19:17.600 create an original model\n00:19:19.520 write a technical paper explaining their\n00:19:21.760 model and present their model\n00:19:24.400 to an audience\n00:19:27.600 i wanted to prepare students to identify\n00:19:31.280 and analyze\n00:19:32.240 problems in the world from which\n00:19:35.600 they could gain an understanding by\n00:19:37.760 building system dynamics models\n00:19:40.320 i wanted them to develop skill in model\n00:19:43.039 building\n00:19:43.760 in analyzing model design in output and\n00:19:47.120 feedback\n00:19:47.760 and in explaining what they learned so i\n00:19:50.480 designed a secondary school\n00:19:52.640 system dynamics modeling course that i\n00:19:54.799 taught for 20 years\n00:19:56.640 one of the most important lessons i\n00:19:58.640 included in my sd modeling course was to\n00:20:01.120 show students how to translate\n00:20:03.440 a systems problem found in a news\n00:20:05.919 article\n00:20:06.559 into a stock flow diagram students\n00:20:09.360 listed the most important variables\n00:20:11.520 they built the structure of their model\n00:20:13.280 by hand and they also sketched out the\n00:20:15.440 feedback\n00:20:16.159 students indicated that this was one of\n00:20:18.080 the most important lessons in preparing\n00:20:20.640 them to do their final project\n00:20:22.880 i&#x27;m going to magnify this bottom part\n00:20:26.000 so you can see it a little bit better\n00:20:29.760 i know it&#x27;s blurry but it&#x27;s because i\n00:20:32.480 just used the previous picture to\n00:20:34.159 magnify it\n00:20:35.280 but you can see the design of their\n00:20:37.280 model structure you can see their\n00:20:38.960 feedback loop\n00:20:40.159 they&#x27;re doing behavior over time graphs\n00:20:42.320 all of this was part of the lesson\n00:20:44.320 for analyzing an article in the news i&#x27;m\n00:20:47.200 now going to show you\n00:20:48.559 some sample student original sd models\n00:20:52.000 in 2007 when the united states was\n00:20:54.720 experiencing an oil crisis\n00:20:57.200 this student observed that many people\n00:20:59.120 were trying unsuccessfully to buy hybrid\n00:21:02.080 cars this was his idea of why\n00:21:05.760 the problem happened it actually is\n00:21:08.000 broken into three segments\n00:21:10.559 there is the hybrid car segment at the\n00:21:13.440 top\n00:21:14.400 i&#x27;ll go back hybrid car production\n00:21:18.880 hybrid inventory and active\n00:21:21.919 hybrid in vehicles\n00:21:25.360 there is a factory capacity which was a\n00:21:28.799 limiting factor on being able to produce\n00:21:31.200 enough cars\n00:21:32.400 and then there was a backlog of orders\n00:21:35.039 and perceived backlogged\n00:21:37.039 that prospective buyers weren&#x27;t going to\n00:21:39.919 get\n00:21:40.559 a car very soon even if they ordered one\n00:21:44.000 his model did not start an equilibrium\n00:21:46.400 unfortunately\n00:21:47.679 so let&#x27;s ignore the first part of the\n00:21:49.440 graph and and focus on the spike in oil\n00:21:52.640 prices\n00:21:53.520 at week 30. the new demand which is the\n00:21:56.720 pink\n00:21:57.440 curve spikes upward for hybrid cars\n00:22:01.760 that is quickly followed by a spike in\n00:22:04.159 the backlog demand for hybrid cars which\n00:22:06.640 is the brown graph\n00:22:08.400 the price of hybrid cars which is the\n00:22:10.880 green curve shows an\n00:22:12.480 increase as backlog increases the blue\n00:22:15.520 line\n00:22:16.080 which is on a scale by itself is the\n00:22:18.480 number of active hybrid cars\n00:22:20.720 and that is steadily increasing\n00:22:24.000 the first year i introduced material and\n00:22:26.400 information delays to my students\n00:22:28.559 many students understood the ideas\n00:22:30.559 immediately\n00:22:32.080 this student started his model

resources within a system, it&#x27;s essential to incorporate several key indicators into a systems dynamics model.

Stocks are foundational for monitoring the resource levels and serve as a baseline for measuring changes over time.\n\nFlows describe the movement of resources between stocks or from external sources into the system.

A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "title": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa210c0-9c97-48b4-93dd-a33d6e7900e7", "request_id": "88878f015a940e6f-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa210c0-9c97-48b4-93dd-a33d6e7900e7", "children": ["5191b4a9-6bad-4624-bf30-64051e16b602"]}, "5191b4a9-6bad-4624-bf30-64051e16b602": {"id": "5191b4a9-6bad-4624-bf30-64051e16b602", "message": {"id": "5191b4a9-6bad-4624-bf30-64051e16b602", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716493678.426769, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, the assertions in your description about the components of a systems dynamics model\u2014stocks, flows, converters/constants, and information flows\u2014are directly supported by the information in the attached document, &quot;Chapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems&quot; from the &quot;v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf&quot; document.\n\n- **Stocks** are indeed described as quantities of resources available within the system, akin to your example of water in a reservoir or a population count in an ecological study.

A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 56, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source"}, "url": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9"}}, {"start_ix": 980, "end_ix": 991, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "file", "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "id": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9", "source": "my_files", "text": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 56, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source"}, "url": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9"}}, {"start_ix": 1265, "end_ix": 1276, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "file", "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "id": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9", "source": "my_files", "text": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%.

With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 56, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source"}, "url": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9"}}, {"start_ix": 1576, "end_ix": 1587, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "file", "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "id": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9", "source": "my_files", "text": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 56, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source"}, "url": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9"}}], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "7586dd5b-9166-4018-8396-f4b831cfff8d", "request_id": "88878f015a940e6f-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "content_references": [{"matched_text": "\u301056\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 577, "end_idx": 588, "alt": null, "type": "file", "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "id": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9", "source": "my_files", "snippet": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "cloud_doc_url": null}, {"matched_text": "\u301056\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 980, "end_idx": 991, "alt": null, "type": "file", "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "id": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9", "source": "my_files", "snippet": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J.

New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "cloud_doc_url": null}, {"matched_text": "\u301056\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1265, "end_idx": 1276, "alt": null, "type": "file", "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "id": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9", "source": "my_files", "snippet": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "cloud_doc_url": null}, {"matched_text": "\u301056\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1576, "end_idx": 1587, "alt": null, "type": "file", "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "id": "file-M0PCKNpTusz4oeTcXy2EOFv9", "source": "my_files", "snippet": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "cloud_doc_url": null}]}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7586dd5b-9166-4018-8396-f4b831cfff8d", "children": ["aaa2b006-e1f8-46ae-9d36-9616986b12e9"]}, "aaa2b006-e1f8-46ae-9d36-9616986b12e9": {"id": "aaa2b006-e1f8-46ae-9d36-9616986b12e9", "message": {"id": "aaa2b006-e1f8-46ae-9d36-9616986b12e9", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716493855.601461, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\nWhen modeling flow-limited resources, the inputs to consider include:\n- **Rate of resource renewal**: How quickly the resource replenishes naturally or through managed renewal processes.\n- **Consumption rate**: The speed at which the resource is being used by various processes or entities.\n- **External factors influencing availability**: This can include environmental conditions, regulatory policies, and technological changes that affect the resource&#x27;s flow.\n\nIn contrast, a model of stock-limited resources would primarily focus on:\n- **Absolute quantity of the resource available**: The total amount of resource in existence or accessible for use, such as fossil fuels or minerals.\n- **Extraction or harvest rates**: How the resource is being depleted over time.\n- **Regeneration capabilities**: Whether and how the resource can be replenished naturally or artificially over a long period.\n\nThe key difference lies in the focus on the rate of flow and renewal in flow-limited models, which are dynamic and change over time depending on usage patterns and replenishment strategies.

This approach emphasizes the depletion of a fixed stock, highlighting the limits of availability and the critical need for conservation and efficient use.\n\nThe main difference between these two models lies in their focus and application. Flow-limited models are dynamic, reflecting continuous changes in resource flows and the effects of various influencing factors. They are particularly useful when resources can be renewed or are affected by external conditions. On the other hand, stock-limited models deal with resources that have fixed availability, concentrating on managing finite supplies and preventing exhaustion. Understanding these differences is crucial for policymakers, businesses, and conservationists. It helps in developing effective strategies for resource management, ensuring sustainability, and tackling the challenges posed by limited natural resources.\n\n\nCan you notate in the passage above which document each paragraph seems to be citing? \n "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-oLa0heWJnzyCmDOIDMrVRbRl", "size": 29388, "name": "tactiq-free-transcript-QBrmAGcMIi8.txt", "mime_type": "text/plain"}, {"id": "file-zOTPP4kr8vUXBo6kFBD1ojOe", "size": 356629, "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf"}], "request_id": "8887ce43ae134bf0-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "24d0aff2-8269-4f88-983e-e0fccfef9fae", "children": ["eb4d940d-4b25-44a3-9e2e-abd1f07c9585"]}, "eb4d940d-4b25-44a3-9e2e-abd1f07c9585": {"id": "eb4d940d-4b25-44a3-9e2e-abd1f07c9585", "message": {"id": "eb4d940d-4b25-44a3-9e2e-abd1f07c9585", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716496261.14191, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "file-zOTPP4kr8vUXBo6kFBD1ojOe", "domain": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "text": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "title": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "tether_id":

Become Part of Secondary School Math Instruction\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QBrmAGcMIi8\n\n00:00:00.719 hello my name is diana fisher\n00:00:03.040 i have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james kapit proposed\n00:01:54.520 democratizing the comp concepts of\n00:01:57.280 calculus\n00:01:58.399 by providing technology-based learning\n00:02:01.280 environments\n00:02:02.479 he said new notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics learning\n00:02:14.319 sd is such a new and powerful\n00:02:18.080 notation system the audience recognizes\n00:02:21.120 these system dynamics modeling icons\n00:02:23.440 from which sd models can be constructed\n00:02:26.400 the stock\n00:02:27.280 and accumulator represents a main\n00:02:29.599 function in the model\n00:02:31.200 mathematically it operates as an\n00:02:33.519 integral does in calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants parameters or\n00:02:46.080 simple\n00:02:46.560 or arithmetic combinations of model\n00:02:49.040 components\n00:02:50.319 the connector indicates the influence of\n00:02:52.959 one\n00:02:53.360 model component on another\n00:02:55.400 mathematically\n00:02:56.800 the connectors identify the dependencies\n00:02:59.599 of one variable\n00:03:00.879 variable on another i will not take you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra students and the\n00:17:58.000 delays\n00:17:58.880 represented on the right both material\n00:18:01.360 at the top\n00:18:02.080 and information delays at the bottom\n00:18:05.039 could be understood by algebra students\n00:18:08.799 this slide identifies two websites\n00:18:12.080 with resources that you may find useful\n00:18:15.520 the first is a website that contains\n00:18:17.679 some free\n00:18:18.960 sd lessons for use with secondary school\n00:18:21.600 students\n00:18:22.480 as well as where to purchase some books\n00:18:25.039 of sd lessons that are published\n00:18:27.760 it also contains examples of secondary\n00:18:30.080 school students\n00:18:31.039 original sd model diagrams and technical\n00:18:33.919 papers\n00:18:34.480 explaining the models it advertises\n00:18:37.600 online sd courses geared to secondary\n00:18:40.640 school math and science\n00:18:42.000 teachers and shows the alignment of sd\n00:18:45.120 with u.s national educational standards\n00:18:47.600 in many disciplines\n00:18:49.440 the other website contains additional\n00:18:52.640 lessons that can be downloaded or\n00:18:54.640 purchased\n00:18:55.440 and numerous lesson books appropriate\n00:18:58.320 for\n00:18:58.640 pre-college students the experience that\n00:19:02.240 greatly enhanced my opinion about the\n00:19:04.799 virtues of using the system dynamics\n00:19:07.039 modeling approach with students\n00:19:08.960 occurred when i saw what students could\n00:19:11.120 produce\n00:19:12.000 when given the freedom to choose a\n00:19:14.160 dynamic problem that\n00:19:15.520 interested them for which they could\n00:19:17.600 create an original model\n00:19:19.520 write a technical paper explaining their\n00:19:21.760 model and present their model\n00:19:24.400 to an audience\n00:19:27.600 i wanted to prepare students to identify\n00:19:31.280 and analyze\n00:19:32.240 problems in the world from which\n00:19:35.600 they could gain an understanding by\n00:19:37.760 building system dynamics models\n00:19:40.320 i wanted them to develop skill in model\n00:19:43.039 building\n00:19:43.760 in analyzing model design in output and\n00:19:47.120 feedback\n00:19:47.760 and in explaining what they learned so i\n00:19:50.480 designed a secondary school\n00:19:52.640 system dynamics modeling course that i\n00:19:54.799 taught for 20 years\n00:19:56.640 one of the most important lessons i\n00:19:58.640 included in my sd modeling course was to\n00:20:01.120 show students how to translate\n00:20:03.440 a systems problem found in a news\n00:20:05.919 article\n00:20:06.559 into a stock flow diagram students\n00:20:09.360 listed the most important variables\n00:20:11.520 they built the structure of their model\n00:20:13.280 by hand and they also sketched out the\n00:20:15.440 feedback\n00:20:16.159 students indicated that this was one of\n00:20:18.080 the most important lessons in preparing\n00:20:20.640 them to do their final project\n00:20:22.880 i&#x27;m going to magnify this bottom part\n00:20:26.000 so you can see it a little bit better\n00:20:29.760 i know it&#x27;s blurry but it&#x27;s because i\n00:20:32.480 just used the previous picture to\n00:20:34.159 magnify it\n00:20:35.280 but you can see the design of their\n00:20:37.280 model structure you can see their\n00:20:38.960 feedback loop\n00:20:40.159 they&#x27;re doing behavior over time graphs\n00:20:42.320 all of this was part of the lesson\n00:20:44.320 for analyzing an article in the news i&#x27;m\n00:20:47.200 now going to show you\n00:20:48.559 some sample student original sd models\n00:20:52.000 in 2007 when the united states was\n00:20:54.720 experiencing an oil crisis\n00:20:57.200 this student observed that many people\n00:20:59.120 were trying unsuccessfully to buy hybrid\n00:21:02.080 cars this was his idea of why\n00:21:05.760 the problem happened it actually is\n00:21:08.000 broken into three segments\n00:21:10.559 there is the hybrid car segment at the\n00:21:13.440 top\n00:21:14.400 i&#x27;ll go back hybrid car production\n00:21:18.880 hybrid inventory and active\n00:21:21.919 hybrid in vehicles\n00:21:25.360 there is a factory capacity which was a\n00:21:28.799 limiting factor on being able to produce\n00:21:31.200 enough cars\n00:21:32.400 and then there was a backlog of orders\n00:21:35.039 and perceived backlogged\n00:21:37.039 that prospective buyers weren&#x27;t going to\n00:21:39.919 get\n00:21:40.559 a car very soon even if they ordered one\n00:21:44.000 his model did not start an equilibrium\n00:21:46.400 unfortunately\n00:21:47.679 so let&#x27;s ignore the first part of the\n00:21:49.440 graph and and focus on the spike in oil\n00:21:52.640 prices\n00:21:53.520 at week 30. the new demand which is the\n00:21:56.720 pink\n00:21:57.440 curve spikes upward for hybrid cars\n00:22:01.760 that is quickly followed by a spike in\n00:22:04.159 the backlog demand for hybrid cars which\n00:22:06.640 is the brown graph\n00:22:08.400 the price of hybrid cars which is the\n00:22:10.880 green curve shows an\n00:22:12.480 increase as backlog increases the blue\n00:22:15.520 line\n00:22:16.080 which is on a scale by itself is the\n00:22:18.480 number of active hybrid cars\n00:22:20.720 and that is steadily increasing\n00:22:24.000 the first year i introduced material and\n00:22:26.400 information delays to my students\n00:22:28.559 many students understood the ideas\n00:22:30.559 immediately\n00:22:32.080 this student started his model on\n00:22:34.320 workforce pressure\n00:22:35.840 using the idea of three delays so\n00:22:38.960 here we have employees\n00:22:42.080 who are being hired and fired this is\n00:22:45.120 the amount of\n00:22:46.159 work that the company wants done\n00:22:50.080 this is the perceived satisfaction of\n00:22:53.200 the current working people\n00:22:55.120 and up here is the pay that is given\n00:22:58.960 to the workers the three\n00:23:02.320 delays here are an information delay\n00:23:06.000 down in the perceived satisfaction\n00:23:09.280 and information delay in hiring and\nThe

Describe why these are important and relate and apply the three dimensions to your learning from earlier modules.According to Onat et al. (2017) three key dimensions of improvement are suggested to enhance the effectiveness of sustainability assessments. These dimensions include the integration of environmental economic and social dimensions the application of systems thinking and the active engagement of stakeholders. Each of these elements is vital for constructing a holistic and effective approach to sustainability that transcends the limitations often imposed by capitalist systems which typically prioritize profit at the expense of environmental and social equity.\nThe overall approach to sustainability presented by Onat et al. (2017) emphasizes the necessity of considering the environmental economic and social impacts of products or services throughout their lifecycle. It stands in contrast to and challenges the capitalist tendency to focus solely on economic gains by highlighting the interconnectedness of these dimensions. Ignoring any of these aspects can lead to solutions that might appear beneficial in one area but are detrimental in others.Systems thinking requires understanding the complete lifecycle of a product or service\u2014from raw material extraction to disposal\u2014and identifying potential impacts at each stage. This method helps in pinpointing critical points for intervention and prevents unintended consequences that could arise from changes made in isolation. One can clearly see the links between systems thinking and the ideas presented by Ostrum (1997)  which expands the rational choice models to incorporate collective actions that better address complex social dilemmas. It challenges simplistic linear thinking\u2014common in capitalist approaches\u2014that often overlook long-term consequences for immediate profit.\nFinally engaging stakeholders across the lifecycle of a product or service ensures that the diverse values and needs of different groups are considered and addressed in the sustainability assessment process. This approach is crucial for democratizing decision-making processes which often are controlled top-down in capitalist structures. Fisher\u2019s (2020) discussions on how system dynamics modeling can involve stakeholders in understanding and managing complex systems effectively provide a solid argument for stakeholder engagement across the lifecycle. \nBy applying these three dimensions to the broader discussions from earlier modules it becomes evident how these principles can help counteract the equity and sustainability challenges exacerbated by capitalist systems. These dimensions advocate for a more inclusive holistic and long-term approach to sustainability that aligns with social equity and environmental stewardship rather than focusing narrowly on immediate economic outcomes. This integrated approach not only critiques but actively challenges the inequities perpetuated by capitalist systems paving the way for more sustainable and equitable global practices.\n\nPart 2: What indicators are required to assess the systems dynamics of flow-limited resources? \nTo effectively assess the dynamics of flow-limited resources within a system a systems dynamics model must incorporate several key indicators. These indicators include stocks flows converters/constants and information flows each playing a crucial role in understanding and predicting system behaviors.\nStocks represent the quantities of resources available within the system at any given time. These could be tangible elements like water in a reservoir or abstract quantities such as carbon or even a population count in an ecological study. Stocks are foundational for monitoring resource levels and serve as a baseline for measuring changes over time (Reuter 2013)\nFlows describe the movement of resources between stocks or from external sources into the system. This includes inputs and outputs measured over specific time intervals such as liters of water per hour or tons of carbon per year. Understanding flows is critical for assessing how resources are utilized and replenished within the system providing insights into sustainability and efficiency (Reuter 2013).\nConverters/constants are parameters within the model that affect flows or stocks but remain unchanged regardless of system dynamics. These could include growth rate constants conversion efficiencies or fixed loss rates which are essential for stabilizing the model and making accurate predictions (Reuter 2013).\nInformation flows represent the non-material connections that influence system components by altering flows or converters based on the state of stocks or other variables. This aspect of systems dynamics is crucial for modeling feedback mechanisms and adaptive behaviors within the system allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how changes in one part of the system can ripple through to others (Reuter 2013).\nBy integrating these components into a systems dynamics model it is possible to construct a comprehensive view of how resources are interlinked and governed by various dynamic factors. This holistic approach is vital for predicting future system states under different scenarios and for making informed decisions about resource management and conservation.\nWhat inputs might be incorporated into a model of flow-limited resources? How is this different from stock-limited resources? In resource management two distinct modeling approaches are used to predict and understand resource availability and sustainability: flow-limited and stock-limited models.\nFlow-limited models focus on the dynamics of resource renewal and consumption. These models consider key inputs like the rate at which a resource regenerates whether naturally or through human efforts. They also analyze the consumption rate to see how quickly the resource is being used by various entities or processes. Additionally factors like environmental conditions regulatory policies and technological changes play significant roles in influencing resource availability and flow. This model is dynamic adapting to changes in usage patterns and replenishment strategies providing a flexible framework for forecasting future resource statuses (Reuter 2013).\nIn contrast stock-limited models are concerned with the finite quantities of resources available. They focus on the absolute amount of the resource that exists or can be accessed such as fossil fuels or minerals. These models consider extraction or harvest rates detailing how quickly the resource is depleted over time. They also evaluate the resource\u2019s regeneration capabilities whether it can be naturally replenished or artificially sustained over long periods. This approach emphasizes the depletion of a fixed stock highlighting the limits of availability and the critical need for conservation and efficient use (Reuter 2013).\nThe main difference between these two models lies in their focus and application. Flow-limited models are dynamic reflecting continuous changes in resource flows and the effects of various influencing factors. They are particularly useful when resources can be renewed or are affected by external conditions. On the other hand stock-limited models deal with resources that have fixed availability concentrating on managing finite supplies and preventing exhaustion. Understanding these differences is crucial for policymakers businesses and conservationists. It helps in developing effective strategies for resource management ensuring sustainability and tackling the challenges posed by limited natural resources (Fisher 2020).\nProvide an example of the systems dynamics of:\nA stock-limited resource (such as cobalt)\nA flow-limited resource (such as rabbits)\nDescribe what and how you would measure the inputs outputs and feedback loops (in-flow out-flow connectors or dependencies stocks and sources or sinks) in each example.

You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "title": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "tether_id":

Become Part of Secondary School Math Instruction\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QBrmAGcMIi8\n\n00:00:00.719 hello my name is diana fisher\n00:00:03.040 i have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james kapit proposed\n00:01:54.520 democratizing the comp concepts of\n00:01:57.280 calculus\n00:01:58.399 by providing technology-based learning\n00:02:01.280 environments\n00:02:02.479 he said new notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics learning\n00:02:14.319 sd is such a new and powerful\n00:02:18.080 notation system the audience recognizes\n00:02:21.120 these system dynamics modeling icons\n00:02:23.440 from which sd models can be constructed\n00:02:26.400 the stock\n00:02:27.280 and accumulator represents a main\n00:02:29.599 function in the model\n00:02:31.200 mathematically it operates as an\n00:02:33.519 integral does in calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants parameters or\n00:02:46.080 simple\n00:02:46.560 or arithmetic combinations of model\n00:02:49.040 components\n00:02:50.319 the connector indicates the influence of\n00:02:52.959 one\n00:02:53.360 model component on another\n00:02:55.400 mathematically\n00:02:56.800 the connectors identify the dependencies\n00:02:59.599 of one variable\n00:03:00.879 variable on another i will not take you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra

Considering a lake as a stock-limited resource, key aspects to monitor include the volume of water (the stock), inputs such as rainfall and stream inflows, and outputs like water extraction for irrigation, drinking, and evaporation. Effective management requires measuring inflow and outflow rates alongside the current water level. Feedback mechanisms, such as increased water extraction responding to agricultural demand, can lead to a decrease in stock. This might trigger regulatory responses to prevent water depletion, illustrating how policy can impact resource sustainability.\n\n### Flow-limited Resource: Olive Oil Production\n\nOlive oil production represents a flow-limited resource where the dynamics differ significantly from those of water. The stock in this scenario is the amount of olive oil produced, stored, and available for sale. Inputs include the harvest of olives and their conversion rate into oil, while outputs encompass the sale and consumption of the oil. Feedback loops might include adjustments in production rates based on market demand and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices to balance production with environmental impacts.\n\nIn both cases, a deep understanding of system dynamics helps pinpoint critical leverage points for sustainable management. For instance, conservation measures during droughts in water management can maintain water levels, while sustainable practices in olive oil production can assure consistent yields without environmental harm.\n\nThese models implicitly critique systems that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability.

Per-capita consumption of bottled water has been growing steadily and is the fastest-growing sector of the packaged beverages industry, with expected annual growth of 10% until 2026. Most bottled water is sold in PET containers, and various impacts are evident along all phases of the product lifecycle. This paper reviews market trends and forecasts, lifecycle estimates of energy consumption, associated air pollution and GHG emissions, water footprint, and waste generation. Concerns around human and ecosystem health due to pollution, land use changes, storage conditions, microplastics, and leaching from containers are described, as well as local environmental benefits from companies\u2019 efforts to preserve the quality of their source water. Growing awareness of the cumulative negative impacts of bottled water have pushed the industry to voluntarily improve its performance. Yet, as growth continues, further actions should focus on stricter regulation and on the provision of more sustainable, affordable, available, and trusted alternatives. Gaps remain in knowledge of the effects of bottled water over its full life cycle.\n\nKeywords: \n\n\u301085\u2020bottled water industry\u3011; \u301086\u2020sustainable consumption\u3011; \u301087\u2020health impact\u3011; \u301088\u2020environmental impact\u3011\n\n##  1. Introduction \n\nBottled water is often seen as one of capitalism\u2019s greatest mysteries, \u201cthe packaging and selling of something that is already freely available\u201d [\u301089\u20201\u3011]. In its massive marketing campaigns and advertisements, the industry positions bottled water as the ultimate beverage for a healthy lifestyle and associates its consumption with personal success and a connection to wild nature [\u301090\u20202\u3011]. Influenced by this messaging, the reasons consumers provide for preferring bottled water over tap water vary: some see it as the only option for clean water; for some it is a symbol of status and the modern lifestyle; for others it is simply more convenient, handier, or tastier than tap water [\u301091\u20203\u3011,\u301092\u20204\u3011,\u301093\u20205\u3011]. In many countries bottled water consumption is common in all segments of society. In the USA, for example, consumption is spread nearly evenly between age groups and income groups, with perhaps slightly more women (54%) drinking it than men [\u301094\u20206\u3011]. Considering the billions of bottles that are sold every year, the rate of industry growth, and the consumer price of bottled water often being thousands of times that of tap water, it seems that the public is convinced that bottled water is superior. This is surprising, given that most bottled water sold globally (nearly 60% in 2018) is purified tap water, not spring water or natural mineral water [\u301095\u20207\u3011].\n\nAs a commodity, bottled water is a unique combination of natural resource and industrial product. In recent decades, the social practice of drinking bottled water has engendered cultural and social shifts with economic, environmental, and social implications [\u301096\u20208\u3011]. Bottled water as a socio-techno-economic phenomenon has been widely studied from various perspectives and angles. Interest in bottled water manufacturing, consumption, and environmental impacts is reflected in the growing number of academic publications on the topic. A Web of Science database search returned 537 publications with the term \u201cbottled water\u201d in the title or keywords between 1997 and 2020 (\u301097\u2020Figure 1\u3011). The most common aspects of the bottled water issue to be addressed are health and environment (in terms of the impacts of bottled water on consumer health and the environmental impacts of single-use bottles), economics (global and local industry; market trends), psychology (why consumers prefer bottled water to tap water), and chemical and engineering aspects of the manufacturing and industrial processes. While many publications cover more than one aspect, no article provides a broad overview of bottled water as a socio-techno-economic phenomenon.\n\nIn 2011, the economics, environmental impact, and social implications of the bottled water industry and consumption trends of the product were reviewed in the Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems [\u301098\u20209\u3011]. Subsequently, despite the changes in production technologies and consumption patterns, no article has provided a broad up-to-date multi-perspective overview of the phenomenon based on data and evidence from various disciplines. Our paper aims to fill this gap by using the prism of the three pillars of sustainability\u2014economic viability, environmental impact, and social equity\u2014to examine the bottled water phenomenon. As this phenomenon is wide in scope, we apply a semi-systemic review methodology, allowing us to include a broad range of topics and different types of studies [\u301099\u202010\u3011]. Using evidence from these three realms, we observe the multifaceted reality of bottled water production and consumption.

Introduction \n\nBottled water is often seen as one of capitalism\u2019s greatest mysteries, \u201cthe packaging and selling of something that is already freely available\u201d [\u301089\u20201\u3011]. In its massive marketing campaigns and advertisements, the industry positions bottled water as the ultimate beverage for a healthy lifestyle and associates its consumption with personal success and a connection to wild nature [\u301090\u20202\u3011]. Influenced by this messaging, the reasons consumers provide for preferring bottled water over tap water vary: some see it as the only option for clean water; for some it is a symbol of status and the modern lifestyle; for others it is simply more convenient, handier, or tastier than tap water [\u301091\u20203\u3011,\u301092\u20204\u3011,\u301093\u20205\u3011]. In many countries bottled water consumption is common in all segments of society. In the USA, for example, consumption is spread nearly evenly between age groups and income groups, with perhaps slightly more women (54%) drinking it than men [\u301094\u20206\u3011]. Considering the billions of bottles that are sold every year, the rate of industry growth, and the consumer price of bottled water often being thousands of times that of tap water, it seems that the public is convinced that bottled water is superior. This is surprising, given that most bottled water sold globally (nearly 60% in 2018) is purified tap water, not spring water or natural mineral water [\u301095\u20207\u3011].\n\nAs a commodity, bottled water is a unique combination of natural resource and industrial product. In recent decades, the social practice of drinking bottled water has engendered cultural and social shifts with economic, environmental, and social implications [\u301096\u20208\u3011]. Bottled water as a socio-techno-economic phenomenon has been widely studied from various perspectives and angles. Interest in bottled water manufacturing, consumption, and environmental impacts is reflected in the growing number of academic publications on the topic. A Web of Science database search returned 537 publications with the term \u201cbottled water\u201d in the title or keywords between 1997 and 2020 (\u301097\u2020Figure 1\u3011). The most common aspects of the bottled water issue to be addressed are health and environment (in terms of the impacts of bottled water on consumer health and the environmental impacts of single-use bottles), economics (global and local industry; market trends), psychology (why consumers prefer bottled water to tap water), and chemical and engineering aspects of the manufacturing and industrial processes. While many publications cover more than one aspect, no article provides a broad overview of bottled water as a socio-techno-economic phenomenon.\n\nIn 2011, the economics, environmental impact, and social implications of the bottled water industry and consumption trends of the product were reviewed in the Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems [\u301098\u20209\u3011]. Subsequently, despite the changes in production technologies and consumption patterns, no article has provided a broad up-to-date multi-perspective overview of the phenomenon based on data and evidence from various disciplines. Our paper aims to fill this gap by using the prism of the three pillars of sustainability\u2014economic viability, environmental impact, and social equity\u2014to examine the bottled water phenomenon. As this phenomenon is wide in scope, we apply a semi-systemic review methodology, allowing us to include a broad range of topics and different types of studies [\u301099\u202010\u3011]. Using evidence from these three realms, we observe the multifaceted reality of bottled water production and consumption. Herein, we present some of the complexities and tensions inherent to consumer society, in which short-term revenues and economic considerations often come at the expense of long-term environmental and health ones. Evidence and facts should be the foundation in the search for a feasible balance between protection of the environment and human health on the one hand, and fair economic growth and social prosperity on the other.\n\nThe paper begins with a short history of the bottled water market and its evolution, follow", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "mclick", "args": ["[1, 3, 4]"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "6d051a1a-7444-43e5-acc6-ebcece7a409c", "request_id": "8887e7635d240e62-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "6d051a1a-7444-43e5-acc6-ebcece7a409c", "children": ["e7fe606f-ff71-46d6-9db7-bff40b28eabc"]}, "e7fe606f-ff71-46d6-9db7-bff40b28eabc": {"id": "e7fe606f-ff71-46d6-9db7-bff40b28eabc", "message": {"id": "e7fe606f-ff71-46d6-9db7-bff40b28eabc", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716497291.322197, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["In Italy, water management faces significant challenges due to high consumption and dependency on bottled natural spring and mineral water.

Per-capita consumption of bottled water has been growing steadily and is the fastest-growing sector of the packaged beverages industry, with expected annual growth of 10% until 2026. Most bottled water is sold in PET containers, and various impacts are evident along all phases of the product lifecycle. This paper reviews market trends and forecasts, lifecycle estimates of energy consumption, associated air pollution and GHG emissions, water footprint, and waste generation. Concerns around human and ecosystem health due to pollution, land use changes, storage conditions, microplastics, and leaching from containers are described, as well as local environmental benefits from companies\u2019 efforts to preserve the quality of their source water. Growing awareness of the cumulative negative impacts of bottled water have pushed the industry to voluntarily improve its performance. Yet, as growth continues, further actions should focus on stricter regulation and on the provision of more sustainable, affordable, available, and trusted alternatives. Gaps remain in knowledge of the effects of bottled water over its full life cycle.\n\nKeywords: \n\n\u301085\u2020bottled water industry\u3011; \u301086\u2020sustainable consumption\u3011; \u301087\u2020health impact\u3011; \u301088\u2020environmental impact\u3011\n\n##  1. Introduction \n\nBottled water is often seen as one of capitalism\u2019s greatest mysteries, \u201cthe packaging and selling of something that is already freely available\u201d [\u301089\u20201\u3011]. In its massive marketing campaigns and advertisements, the industry positions bottled water as the ultimate beverage for a healthy lifestyle and associates its consumption with personal success and a connection to wild nature [\u301090\u20202\u3011]. Influenced by this messaging, the reasons consumers provide for preferring bottled water over tap water vary: some see it as the only option for clean water; for some it is a symbol of status and the modern lifestyle; for others it is simply more convenient, handier, or tastier than tap water [\u301091\u20203\u3011,\u301092\u20204\u3011,\u301093\u20205\u3011]. In many countries bottled water consumption is common in all segments of society. In the USA, for example, consumption is spread nearly evenly between age groups and income groups, with perhaps slightly more women (54%) drinking it than men [\u301094\u20206\u3011]. Considering the billions of bottles that are sold every year, the rate of industry growth, and the consumer price of bottled water often being thousands of times that of tap water, it seems that the public is convinced that bottled water is superior. This is surprising, given that most bottled water sold globally (nearly 60% in 2018) is purified tap water, not spring water or natural mineral water [\u301095\u20207\u3011].\n\nAs a commodity, bottled water is a unique combination of natural resource and industrial product. In recent decades, the social practice of drinking bottled water has engendered cultural and social shifts with economic, environmental, and social implications [\u301096\u20208\u3011]. Bottled water as a socio-techno-economic phenomenon has been widely studied from various perspectives and angles. Interest in bottled water manufacturing, consumption, and environmental impacts is reflected in the growing number of academic publications on the topic. A Web of Science database search returned 537 publications with the term \u201cbottled water\u201d in the title or keywords between 1997 and 2020 (\u301097\u2020Figure 1\u3011). The most common aspects of the bottled water issue to be addressed are health and environment (in terms of the impacts of bottled water on consumer health and the environmental impacts of single-use bottles), economics (global and local industry; market trends), psychology (why consumers prefer bottled water to tap water), and chemical and engineering aspects of the manufacturing and industrial processes. While many publications cover more than one aspect, no article provides a broad overview of bottled water as a socio-techno-economic phenomenon.\n\nIn 2011, the economics, environmental impact, and social implications of the bottled water industry and consumption trends of the product were reviewed in the Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems [\u301098\u20209\u3011]. Subsequently, despite the changes in production technologies and consumption patterns, no article has provided a broad up-to-date multi-perspective overview of the phenomenon based on data and evidence from various disciplines. Our paper aims to fill this gap by using the prism of the three pillars of sustainability\u2014economic viability, environmental impact, and social equity\u2014to examine the bottled water phenomenon. As this phenomenon is wide in scope, we apply a semi-systemic review methodology, allowing us to include a broad range of topics and different types of studies [\u301099\u202010\u3011]. Using evidence from these three realms, we observe the multifaceted reality of bottled water production and consumption. Herein, we present some of the complexities and tensions inherent to consumer society, in which short-term revenues and economic considerations often come at the expense of long-term environmental and health ones. Evidence and facts should be the foundation in the search for a feasible balance between protection of the environment and human health on the one hand, and fair economic growth and social prosperity on the other.\n\nThe paper begins with a short history of the bottled water market and its evolution, follow"}]}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "63ba8d9c-b275-47c1-bf60-3f61f7792f4c", "children": ["aaa260f8-63ff-4131-948f-828501108bb0"]}, "aaa260f8-63ff-4131-948f-828501108bb0": {"id": "aaa260f8-63ff-4131-948f-828501108bb0", "message": {"id": "aaa260f8-63ff-4131-948f-828501108bb0", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716497457.452453, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Okay can you take all the info about bottled water, etc. and can we call bottled mineral water a stock limited resource?

Considering a lake as a stock-limited resource, key aspects to monitor include the volume of water (the stock), inputs such as rainfall and stream inflows, and outputs like water extraction for irrigation, drinking, and evaporation. Effective management requires measuring inflow and outflow rates alongside the current water level. Feedback mechanisms, such as increased water extraction responding to agricultural demand, can lead to a decrease in stock. This might trigger regulatory responses to prevent water depletion, illustrating how policy can impact resource sustainability.\n\nFlow-limited Resource: Olive Oil Production\nOlive oil production represents a flow-limited resource where the dynamics differ significantly from those of water. The stock in this scenario is the amount of olive oil produced, stored, and available for sale. Inputs include the harvest of olives and their conversion rate into oil, while outputs encompass the sale and consumption of the oil. Feedback loops might include adjustments in production rates based on market demand and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices to balance production with environmental impacts.\n\nIn both cases, a deep understanding of system dynamics helps pinpoint critical leverage points for sustainable management. For instance, conservation measures during droughts in water management can maintain water levels, while sustainable practices in olive oil production can assure consistent yields without environmental harm."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-cYVy2Dvw0r1rtCK4DFjQN3sK", "size": 29388, "name": "tactiq-free-transcript-QBrmAGcMIi8.txt", "mime_type": "text/plain"}, {"id": "file-Ayxn1ehqtVSyamaSa3SdwwIJ", "size": 356629, "name": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf"}, {"id": "file-sWDoOsSJIs2DPsZOaM958H3q", "size": 908286, "name": "Week 4_Systems Thinking for Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf"}], "request_id": "8887f38addc05a31-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c6501054-dee2-4707-9a3a-01ff9ed17e02", "children": ["80e24595-4d8e-4786-baa1-45b683b30056"]}, "80e24595-4d8e-4786-baa1-45b683b30056": {"id": "80e24595-4d8e-4786-baa1-45b683b30056", "message": {"id": "80e24595-4d8e-4786-baa1-45b683b30056", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716497803.474434, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "file-Ayxn1ehqtVSyamaSa3SdwwIJ", "domain": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "text": "\n130 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems \n \n6.1 Introduction \nEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by \nfollowing the flows of material or energy from one place or form \nto another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and \nquantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want \nto set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term \n&quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the \nword &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be \napplied to any size set of processes and resources. \n\nThis text presents one specific definition of how to characterize an \nenvironmental problem as a system of stocks and flows. We will \nbe using a limited list of characteristics of a system that can be \nused to describe many different structures and behaviors.  Our \nconstrained set of categories will help highlight the structural \nsimilarities and differences between different systems.   \n\nThis &quot;systems&quot; approach is useful for simplifying problems, \nlooking for significant processes and identifying controls. The \napproach can also be used to create simulations of future \nconditions and to communicate these to other people who are \nmaking decisions. Another of the benefits of this approach is that it \nclearly identifies the assumptions on which simulations are based. \nA good &quot;systems&quot; model is both a valuable research tool and a \nplatform for communication and decision-making. Thus, carefully \ngathering information to construct a stock and flow description of \nan environmental problem is a good example of methodically \ncollecting information that takes place in scientific research (Pielke \n2007). \n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 131 \n\n \n\n6.2 Model Components \nThere are five components that we will use to represent the \nstructure and behavior of our chosen system: stocks, flows, \ninformation flows, convertors/constants and a source/sink. An icon \nrepresents each component. For example, look at the growth of a \npopulation of rabbits (see Figure 1).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-1. A simple systems diagram for the increase in a population of rabbits \nillustrates the five objects that we will use. \nStocks are a quantity of something. Water in a tank is a good \nexample of a stock. Sometimes stocks are called reservoirs. All the \nstocks that are connected with flows will have the same units, that \nis all the stocks will be a quantity of water, or an amount of carbon, \nor the number of people, etc. In our example, the stock is the \n\n\n\n132 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nnumber of rabbits in the population. We represent this in a systems \ndiagram with a box icon. \n\nA source or sink is either has an unlimited, unchanging \nconcentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the \nsystem that we are studying. In our example, the source of new \nmatter that supports rabbit growth is not being considered. You can \nimagine another model where the amount of food available to the \nrabbit population limited the amount of new rabbits being born. In \nthis case, we would probably model the system to include the \nnutrients as a stock rather than a source/sink. A source/sink is \nrepresented as a little cloud in our diagrams. \n\nFlows connect stocks or source/sinks. The flow will increase any \nstock that it flows into or decrease a stock that it flows out of. All \nthe flows that are connected to a stock will have the units of \nwhatever the units of the stocks are per time. For example this \ncould be liters of water per hour, tons of carbon per year, or in our \nexample, rabbits per month. \n\nWhen we have information that is needed in the model as a \nconstant or we need to make a calculation, we show that as a \n&quot;converter/constant&quot;. In our example, the growth rate constant for \nthe rabbits was given as a constant. In the diagram, this is circle. \n\nInformation connectors illustrate the flow of information, not \nmaterial, from other components to either flows or converters. \nInformation cannot flow to a stock because the stocks can&#x27;t do \nanything with that information. In the simplest form, an \ninformation flow simply notifies an action of the concentration of a \nstock, the rate of flow, or the value in a converter/constant. In our \nexample, information flows brought in the values of the growth \nrate constant and the number of rabbits to the &quot;birth of new \nrabbits&quot; flow. The flow is calculated as the growth rate constant \ntimes the number of rabbits. The icon for this is a single line arrow. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 133 \n\n \n\nThese five components can be combined in flexible ways to \ndescribe the structure of different systems. An important value of \nthis approach is that the structure of the model indicates particular \ntypes of behavior and the iconography helps visualize these \nstructures. In our example of rabbit growth with unlimited \nresources (indicated by the source/sink tool), the population would \ngrow exponentially. As there are more rabbits, the number of new \nrabbits per time period will get bigger, leading to an even higher \npopulation of rabbits, and so on. A mathematical model of this \npopulation growth would give the following pattern of growth \nshown in Figure 6-2 as population vs. time. (Of course the \npopulation can&#x27;t continue to grow like this forever.) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-2. Rabbit population growth predicted from the model in \nFigure 1. The initial rabbit stock was set to 10 and the growth rate \nconstant was set to 0.1 per month. \n\nThe structure and relationships in this particular model \ndemonstrates \u201cpositive-feedback\u201d. As the stock increases, that \nincrease positively affects that flow that is leading to that stock. \nMany biological systems have this structure and function as part of \ntheir overall regulation. Sometimes this is good, such as in the \ngrowth of food crops and forests, the more crops or forests the \nfaster they grow. Sometimes this is a bad feature for humans such \n\n\n\n134 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nas the spread of a disease (the more infected people, the faster the \ndisease will spread) or the growth of invasive species. \n\nWe will examine several &quot;simple&quot; structures that are very \ncommon. These simple structures can be combined in larger \nmodels to describe very complex and busy processes. For example, \nif we were to create a model for global warming it would have \npositive and negative feedback components, open and closed \nsystems and steady state structures included making up the full \nmodel. These &quot;simple&quot; structures that we are starting with are like \nthe sentences in a larger document. You might be able to \nunderstand the individual sentences but not understand the entire \ndocument, but it is very likely that if you don&#x27;t at least understand \nthe sentences, you won&#x27;t understand the total document.  \n\n  \n6.3 Model structures and behaviors \nThe following structures and behaviors can be found in many \nlarger systems models. The analysis of a system should start with \ndetermining the extent or boundaries of the system as you plan to \nstudy it, and then look for smaller structures and then how these \nsmaller units are related. \n\nBoundaries of the system \u2013 The first step in studying or \ncommunicating information about a system is to explicitly define \nthe boundaries and what flows in and out. A &quot;closed system&quot; is one \nin which there are no source/sink components. All the flows occur \nbetween stocks. Often the decision of whether or not a system is \nopen or closed requires a judgment based on the significance of \nsome of the smaller losses or gains and a decision on the time scale \nof your study. For example, you might model a forest as a closed \nsystem for nutrients ignoring the amounts of nitrogen that comes in \nfrom rain or lost through streams. The time scale question is \napparent if, for example, you are studying the gain and loss of \nspecies in a city park but are ignoring evolution. The description \nand diagramming of a systems model should attempt to make these \nboundaries very clear. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 135 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-3: Several examples of open and closed systems. a and b \nare open, c is closed. \n \n\nPositive and negative feedback - A stock that controls the flow \ninto that stock can be described as having a negative or positive \nfeedback. Sometimes we will talk about positive or negative \nfeedback &quot;loops&quot; which are when stock A controls stock B which \nin turn eventually controls the flow into A. These feedback loops \nare crucial characteristics of systems control. Figure 1 was an \nexample of a positive feedback and the example behavior given in \nFigure 2. Figure 4 shows a system that contains a negative \nfeedback system with an example output. \n\n\n\n136 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-4. A system that contains a negative feedback control (shown in red, or \nslightly gray). The system wouldn&#x27;t work without the other components. The \nnumber of barnacles continues to increase until it hits a maximum and then it \nlevels off due to lack of any more space.  \n\n \nStock limitation - One of the powerful applications of the systems \napproach is to examine the constraints over extended periods of \ntime. Some of these are mitigated by feedback inhibition and \nothers are exacerbated by positive feedback. Stock limitation is an \nabsolute limitation on the amount of a stock that can flow to other \n\n\n\nDraft v7 137 \n\n \n\nstocks or an ultimate sink. Examples of stock limitation might be \nthe seasonal availability of nitrogen in the soil, the space trees to \ngrow, or the amount of fossil fuels available for human \nconsumption. Figure 5 presents two variations on a model for \nbacterial growth, one with and one without stock limitation. \n\na.  \n  \n\nb.  \n \n\nFigure 6-5. Stock limitation model for bacterial growth. The stock is the amount \nof nutrients in the container. In model &quot;a&quot; there is no limiting stock, in model \n&quot;b&quot; when the limiting stock runs out, the new bacteria production rate is forced \nto stop. \n\n  \nSteady state - The inflows to and outflows from a stock can create \na situation where steady state is possible. If the sum of all the \ninputs is equal to the sum of all the outputs then the value of the \nstock will not change with time. A slight increase of the input or a \n\n\n\n138 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nslight decrease of the output rate can lead to an increasing stock. \nFigure 6 illustrates a familiar example that relates to body weight. \nOther examples of steady state conditions are the CO2 \nconcentration in the atmosphere (currently not in steady state), use \nand replenishment of natural capital, or the human population at \nzero population growth.  \n\nThe conditions that lead to steady state are important to understand \nbecause the steady state may be the consequence of a very slow \ninput and very slow output, in which case not much will ever \nhappen very quickly. Conversely, the steady state could be a very \ntenuous balance between rapid input and output. With rapid fluxes, \nslight disturbance in one rate could have dramatic consequences. A \ngood example of this delicate balance is a pond in which a large \namount of algae growth is growing and contributing oxygen to the \nwater, but then with a slight change in temperature the large \namount of algae turn from a net oxygen producer to a net oxygen \nconsumer. These ponds crash into a scummy mass very quickly \nand start to stink. Simpler natural systems may be controlled by \njust a few rapid fluxes and when one of these processes changes \nthose natural systems can flip to a whole new behavior. We will \nalso examine the stability, instability and resilience of these \nenvironments in Chapter 7 using the tools of the network view. \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-6. An example of a familiar steady state problem. If the input equals \nthe output for a stock, the stock will remain constant with time, no matter how \nfast the input and output are. If the input exceeds the output, then the stock will \nincrease. In this case food input is in terms of the weight of all food eaten and \nthe food output is the weight of all excretion of waste, including the CO2 \nexhaled. The variable part of the bodyweight is \u201cfood storage\u201d that is probably \nfat. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 139 \n\n \n\n  \n6.4 Simple and busy models \nWe have shown several &quot;simple&quot; models above. These models \nhave a few components or strings of components and all the units \nfor stocks and flows are related. There are other simple models that \nmight contain two parallel paths to represent different forms of \nmaterials or energy. For example modeling energy and nitrogen in \nan ecosystem requires two sub-models; one for nitrogen and one \nfor energy that are linked by information connectors. These should \nbe treated as two simple models that have some interacting control \npoints. \n\nThe point of using the systems view is to take a complex set of \nprocesses and try to simplify it to just a few components that \ndescribe the control over the behavior. Then this model of the \nsystem can be used to make predictions about different controls or \nperturbations. \n\nSeveral examples of simple and slightly busy models are given \nbelow. A \u201cbusy\u201d model contains several \u201csimple\u201d models joined \ntogether.  For each of these examples an analysis is provided that \nserves to demonstrate how you can use this to understand \nenvironmental problems. \n\n \nExample 1: Changes in human population in a country.  \n\nThe current population plus additions from births or immigration \nand minus losses from death or emigration determines the new \npopulation level. If the birth rate is higher than the death rate even \nby a little bit, the population can experience an exponential growth \nrate. In many countries, industrialization has lead to a decreased \ndeath rate followed by a decreased birth rate. The overall side \neffect of industrialization on the population has been to stabilize of \npopulation size. Some countries however, are stalled at a level of \nindustrial development that has resulted in a decrease in the death \nrate but left the birth rate high. These countries are experiencing \nrapid population growth rates. \n\n\n\n140 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-7. Population change. The population increases from birth or \nimmigration and decreases due to emigration or death. \n\n \nAnalysis - The population is the only stock in this system. All of the inputs and \nexports are out of the system, which only means they are not being studied in \nthis model, not that they aren&#x27;t important. The population is a possible steady \nstate situation. Notice that this version of the model has left out the control of \nbirths or deaths by the population size itself. (See Figure 1 for how it should be \nwritten.) This diagram illustrates clearly that we need to understand the relative \nrates of all of these processes to predict what will happen with this population. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-8. Busier model of population change. Economic growth in a country \n(which can be the result of industrialization) creates wealth. The economic \nwealth per capita is the total economic wealth divided by the population at any \n\n\n\nDraft v7 141 \n\n \n\ntime. In models of population growth, a decrease in death rate is correlated to an \ninitial increase in per capita wealth. If the economic wealth per capita continues \nto increase, families may choose to have smaller families and thus decrease the \nbirth rate. Note that the structure of this model makes it clear that we are \nassuming that increased per capita wealth will have some impact on the birth \nand death rate. \n\n \nAnalysis: This model contains two simple models that are connected through the \n&quot;per capita wealth&quot; convertor. Economic growth will increase the per capita \nwealth and increases in population will decrease the per capita wealth. This \nmodel illustrates that if the economy grows more slowly than the population, it \nmay result in higher per capita wealth and then in a decreased birth rate. This \nmay lead to a slowing of the birth rate to allow a steady state population. \nHowever, if the economy grows just enough to decrease the death rate but the \nper capita wealth doesn&#x27;t increase after that point, the population will continue to \ngrow exponentially. This relationship between population and economic \nconditions is the basis for studying demographic transitions that occur. In \nNorthern Europe, the United States and Japan, for example, the industrialization \nand economic growth has lead to what is called the classical demographic \ntransition. We will revisit the systems description of demographic transitions \nwhen we study how different worldviews treat the risks of population growth \nand forecasts for economic growth (Chapter 11). The systems analysis of this \nproblem can be combined with other frameworks to provide further help in \ndescribing and making decisions. \n\n  \nExample 2: Global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere.  \n\nGlobal temperatures and the CO2 in the atmosphere are linked at \nmultiple layers. The &quot;busy&quot; model diagram below shows how \nseveral simple models are linked.  \n\n \n\n\n\n142 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n Figure 6-9. A busy model of atmospheric temperature and the geochemical \ncycle for carbon. The analysis, below, identifies the simple model parts and the \nlinkages between these sub-models. \n \nAnalysis: This model is missing many important stocks and flows. Even with \nthis deficit, it is useful to analyze the structure and potential behavior of the \nmodel.  \nThe top part of the model shows that the atmosphere could potentially be in \nsteady state for heat energy. The sun energy comes in and the heat is radiated \nback out. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere makes the net efficiency of \nirradiation back into space less efficient, requiring a slightly higher atmospheric \ntemperature to reach a steady state for the energy (heat) in the atmosphere. This \nis called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;. \nThe bottom part of the model shows two major fates for CO2 from the \natmosphere, either going into ocean or terrestrial biomass. In this version, the \n\n\n\nDraft v7 143 \n\n \n\nonly controls that are shown are the increase in respiration rates of the terrestrial \nand oceanic plants from higher temperature. Notice that the top part of the \nmodel is tracking energy and the bottom part of the model is tracking carbon. \nThere are no flows between these two halves, only an information connection \nand converter. The linkage of these two sub-models leads to a potentially very \nimportant behavior, run-away positive feedback of the temperature. The \nscenario for that outcome is as follows: \n\n1. the atmospheric temperature increases,  \n2. which increases respiration from terrestrial and aquatic biota,  \n3. which leads a higher steady state of CO2 in the atmosphere \n4. which, in turn, leads to higher temperature  \n5. and it continues \n\n \n\nThese two examples illustrate how the systems view is valuable. \nExample 1 shows how to take a simple model and combine it with \nanother simple model to study the potential interactions between \nprocesses. Example 2 shows how to dissect a model into the simple \nsub-models, analyze them and then put these all back together to \nstudy the overall behavior and look for potential problems. \n\n  \n6.5 Starting Steps  \n\n1. Identify what material or energy is being moved. \n2. Identify what the reservoirs are and how material or energy \n\nmoves between these reservoirs, i.e. the flows. \n3. Draw a boundary around the system you are studying: what \n\nstocks and flows are you quantifying and what is outside. If \nthere are flows in or out of your target system, then these \nmust be represented by sources or sinks, respectively. \n\n4. Create a diagram that shows the major reservoir stocks, \nflows, sources and sinks using the iconography supplied \nabove. \n\n5. Are there any conditions (such as temperature) or derived \nquantities (such as flow per person) that might be \ncontrolling a flow? If so, create a converter or constant to \nrepresent this relationship. \n\n6. Make linkages from stocks to flow-regulators, from one \nflow to another flow, and from convertors to flows. \n\n\n\n144 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n7. Check the diagram to see that all flows represent movement \nper unit time of whatever is in the stocks. \n\n8. Examine the diagram for the regulatory components within \na flow such as feedback inhibition (negative feedback), \nfeedback acceleration (positive feedback), stock-limited \nflow. \n\n9. Examine the diagram for relationships between the flow of \ndifferent material or energy (such as use of natural capital \nvs. the rate of population growth). \n\n  \n6.6 Overlaps and conflicts with other tools \n \n\nTerm in \n&quot;Systems&quot; \n\nother \nviewer/term \n\nsimilarities and \ndifferences \n\nboundary scale/extent Everything outside the \nboundary of the system is \neither neglected or is an \nunlimited source or sink. \nIn the Scale viewer, extent \nrelates to the size of the \nlargest dimension \nconsidered, the word \ndoesn&#x27;t imply any process \nor specific border. \n  \n\nstock network/node A stock must be \nsomething measurable that \ncan be moved through a \nflow. In the network view, \na node can be a quality \nthat changes depending on \ninput links. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 145 \n\n \n\n  \n\nflow network/link A flow must be the \nmovement of material or \nenergy per unit time and \nwhatever is flowing has to \nbe the same as the stock at \neither end. A link \nidentifies a relationship \nbetween nodes. It can be a \nquantity of material \nmoved but it doesn&#x27;t have \nto be a quantity. \n\n  \n\nstability network/stability, \nresilience and \nresistance \n\nSystems models can reach \nsteady state that has some \nstability due to some form \nof negative feedback that \nkeeps it at a level or in \nsome range. The type of \nsystems model that we are \nusing doesn&#x27;t have a \nmechanism to change its \nown structure. A network \ndiagram that has many \nweak interactions can shift \nthe operational structure \nand show how a large \nnumber of weak \ninteractions or the \ncombination of fast and \nslow processes can lead to \nthe resilience or loss of \nresilience of the network. \n\n\n\n146 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n6.7 Extending analysis to the next levels \nAn important extension of the use of systems models is to create \nsimulations that demonstrate overall system behavior given certain \ninput conditions and constants. We will look at the components of \nthe system, such as positive or negative feedback to look for very \ngeneral system behavior. There are software applications that are \nuseful for turning these systems diagrams into mathematical \ndynamic models (the diagrams and charts in this page were \ngenerated with STELLA from High Performance Systems, \nhttp://www.hps-inc.com). See the appendicies for this book to see \nsimulations that were written in STELLA and simulations made \navailable on the web (through Forio.com). In these simulations \nonly the parameter values can be changed, not the structure of the \nmodel itself. But these simulations are very useful for illustrating \nthe types of predictions and uses for simulations.  \n\nSimulations of this type are extremely useful in modern decision-\nmaking. For example, the Northwest Power Council created a \ncomplicated and very busy model that contained information on \nfish, dams, river flows and electricity. This model could be run \nunder different conditions and demands for energy to show which \nparameters affect fish survival most. They were able to show the \nmodel to people who work in this arena of fish and rivers to see if \nthe model behaves in a way they think it should; does it show low \nfish years when expected or high fish years following particular \nevents? The simulation model and the accessible interface were \npowerful tools in addressing problems and getting people to learn \nabout complicated social, economic and ecological issues. \n\n  \n\n\n\nDraft v7 147 \n\n \n\n6.8 Developing a simplified Systems model of \nsustainable resource use \nMany people subscribe to the idea that a sustainable resource is \none in which you reach a steady state because you don&#x27;t use the \nresource faster than it is being created. Whether or not this is \nrequired for all resources to attain a sustainable society is a very \ninteresting question. It maybe that you can have some resources \ndecrease and be replaced by other resources.  There are different \ndefinitions of overall sustainability that address whether the entire \nensemble of capital types has to be stable or whether substitutions \ncan be made.  \n\nWe will focus here on the sustainable use of a single resource. For \nexample, you would harvest the wood at the same rate as new trees \nwere growing to replace what you took. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-10. The starting assumptions for a model of sustainable natural \nresources are that input comes from growth and output goes to harvest. There \nare no other inputs or fates being considered.  \n\n \n\nIf this resource is based in natural  (biological) capital the growth \nrate will often depend on the amount of the stock. For example \nhealthy fish populations grow faster with more fish and trees will \ngrow better in a healthy forest with lots of other trees to provide \nprotection and a suitable micro-climate. Although it isn&#x27;t always \nthe case, let&#x27;s model the natural resource as having a positive \nrelationship to the growth of new resource.  \n\n\n\n148 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-11. In a simple sustainable harvest model, the natural resource has a \npositive feedback on the growth of that resource. This holds within the region of \nhealthy, and not over-abundant resource. \n\n \n\nWhen we harvest the resource, we might just be removing the fish \nor trees, but we can also be degrading the environment that the fish \nor trees need to grow. For example, driving bulldozers around on \nthe soil and channelizing streams in steep watersheds has a \nnegative effect on forest health. Similarly, some fishing methods \ndisrupt the breeding areas for fish. Thus the harvest has a direct \ntake of the resource but it can also degrade the conditions leading \nto a decrease in the growth rate. Notice in this case that a negative \neffect on conditions is passed through to impact growth because \nthere is a positive relationship between conditions and growth: \nworse conditions lead to lower growth. \n\n \n\n\n\nDraft v7 149 \n\n \n\n  \nFigure 6-12.  The mechanisms of harvest can have a negative effect on the \nconditions for growth. Overharvest can damage the microenvironment necessary \nfor optimal growth. \n\n \n\nAnother important issue with natural resource management is the \nimpact of bad (or good) luck. What if you were managing a forest \nthat had an average growth rate but there was a single drought year \nthat decreased the input to the resource by 50% just for that year? \nIf you had a harvest plan that was even just 5% more than the \nactual maximum yield you could harvest, it would lead to a \ndecrease in the population that would never recover (assuming you \ndon&#x27;t stop harvesting after you see the population start to crash). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 6-13. Conditions might also vary with time, such as a year of drought or \nunhealthy water. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nThe effect of one bad year (only 50% output) and an underestimate \nof true maximum yield by only 5%. In 100 years you&#x27;re down to \nless than 1/3 of your starting natural capital. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-14. With just one bad year, holding to the previous \u201cmaximum \nsustainable yield\u201d will eventually cause the collapse of this resource. \n\n \n\nUsing this simple model of natural capital and sustainability \nillustrates that there are at least three ways to destroy the \nsustainability of your natural capital \n\na. simple overharvest, but this may be because you didn&#x27;t \nhave good estimates for the maximum yield \nb. indirect effects from either harvest methods or use \nc. risk of being too close to the maximum yield, one bad \nyear and the resource declines dramatically \n\n \n6.9 Case Study: Population and Environment of \nEaster Island, Rapa Nui \n\n\n\nDraft v7 151 \n\n \n\n Easter Island (also known as Rapa Nui) is a small island in the \nmiddle of a very large ocean. The area of the island is only 166 \nkm^2 (64 mi^2) and it is 2250 km from the nearest other island \n(Pitcairn Island) and over 3700 km from South America, the \nnearest continent. You have undoubtedly heard something about \nthis fascinating island related to speculations on what caused the \npopulation to crash. In fact, you&#x27;ve probably heard more about this \nisland because of this failure to be sustainable than you&#x27;ve heard \nabout any of the myriad of other islands in the South Pacific.  \n\nAt one time in the history of this island, the society had fairly \nsophisticated culture and technology. The cultural history describes \na well-developed hierarchy with laws and written script. The \nevidence of the technology was their ability to move the large \nstone statues, which the island is most known for, for long \ndistances. They moved carved stone sculptures that weighed up to \n82 tons as far as six miles (10 km). The islanders cultivated a large \npart of the island with multiple crops. Estimates of the maximum \npopulation on the island ranged from 7,000 to as high as 20,000. \nAnd yet the population and civilization must have crashed. When \nEuropean boats first recorded their interaction with the island (in \nthe 1700s) the population was only several thousand, and these \npeople were leading a tough life in an impoverished and desolate \nenvironment. \n\nYou can see from just the outlines of this story why the island&#x27;s \nhistory has always been so intriguing. Now with our interest in \nsustainable systems, it is important to attempt an understanding. \nThere are parallels between their tiny island and our planet. Once \nthe environment started to decay and subsequent crash of \npopulation and society, these islanders had no place to go. \nSustainability isn&#x27;t just about maintaining a mere subsistence life \nstyle, it&#x27;s also about continuing to develop the culture and have a \nhealthy physical existence.  \n\nIn this case study, we are going to examine the population, \nagriculture and land use practices that were employed on Easter \nIsland from about 400 AD to about 1700 AD. We are going to \n\n\n\n152 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nanalyze the very gradual depletion of the natural capital on Easter \nIsland using a &quot;systems&quot; approach. \n\n \nReferences to studies of the fate of Easter Island  \n\nA more complete story can be found at the following sources: \n\u2022 Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island \n\u2022 Discover Magazine: Jared Diamond. \u201cEaster\u2019s end.\u201d Discover \n\nmagazine, August 1995. 16(8): 62-69.  \n\u2022 TED talks such as: \n\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jared_diamond_on_why_so\ncieties_collapse.html \n\n\u2022 http://blog.ted.com/2008/10/27/why_do_societies_collapse/ \n\u2022 Diamond, J. (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or \n\nsucceed. New York, Viking. \n\n  \nSalient features \n\nThe story of Easter Island has particular features that make it \namenable to examination with a systems approach. First, it is very \nsimilar to the systems model for sustainability that we developed in \nFigure 12 and 13; there are suggestions of growth, harvest, and bad \nluck. Second, at any time the processes seem to be close to being \nin balance; it is only by looking at the long term effect of these do \nwe see the impact of a slight over harvest or a previous year of bad \nluck. Third, the description contains some simple models that \ncould be tied together to get an integrated picture; there is \npopulation growth, harvest of trees, soil moisture, agriculture and \nfishing. These processes are related, but not directly. \n\n  \nApplying the systems tool \n\nWe are going to put separate small models together and to examine \nhow these individual processes counter or reinforce each other. \nThis is an oversimplified model in which will only consider three \nstocks: the number of people, palm trees, and rats. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 153 \n\n \n\nThe number of people is the balance between birth and death rates. \nAs there are more people, there will be more births, i.e. the \npopulation growth has a positive feedback component. The number \nof deaths may depend on many other factors including natural \ncauses, famine, and disease. A simple model diagram for this is \ngiven below. \n\n \n  \n \nFigure 6-15. Human population sub-model showing positive feedback for births \nbut a constant death rate. \n\n \n\nThe number of trees is also a balance between the number of palm \nnuts that germinate and grow, and the cutting down of the trees. \n\n \n  \nFigure 6-016. Palm tree sub-model also have positive feedback for growth and \nconstant loss. \n\n \n\nThe third strand in our model will be the rat population. People \nbrought rodents to the island. These rats play a key role in this \nproblem. People eat the rats and the rats eat the palm fruit, \ndecreasing the tree population. Their population is just like the \n\n\n\n154 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\nothers, there is positive feedback for rat births and several factors \ncontrolling death. \n\nNow we are going to connect these three stocks and flows models \nwith factors that affect either the birth or death rates. The following \nlist details these interactions. \n\n1. Rats have a positive effect on people births because this \nis a source of food for people. The birth rate of people will \nincrease with more rats (and the birth rate will decrease if \nrats are low). \n\n2. Rats have a negative effect on human death. The death \nrate of people will increase if rats are too low. \n\n3. People have a positive effect on the harvesting of trees. \nMore people cut down more trees because they need them \nfor fishing and to cultivate land for crops. \n\n4. Rats have a negative effect on the rate of palm fruit \ngermination. The number of rats decreases the percentage \nof new palm seeds that germinate successfully because the \nrats chew on the seeds. \n\n5. Palm trees have a positive effect on rat births, because \nthe rats eat the palm fruit. \n\n  \n\nWe could add more detail to this model, but even with only these \nfive interactions this turns out to be a very interesting and \ninstructive model. Looking at the model diagram, below, you can \nsee that there are many positive feedbacks and only a few negative \nfeedbacks. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6-17. The rat submodel interacts with both humans and trees. \n\n \nAccording to the historical record, as the human population grew, \npeople cut more and more trees. They needed these trees for \nmaking boats for fishing and they needed more and more land for \ncultivation. Over harvesting trees, just on its own would have been \na problem for them, but this was exacerbated by the fact that they \nalso ate rats, and rats depended on the trees for food. As the human \npopulation continued to grow, they cut enough trees such that they \nran out of trees to use for fishing. Simultaneously, with fewer trees \nthey not only couldn&#x27;t fish effectively but the other food source, \nrats, declined. \n\nThe model built here only represents a few of the interactions that \nhave been described. By putting these into a systems diagram, we \ncan explore the possible behaviors of the individual populations \nand their effect on each other.  It is possible that the population \n\n\n\n156 August 13, 2013 \n\n \n\ncould have also reached a balance. There is nothing inherent in the \nstructure of these relationships that makes it crash.  However, the \nbalance comes about because all of the relatively rapid rates of all \nthe processes are cancelling each other out, but a minor imbalance \nin the rates can lead to abrupt changes in the whole system. \n\nSome narratives of Easter Island decline blame the population for \ntheir resource use strategies. For example in the book \u201cCollapse\u201d \n(2005), Jared Diamond wonders what the person who cut down the \nlast palm tree was thinking. Even this simple model shows that \nthere were multiple factors in play and the path toward a \ndownward spiral of trees could have been set in motion when there \nwere still many trees. This should be a cautionary tale for working \nwith real and complex systems, i.e. the controls may have delays \nand multiple factors that make them very difficult for a person in \nthe ecosystem and society to observe.  It\u2019s not just a matter of \ntaking the right action for the moment, but also being able to \nunderstand the more complex interactions and consequences of our \nactions. \n \n6.10 Summary \nMethodically constructing a stock and flow model to represent the \nprocesses related to an environmental problem supports good \npractice for scientific information gathering.  The constraints on \nthe quantities that are being measured and followed forces the \nclarification of assumptions. The structure of the model can be \nvisualized with iconography that illuminates the relationship to \nparticular functions of the overall system such as feedbacks, stock \nlimitation and possible steady state conditions. The basic \nassumptions for using a natural resource sustainably can be \nexplored using this approach. The goal of sustainable use would be \nto have the input match the output and maintain a steady state for \nthe resource. Positive feedback works to replenish the stock, but \nthis is a double-edged sword, just one bad year can lead to an \neventual collapse unless the harvest is decreased. \n\n\n\nDraft v7 157 \n\n \n\nAnalysis of these models involves taking apart each stock and flow \nand explaining how that part contributes to the overall behavior of \nthe system. This is a very useful exercise for construction of the \nmodel and for communication about the important features of a \nproblem. \n\nAs models become busier they often require sub-models for \ndifferent stocks. The example of Easter Island demonstrated \nhypothetical relationships between the stocks of palm trees, people \nand rats. At high human populations, this system was not resilient \nto changes and might explain the decline of the resource base. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n", "title": "v7-Rueter-chap6.pdf", "tether_id":

Become Part of Secondary School Math Instruction\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QBrmAGcMIi8\n\n00:00:00.719 hello my name is diana fisher\n00:00:03.040 i have been asked to present to on the\n00:00:05.839 system dynamics work\n00:00:07.200 i have done with secondary school\n00:00:08.880 students and teachers over three decades\n00:00:11.599 i have used system dynamics modeling in\n00:00:13.920 my mathematics and modeling instruction\n00:00:16.000 for 30 years\n00:00:17.520 although science instruction is the most\n00:00:19.680 natural discipline for sd modeling i\n00:00:22.080 would like to make\n00:00:23.199 an argument that if we really want sd\n00:00:25.840 modeling to become\n00:00:26.960 a more mainstream analytical tool it\n00:00:30.240 should be embedded in secondary school\n00:00:32.640 mathematics\n00:00:33.840 sd modeling can reinforce important\n00:00:37.120 mathematical concepts quite well dr\n00:00:40.320 barry m specializes in the study of\n00:00:42.399 complex systems\n00:00:43.760 to be able to analyze complex systems\n00:00:46.879 he claims that calculus and statistics\n00:00:49.120 do not have the tools to describe\n00:00:51.680 what we want to study that we need\n00:00:55.360 to work with new concepts that we need\n00:00:58.960 to\n00:00:59.359 ask different questions about system\n00:01:02.000 dynamic behavior\n00:01:03.920 he says working with complex systems\n00:01:06.799 changes how we think\n00:01:08.560 we have an opportunity to help our\n00:01:10.479 mathematics students broaden their\n00:01:12.400 thinking\n00:01:13.280 to encompass techniques that will help\n00:01:15.520 them think about\n00:01:16.479 complex dynamic problems one way to\n00:01:19.600 start\n00:01:20.240 is improving their understanding of\n00:01:22.080 functions studies in the united states\n00:01:25.200 indicate that students possess weak\n00:01:27.280 understanding of functions\n00:01:29.280 over the last several decades\n00:01:32.960 mathematics instruction in the u.s\n00:01:35.520 evolved to require\n00:01:37.040 multiple representation of function\n00:01:39.439 behavior\n00:01:40.320 including graphs and tables but now\n00:01:42.640 research indicates that mapping diagrams\n00:01:45.280 also provide a rich foundation for\n00:01:48.240 understanding functions\n00:01:50.799 the late dr james kapit proposed\n00:01:54.520 democratizing the comp concepts of\n00:01:57.280 calculus\n00:01:58.399 by providing technology-based learning\n00:02:01.280 environments\n00:02:02.479 he said new notation systems with new\n00:02:05.680 ways of\n00:02:06.479 acting upon those new notation systems\n00:02:09.840 offer dramatically new possibilities for\n00:02:12.480 mathematics learning\n00:02:14.319 sd is such a new and powerful\n00:02:18.080 notation system the audience recognizes\n00:02:21.120 these system dynamics modeling icons\n00:02:23.440 from which sd models can be constructed\n00:02:26.400 the stock\n00:02:27.280 and accumulator represents a main\n00:02:29.599 function in the model\n00:02:31.200 mathematically it operates as an\n00:02:33.519 integral does in calculus the flow\n00:02:36.800 is the rate of change of the stock so it\n00:02:39.200 is essentially the first derivative\n00:02:41.120 described in calculus\n00:02:43.280 converters hold constants parameters or\n00:02:46.080 simple\n00:02:46.560 or arithmetic combinations of model\n00:02:49.040 components\n00:02:50.319 the connector indicates the influence of\n00:02:52.959 one\n00:02:53.360 model component on another\n00:02:55.400 mathematically\n00:02:56.800 the connectors identify the dependencies\n00:02:59.599 of one variable\n00:03:00.879 variable on another i will not take you\n00:03:04.319 quickly through the two\n00:03:05.599 most basic functions studied in algebra\n00:03:08.800 connecting sd and traditional\n00:03:10.720 mathematics\n00:03:11.840 representation suppose we were\n00:03:14.080 interested in how\n00:03:15.040 water in a lake is increasing based on\n00:03:17.440 water flowing in\n00:03:18.560 at a constant rate using the sd\n00:03:21.760 structure the initial\n00:03:25.280 water in the lake would be placed in a\n00:03:27.840 stock icon\n00:03:29.200 and it would only have an\n00:03:32.239 inflow since it is only increasing\n00:03:35.599 with a constant value in the flow we\n00:03:38.799 know the behavior of the stock\n00:03:40.640 is growing linearly since the rate of\n00:03:42.799 change is constant\n00:03:44.319 and positive the sd\n00:03:47.360 software calculates the value of the\n00:03:49.360 stock using recursion which is shown in\n00:03:52.000 the table at the left\n00:03:53.599 we see that the flow value is added to\n00:03:56.239 the current value of the stock\n00:03:58.080 each time unit now we see the\n00:04:00.640 traditional closed form equation for the\n00:04:02.720 linear function where w\n00:04:04.560 represents the amount of water in the\n00:04:07.439 lake\n00:04:08.400 it starts at 100 units and grows at five\n00:04:11.439 units per year\n00:04:13.040 if we were to construct what we know is\n00:04:16.000 an exponential population growth\n00:04:18.320 behavior\n00:04:19.358 we could start with a stock of elephants\n00:04:21.680 and an inflow of new elephants\n00:04:23.600 born to this herd each year but this\n00:04:26.479 model is not correct\n00:04:28.320 we know the inflow cannot be constant\n00:04:30.880 because the number of new elephants born\n00:04:32.960 per year depends on knowing how many\n00:04:34.960 elephants are currently\n00:04:36.400 in the herd so we now indicate that\n00:04:39.680 dependency with a connector\n00:04:42.560 oh and now we have introduced a feedback\n00:04:45.680 loop\n00:04:46.400 the loop is reinforcing because the more\n00:04:49.280 elephants in the population\n00:04:51.280 the more new elephants are born per year\n00:04:54.080 adding more elephants to the herd\n00:04:56.639 but this model is still not complete we\n00:04:59.759 should\n00:05:00.320 indicate the number of new elephants\n00:05:02.479 born per\n00:05:03.759 elephant in the herd each year\n00:05:06.880 we do that by indicating a birth\n00:05:09.600 fraction\n00:05:10.240 in decimal form that will be multiplied\n00:05:13.199 by the number of elements\n00:05:14.639 in the herd each year so for exponential\n00:05:17.919 growth the inflow is proportional to the\n00:05:20.479 current amount of the stock\n00:05:22.880 or mathematically the rate of change the\n00:05:25.759 flow\n00:05:26.560 is defined as the stock value times some\n00:05:29.840 growth factor value this is exactly the\n00:05:33.199 differential equation\n00:05:34.880 that represents exponential growth but\n00:05:37.039 algebra students\n00:05:38.000 don&#x27;t need to know that they are\n00:05:39.759 learning calculus\n00:05:41.280 they are just learning a different\n00:05:42.880 behavior pattern over time\n00:05:44.960 and how to create it based on its rate\n00:05:47.520 of change definition\n00:05:49.840 again quickly we would have our stock\n00:05:52.479 flow definition as shown\n00:05:54.160 with a 20 growth fraction the elephant\n00:05:57.440 population will grow\n00:05:58.800 exponentially because the inflow is\n00:06:01.039 proportional to the stock value\n00:06:03.360 if we think about what the sd software\n00:06:05.680 is doing\n00:06:06.560 we look at the recursion in the table\n00:06:09.280 the flow\n00:06:10.240 calculates the growth amount and adds it\n00:06:13.360 to the stock\n00:06:14.639 each year there are two equations that\n00:06:17.919 are possible\n00:06:18.960 mathematically the easier equation is\n00:06:21.840 represented at the top\n00:06:23.520 and is the one often taught in first\n00:06:26.080 year algebra\n00:06:27.280 it is often used when we want to\n00:06:29.440 calculate values\n00:06:30.720 once every year or time unit\n00:06:33.759 the second is shown at the bottom and is\n00:06:37.280 often used in situations where\n00:06:40.000 calculating continuous change\n00:06:41.919 is a better choice the top equation is\n00:06:44.720 probably the best choice for this\n00:06:46.479 particular elephant heard example\n00:06:49.120 in sd modeling we use the same diagram\n00:06:52.240 for each scenario and merely increase\n00:06:54.800 the number of times the simulation\n00:06:56.960 calculates the values each time\n00:06:59.120 unit to differentiate which\n00:07:02.400 situation is being used for calculation\n00:07:05.599 as a it is a much more intuitive process\n00:07:09.360 in my opinion just so you know\n00:07:13.120 there is a free web-based version of the\n00:07:15.360 sd modeling software that works on\n00:07:17.680 tablets computers laptops chromebooks\n00:07:20.080 and smartphone\n00:07:21.440 that will allow you to have your\n00:07:23.759 students build these models\n00:07:25.759 if they have access to this technology\n00:07:28.639 go to publish.icsysystems.com\n00:07:31.840 the software is called stella online\n00:07:36.160 once students learn linear and\n00:07:38.479 exponential model structures they can\n00:07:40.560 start putting them together to study new\n00:07:42.720 problems\n00:07:43.680 they could not study with equations\n00:07:46.720 i have used these medication models in\n00:07:49.199 my algebra classes over\n00:07:51.199 many years students really like them\n00:07:54.639 consider an emergency room problem you\n00:07:57.759 the student are a medical resident\n00:08:00.240 working in the emergency room\n00:08:02.160 and a patient comes in who needs\n00:08:04.000 immediate medical tension\n00:08:06.160 from your analysis you decide to connect\n00:08:08.560 this patient to an iv drip that will\n00:08:10.800 supply\n00:08:11.440 one milligram of therapeutic drug per\n00:08:14.560 minute\n00:08:15.199 this person you estimate will metabolize\n00:08:17.680 the drug\n00:08:18.639 at about 0.55 percent per minute\n00:08:22.639 what is the pattern of the drug level in\n00:08:24.879 the body over 24 hours\n00:08:27.599 so the diagram might look like this with\n00:08:30.000 an inflow of medicine and an\n00:08:31.680 outflow of body using and\n00:08:34.799 eliminating the medicine observe the\n00:08:37.679 left\n00:08:38.000 side of the diagram since there is a\n00:08:40.000 constant inflow the left part of the\n00:08:41.839 diagram is similar to\n00:08:43.599 a linear model structure observe the\n00:08:47.120 right part of the diagram\n00:08:48.640 the structure is similar to an\n00:08:50.399 exponential decay\n00:08:51.760 the drug is lost as a percent of the\n00:08:54.399 current amount of drug in the patient&#x27;s\n00:08:56.320 systems\n00:08:57.839 students try to predict the behavior of\n00:09:00.080 the drug\n00:09:00.959 in the body over time giving a reason\n00:09:03.440 for their predictions\n00:09:05.040 then they build the model and see what\n00:09:07.360 the computer produces\n00:09:09.360 then they have to explain why the\n00:09:12.080 computer graph\n00:09:13.200 has the shape that it shows\n00:09:16.800 skipping to the skipping the second\n00:09:18.800 medication scenario we will go to the\n00:09:21.200 third drug model\n00:09:22.959 it involves taking medicine in the form\n00:09:25.120 of pills\n00:09:26.640 it has been a busy day in the emergency\n00:09:29.200 room a third\n00:09:30.160 patient arrives and you decide to give\n00:09:32.320 this patient two\n00:09:33.519 pills of 375 milligrams\n00:09:36.959 each of a therapeutic drug and tell them\n00:09:39.680 to continue taking\n00:09:41.360 two more pills every four hours this\n00:09:44.399 person you\n00:09:45.200 estimate will absorb the drug from the\n00:09:47.760 stomach in the bloodstream\n00:09:50.080 at about 4.5\n00:09:53.360 percent per minute and metabolize the\n00:09:56.399 drug\n00:09:57.120 at about point 55 percent per minute\n00:10:00.560 what is the pattern of drug level in the\n00:10:02.640 body over 24 hours\n00:10:05.120 this model uses two stalks because the\n00:10:07.519 medicine\n00:10:08.640 must first accumulate in the stomach and\n00:10:10.880 then move into the bloodstream\n00:10:12.959 the inflow is a pulse because the pills\n00:10:15.839 are taken\n00:10:16.480 once every four hours students are asked\n00:10:19.839 to anticipate the pattern of behavior of\n00:10:22.240 the left\n00:10:23.040 of just the left part of the model drug\n00:10:26.160 in the stomach then students are asked\n00:10:28.800 to anticipate the pattern of drug in the\n00:10:31.120 blood over time\n00:10:32.640 this is not a trivial analysis then\n00:10:35.600 different patterns of pill delivery\n00:10:37.360 protocol\n00:10:38.160 are explored and compared to the optimal\n00:10:41.120 therapeutic level for this\n00:10:42.800 medication finally in this sequence of\n00:10:45.600 medication models\n00:10:47.040 students as a class are asked to help\n00:10:49.760 modify\n00:10:50.959 the pill model so that it will\n00:10:54.399 calculate the blood alcohol\n00:10:56.480 concentration\n00:10:57.760 of a human male sipping beer over two\n00:11:00.720 hours\n00:11:01.839 the modified stock flow diagram is\n00:11:04.560 sketched as a class\n00:11:06.240 then students access the pre-built model\n00:11:09.760 online and test the following scenarios\n00:11:12.560 using the model\n00:11:15.040 influence of body weight gender type of\n00:11:17.760 alcohol and type of drinker\n00:11:20.560 now let&#x27;s turn to a different sequence\n00:11:22.880 of models\n00:11:23.760 the basic population model is ubiquitous\n00:11:26.480 in system dynamics studies\n00:11:28.720 problems in health economics\n00:11:30.720 environmental science biology geography\n00:11:33.360 sociology and mathematics and more often\n00:11:36.720 involve the study of population dynamics\n00:11:39.839 the basic population model involves a\n00:11:42.880 stock for population\n00:11:44.720 since that&#x27;s the value that we want to\n00:11:46.480 track over time\n00:11:47.760 it is the function an outflow of births\n00:11:51.200 and an inflow of births and an outflow\n00:11:54.399 of deaths\n00:11:55.040 and their attendant births and deaths\n00:11:57.440 fraction\n00:11:58.800 the basic model contains two feedback\n00:12:01.120 loops that control\n00:12:02.480 change in population dynamics over time\n00:12:06.480 there are three types of graphs that\n00:12:08.959 this structure could\n00:12:10.000 produce based upon which feedback is\n00:12:12.959 dominant\n00:12:14.160 assume that the birth fraction is larger\n00:12:16.160 than the death fraction\n00:12:17.360 the model could produce exponential\n00:12:19.360 growth but the deer population cannot\n00:12:21.839 grow forever\n00:12:22.720 there are limiting factors that would\n00:12:24.480 influence the growth\n00:12:26.000 as the deer population increases there\n00:12:28.320 would be more competition for food and\n00:12:30.240 water\n00:12:31.200 deer could become more aggressive as\n00:12:33.279 they vie for\n00:12:34.320 the limited resource overcrowding can\n00:12:37.360 also lead to aggression\n00:12:39.120 and to the spread of disease as waste\n00:12:41.760 builds up in a limited area\n00:12:43.760 each of these factors would lead to a\n00:12:46.079 higher death rate for the deer\n00:12:48.320 assume that the environment can support\n00:12:51.360 only a specific number of deer the\n00:12:54.399 number of deer the environment can\n00:12:56.639 support in any given location is called\n00:13:00.079 the carrying capacity we assume that the\n00:13:03.200 comparison\n00:13:03.920 comparison the carrying capacity value\n00:13:07.279 is unchanging\n00:13:09.040 as the population grows toward the\n00:13:12.480 carrying capacity\n00:13:14.320 the death fraction is being increased\n00:13:18.079 as we think it should the deer\n00:13:21.120 population graph looks reasonable with\n00:13:23.360 the carrying capacity component\n00:13:25.440 at the beginning there are few deer\n00:13:28.480 and the population is growing quite a\n00:13:30.560 bit as the population gets closer to the\n00:13:33.200 carrying capacity the growth slows down\n00:13:35.760 eventually\n00:13:36.639 moving to steady state this demonstrates\n00:13:40.800 transfer of feedback loop dominance\n00:13:44.240 now look at the typical closed form\n00:13:46.399 equation for the same scenario\n00:13:48.800 it seems to me that the stock flow model\n00:13:51.519 is easier to understand and\n00:13:53.279 interpret making this scenario\n00:13:55.440 approachable by students in mathematics\n00:13:57.839 classes\n00:13:58.399 lower than precalculus where the\n00:14:00.639 equation is usually studied\n00:14:02.800 i have used this model in my algebra\n00:14:05.040 classes successfully\n00:14:06.560 with students as young as 15.\n00:14:10.480 so now we get to the meat of this\n00:14:12.880 presentation\n00:14:14.399 what overarching value does sd modeling\n00:14:17.760 approach\n00:14:18.399 add to mathematics instruction a new\n00:14:21.279 representation for some core functions\n00:14:23.839 studied in algebra and precalculus\n00:14:26.480 provides not only a different\n00:14:27.920 representation that is more visual\n00:14:30.480 for the functions but bases the new\n00:14:32.800 representation\n00:14:34.160 on the rates of change for each function\n00:14:37.199 a very important concept in calculus\n00:14:40.399 the structure the blueprint for each\n00:14:42.800 function helps describe\n00:14:44.480 why the function behavior makes sense\n00:14:47.360 that is\n00:14:48.240 constant flows create linear stock\n00:14:51.199 behavior\n00:14:52.399 proportional fro flows create\n00:14:54.800 exponential stock behavior\n00:14:56.639 etc each system dynamics icon\n00:15:00.079 uses full words or phrases in their\n00:15:03.040 names\n00:15:03.519 making it easier to remember what each\n00:15:05.920 part of the model represents\n00:15:08.000 and it has been my experience with\n00:15:10.320 students\n00:15:11.120 that they have a much easier time\n00:15:13.440 translating word problems that describe\n00:15:15.920 dynamics to the sd model structure\n00:15:20.160 take for example the representation for\n00:15:22.399 an oscillating spring behavior\n00:15:24.639 the stock flow diagram captures the\n00:15:27.360 concepts of position\n00:15:28.959 restoring force mass acceleration\n00:15:31.360 velocity etc\n00:15:33.040 all central concepts in the dynamic of a\n00:15:35.680 bouncing spring\n00:15:37.199 the closed form equation merely\n00:15:40.720 captures the appearance of the\n00:15:42.800 oscillation\n00:15:44.320 not the core structure that is causing\n00:15:46.800 the behavior to occur\n00:15:48.800 i believe that the stock flow structure\n00:15:50.880 is more educationally\n00:15:52.560 valuable than the closed form equation\n00:15:56.320 students and many adults are notoriously\n00:15:59.199 poor\n00:15:59.680 at reading and interpreting graphs sd\n00:16:02.800 modeling\n00:16:03.600 has one of its main analytical\n00:16:06.160 techniques\n00:16:07.199 to interpret the graphical output of the\n00:16:09.600 models\n00:16:10.560 multiple times as models are built\n00:16:13.279 modified\n00:16:14.079 and tested students get lots of practice\n00:16:17.839 reading and interpreting graphs moreover\n00:16:21.040 students are often required to view flow\n00:16:23.759 graphs\n00:16:24.399 on the same grid as stock graphs to help\n00:16:27.839 explain stock behavior this\n00:16:30.399 correlational\n00:16:31.360 graphical analysis is a core concept in\n00:16:34.639 calculus\n00:16:35.360 and very important for understanding\n00:16:37.600 dynamic phenomenon\n00:16:39.839 creating the stop flow diagram lays\n00:16:43.040 bare the student&#x27;s mental model the\n00:16:46.160 student can\n00:16:46.959 test his or her mental model to\n00:16:49.279 determine\n00:16:50.320 if the structure produces reasonable\n00:16:52.560 results\n00:16:53.600 then if it does not the student knows he\n00:16:56.000 or she must\n00:16:57.040 modify the model structure via more\n00:16:59.839 research that often includes\n00:17:01.680 communicating with other team members\n00:17:04.319 to improve the model and obtain\n00:17:06.720 reasonable results\n00:17:08.640 as you have seen building useful and\n00:17:11.199 interesting models\n00:17:12.720 using sd modeling can allow students to\n00:17:16.319 build\n00:17:16.720 problems that would be out of their\n00:17:18.559 reach using only closed form equations\n00:17:21.839 this makes a much larger pool of\n00:17:24.880 interesting problems for students to\n00:17:26.799 study\n00:17:27.599 and makes connecting mathematics with\n00:17:30.320 real\n00:17:30.840 world more obvious\n00:17:33.840 another factor that is outside current\n00:17:36.320 mathematics instruction at the secondary\n00:17:38.320 school level\n00:17:39.039 is the importance of non-linear system\n00:17:41.919 behavior\n00:17:42.720 which is necessary to produce transfer\n00:17:45.440 of feedback loop dominance\n00:17:48.160 and of course the inclusion of delays\n00:17:50.880 the model\n00:17:51.679 on the left has been built and analyzed\n00:17:54.400 by\n00:17:55.000 non-honors algebra students and the\n00:17:58.000 delays\n00:17:58.880 represented on the right both material\n00:18:01.360 at the top\n00:18:02.080 and information delays at the bottom\n00:18:05.039 could be understood by algebra students\n00:18:08.799 this slide identifies two websites\n00:18:12.080 with resources that you may find useful\n00:18:15.520 the first is a website that contains\n00:18:17.679 some free\n00:18:18.960 sd lessons for use with secondary school\n00:18:21.600 students\n00:18:22.480 as well as where to purchase some books\n00:18:25.039 of sd lessons that are published\n00:18:27.760 it also contains examples of secondary\n00:18:30.080 school students\n00:18:31.039 original sd model diagrams and technical\n00:18:33.919 papers\n00:18:34.480 explaining the models it advertises\n00:18:37.600 online sd courses geared to secondary\n00:18:40.640 school math and science\n00:18:42.000 teachers and shows the alignment of sd\n00:18:45.120 with u.s national educational standards\n00:18:47.600 in many disciplines\n00:18:49.440 the other website contains additional\n00:18:52.640 lessons that can be downloaded or\n00:18:54.640 purchased\n00:18:55.440 and numerous lesson books appropriate\n00:18:58.320 for\n00:18:58.640 pre-college students the experience that\n00:19:02.240 greatly enhanced my opinion about the\n00:19:04.799 virtues of using the system dynamics\n00:19:07.039 modeling approach with students\n00:19:08.960 occurred when i saw what students could\n00:19:11.120 produce\n00:19:12.000 when given the freedom to choose a\n00:19:14.160 dynamic problem that\n00:19:15.520 interested them for which they could\n00:19:17.600 create an original model\n00:19:19.520 write a technical paper explaining their\n00:19:21.760 model and present their model\n00:19:24.400 to an audience\n00:19:27.600 i wanted to prepare students to identify\n00:19:31.280 and analyze\n00:19:32.240 problems in the world from which\n00:19:35.600 they could gain an understanding by\n00:19:37.760 building system dynamics models\n00:19:40.320 i wanted them to develop skill in model\n00:19:43.039 building\n00:19:43.760 in analyzing model design in output and\n00:19:47.120 feedback\n00:19:47.760 and in explaining what they learned so i\n00:19:50.480 designed a secondary school\n00:19:52.640 system dynamics modeling course that i\n00:19:54.799 taught for 20 years\n00:19:56.640 one of the most important lessons i\n00:19:58.640 included in my sd modeling course was to\n00:20:01.120 show students how to translate\n00:20:03.440 a systems problem found in a news\n00:20:05.919 article\n00:20:06.559 into a stock flow diagram students\n00:20:09.360 listed the most important variables\n00:20:11.520 they built the structure of their model\n00:20:13.280 by hand and they also sketched out the\n00:20:15.440 feedback\n00:20:16.159 students indicated that this was one of\n00:20:18.080 the most important lessons in preparing\n00:20:20.640 them to do their final project\n00:20:22.880 i&#x27;m going to magnify this bottom part\n00:20:26.000 so you can see it a little bit better\n00:20:29.760 i know it&#x27;s blurry but it&#x27;s because i\n00:20:32.480 just used the previous picture to\n00:20:34.159 magnify it\n00:20:35.280 but you can see the design of their\n00:20:37.280 model structure you can see their\n00:20:38.960 feedback loop\n00:20:40.159 they&#x27;re doing behavior over time graphs\n00:20:42.320 all of this was part of the lesson\n00:20:44.320 for analyzing an article in the news i&#x27;m\n00:20:47.200 now going to show you\n00:20:48.559 some sample student original sd models\n00:20:52.000 in 2007 when the united states was\n00:20:54.720 experiencing an oil crisis\n00:20:57.200 this student observed that many people\n00:20:59.120 were trying unsuccessfully to buy hybrid\n00:21:02.080 cars this was his idea of why\n00:21:05.760 the problem happened it actually is\n00:21:08.000 broken into three segments\n00:21:10.559 there is the hybrid car segment at the\n00:21:13.440 top\n00:21:14.400 i&#x27;ll go back hybrid car production\n00:21:18.880 hybrid inventory and active\n00:21:21.919 hybrid in vehicles\n00:21:25.360 there is a factory capacity which was a\n00:21:28.799 limiting factor on being able to produce\n00:21:31.200 enough cars\n00:21:32.400 and then there was a backlog of orders\n00:21:35.039 and perceived backlogged\n00:21:37.039 that prospective buyers weren&#x27;t going to\n00:21:39.919 get\n00:21:40.559 a car very soon even if they ordered one\n00:21:44.000 his model did not start an equilibrium\n00:21:46.400 unfortunately\n00:21:47.679 so let&#x27;s ignore the first part of the\n00:21:49.440 graph and and focus on the spike in oil\n00:21:52.640 prices\n00:21:53.520 at week 30. the new demand which is the\n00:21:56.720 pink\n00:21:57.440 curve spikes upward for hybrid cars\n00:22:01.760 that is quickly followed by a spike in\n00:22:04.159 the backlog demand for hybrid cars which\n00:22:06.640 is the brown graph\n00:22:08.400 the price of hybrid cars which is the\n00:22:10.880 green curve shows an\n00:22:12.480 increase as backlog increases the blue\n00:22:15.520 line\n00:22:16.080 which is on a scale by itself is the\n00:22:18.480 number of active hybrid cars\n00:22:20.720 and that is steadily increasing\n00:22:24.000 the first year i introduced material and\n00:22:26.400 information delays to my students\n00:22:28.559 many students understood the ideas\n00:22:30.559 immediately\n00:22:32.080 this student started his model on\n00:22:34.320 workforce pressure\n00:22:35.840 using the idea of three delays so\n00:22:38.960 here we have employees\n00:22:42.080 who are being hired and fired this is\n00:22:45.120 the amount of\n00:22:46.159 work that the company wants done\n00:22:50.080 this is the perceived satisfaction of\n00:22:53.200 the current working people\n00:22:55.120 and up here is the pay that is given\n00:22:58.960 to the workers the three\n00:23:02.320 delays here are an information delay\n00:23:06.000 down in the perceived satisfaction\n00:23:09.280 and information delay in hiring and\nThe

Mineral Water (Stock-Limited Resource)\n\nItalian bottled mineral water, a quintessential stock-limited resource, exemplifies the delicate balance required in managing finite natural resources. The stock in this scenario is the volume of accessible mineral water contained within natural aquifers. The **inputs** to this stock are primarily the natural processes of water cycle, including infiltration and underground flow rates, which are generally slow and limited by geological and climatic conditions. **Outputs** consist of bottled water extraction for commercial use. \n\n**Feedback loops** in this system can include regulatory policies affecting extraction rates and market demands influencing production intensity. For instance, a decrease in water levels might lead to stricter regulations reducing extraction rates, which could in turn affect the availability and price of bottled water on the market.\n\n### Systems Dynamics of Olive Oil Production (Flow-Limited Resource)\n\nOlive oil production, on the other hand, illustrates a flow-limited resource where the dynamics are centered around the agricultural cycle of olive trees. The **stock** here is the amount of olive oil produced and stored for distribution. **Inputs** include the harvest of olives, which is seasonal and can vary significantly from year to year based on factors like weather conditions and agricultural practices. The **outputs** are the sale and consumption of the olive oil.\n\n**Feedback loops** might involve the relationship between market demand and production adjustments. High demand can incentivize farmers to increase the area under cultivation or invest in more efficient extraction and processing technologies, thereby potentially increasing output.\n\nBoth examples demonstrate the intricate interplay of natural processes, human activity, and regulatory frameworks in resource management. Sustainable practices in both cases hinge on understanding these dynamics and implementing policies that align with long-term resource availability and ecosystem health.\n\n### References:\n- &quot;Chapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems&quot;, *v7-Rueter*, 2013\n- Diana Fisher&#x27;s insights on system dynamics, *YouTube Video Transcript*, tactiq.io\n\nThese sources emphasize the importance of modeling and managing resources through a systems dynamics approach, where feedback loops, stock limitations, and flow rates are crucial to understanding and sustaining resource availability."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The stock in this model\u2014the accessible volume of mineral water\u2014has inputs limited by the natural recharge rates of aquifers, primarily influenced by geological and climatic conditions. The **outputs** are the extraction rates driven by bottled water companies. \n\nFeedback mechanisms here are deeply intertwined with capitalist incentives. For instance, the demand for higher profits can lead to over-extraction, risking the depletion of the resource. Regulatory responses to manage and mitigate these risks, such as limiting extraction rates, are often at odds with business interests, which prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. The potential decrease in water levels could trigger stricter regulations, affecting the availability and market price of bottled water, demonstrating a classic conflict between environmental sustainability and profit-driven objectives.\n\n### Systems Dynamics of Olive Oil Production (Flow-Limited Resource)\n\nSimilarly, olive oil production showcases the flow-limited resource dynamics within a capitalist framework. The stock here\u2014olive oil\u2014is subject to inputs like olive harvests, which vary annually based on agricultural conditions influenced by both natural factors and human interventions such as fertilization and irrigation practices, aimed at maximizing output. The outputs involve the processing, sale, and consumption of olive oil.\n\nMarket-driven feedback loops can exacerbate the strain on resources. High demand can lead to intensified farming practices, potentially degrading soil quality and reducing biodiversity, which are crucial for long-term agricultural health. The capitalist drive for profit maximizes immediate outputs at the expense of long-term resource sustainability, pushing the boundaries of natural production cycles and ecological balance.\n\nIn both scenarios, the capitalist emphasis on maximizing profit can severely strain the sustainability of natural resources. These dynamics demonstrate the critical need for systems thinking in regulatory and management strategies to balance economic interests with ecological and resource sustainability.\n\n### References:\n- &quot;Chapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems&quot;, *v7-Rueter*, 2013\n- Diana Fisher&#x27;s insights on system dynamics, *YouTube Video Transcript*, tactiq.io\n\nThis analysis underscores the tension between capitalist motivations and sustainable resource management, highlighting how short-term profit goals often undermine the necessary long-term stewardship of natural resources."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The stock in this scenario is the volume of accessible mineral water contained within natural aquifers. The **inputs** to this stock are primarily the natural processes of water cycle, including infiltration and underground flow rates, which are generally slow and limited by geological and climatic conditions. **Outputs** consist of bottled water extraction for commercial use. \n\n**Feedback loops** in this system can include regulatory policies affecting extraction rates and market demands influencing production intensity. For instance, a decrease in water levels might lead to stricter regulations reducing extraction rates, which could in turn affect the availability and price of bottled water on the market.\n\n### Systems Dynamics of Olive Oil Production (Flow-Limited Resource)\n\nOlive oil production, on the other hand, illustrates a flow-limited resource where the dynamics are centered around the agricultural cycle of olive trees. The **stock** here is the amount of olive oil produced and stored for distribution. **Inputs** include the harvest of olives, which is seasonal and can vary significantly from year to year based on factors like weather conditions and agricultural practices. The **outputs** are the sale and consumption of the olive oil.\n\n**Feedback loops** might involve the relationship between market demand and production adjustments. High demand can incentivize farmers to increase the area under cultivation or invest in more efficient extraction and processing technologies, thereby potentially increasing output.\n\nBoth examples demonstrate the intricate interplay of natural processes, human activity, and regulatory frameworks in resource management. Sustainable practices in both cases hinge on understanding these dynamics and implementing policies that align with long-term resource availability and ecosystem health.\n\n### References:\n- &quot;Chapter 6 \u2013 Stock and Flow Systems&quot;, *v7-Rueter*, 2013\n- Diana Fisher&#x27;s insights on system dynamics, *YouTube Video Transcript*, tactiq.io\n\nThese sources emphasize the importance of modeling and managing resources through a systems dynamics approach, where feedback loops, stock limitations, and flow rates are crucial to understanding and sustaining resource availability."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8887fc5b6ba30d6a-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "bb61bcc5-c64a-4676-bf01-977ae70b8e6c", "children": ["d6468918-e0d7-4ef9-8110-4dcd2e13d6fb"]}, "d6468918-e0d7-4ef9-8110-4dcd2e13d6fb": {"id": "d6468918-e0d7-4ef9-8110-4dcd2e13d6fb", "message": {"id": "d6468918-e0d7-4ef9-8110-4dcd2e13d6fb", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716498161.638422, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["### Systems Dynamics of Italian Bottled Mineral Water (Stock-Limited Resource)\n\nItalian bottled mineral water, exemplifying the management of a finite natural resource, underscores the delicate balance required between ecological stewardship and commercial exploitation.

Despite its importance in preserving rural landscape and in supporting household economy, the EVOO sector faces several constraints due to high management costs, small farm size, lack of cooperation and investment, production vulnerability, and farmers\u2019 ageing. Such a number of weak points suggests the need to identify and adopt innovative approaches, at both the farm and oil mill levels. In order to address these priorities, a fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) survey was carried out in Umbria region, central Italy, involving key local stakeholders of the EVOO value chain in the Orvieto district. Based on stakeholders\u2019 perception and knowledge, this paper aims to identify and evaluate the most relevant components of the local olive oil value chain, and predict scenarios responding to hypothetical changes of the same components. These stakeholders were firstly invited to each build an individual fuzzy cognitive map and then, grouped all together, build a joint fuzzy cognitive map. Finally, the maps represented both the individual and the grouped stakeholders\u2019 perceptions. The maps were translated into adjacency matrices in order to create an FCM model by applying the software \u201cMental Modeler\u201d. In total, 24 participants, including practitioners, multipliers, researchers, suppliers and members of local administration, participated in the survey. The component analysis and the scenario analysis highlighted several priority issues: to preserve the ecosystem functioning, to implement cooperation, innovation and education, to adapt and mitigate climate change. The main novelty of this study is that all stakeholders\u2019 categories in the EVOO sector recognize several challenges to sustain the EVOO value chain, in particular, climate change adaptation and mitigation.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Being a first-choice product, consumers should be guaranteed its quality and geographical origin, justifying the high purchasing cost. For this reason, it is important to have new reliable tools able to classify products according to their geographical origin. The aim of this work was to demonstrate the efficiency of an open source visible and near infra-red (VIS-NIR) spectrophotometer, relying on a specific app, in assessing olive oil geographical origin. Thus, 67 Italian and 25 foreign EVOO samples were analyzed and their spectral data were processed through an artificial intelligence algorithm. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results reported significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) between the Italian and foreign EVOO VIS-NIR matrices. The artificial neural network (ANN) model with an external test showed a correct classification percentage equal to 94.6%. Both the MANOVA and ANN tested methods showed the most important spectral wavelengths ranges for origin determination to be 308\u2013373 nm and 594\u2013605 nm. These are related to the absorption of phenolic components, carotenoids, chlorophylls, and anthocyanins. The proposed tool allows the assessment of EVOO samples\u2019 origin and thus could help to preserve the \u201cMade in Italy\u201d from fraud and sophistication related to its commerce.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

In this study, olive orchard cultivation, EVOO extraction, bottling, packaging, storage at -18\u00b0C and distribution in the main importing countries were studied from a life cycle assessment perspective, with the main objective of identifying the processes with the largest environmental impacts. The selected functional unit was 1L of EVOO, packaged for distribution. Inventory data was gathered mainly through both direct communication using questionnaires and direct measurements. To determine the CF the ISO/TS 14067:2013 was followed while the EF was evaluated according to ISO standards 14040 and 14044. Results showed that the most impacting process is the distribution, mainly due to the choice of employing air transport. The main other hot spots identified were the olive orchard fertilization, EVOO freezing during its storage at the olive mill factory and the manufacture of glass bottles. Suggested improvement opportunities included shifts in the EVOO transportation policy, the introduction of lighter glass bottles in the bottling process, the use of cooling agent with lower global warming potential and the employment of biodiesel in the farming machineries.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

In this research, minor amendments to product specification of Brisighella PDO approved by EU in 2016 are described. The proposed modifications to the Brisighella PDO product specification are supported by chemical-sensory analyses carried out on 15 EVOOs from cultivars autochthonous of the Emilia Romagna region (Nostrana di Brisighella and Ghiacciolo), selected as representative of 14 geographical sites (small farms) with different characteristics in terms of climatic and environmental conditions (e.g. altitude, geographical orientation and slope of the olive orchard) of the production area established in the product specification.

Our study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity exhibited by the polyphenolic extracts of EVOOs, obtained from three varieties of Olea europea L. (Ruvea antica, Ravece, and Ogliarola) cultivated in the village of Montella, Avellino, Southern Italy. The study evaluated the inhibiting effect of the extracts against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Microextracted olive oil samples from selected and genetically characterized olive trees were studied by 1H NMR-based metabolomic approach and multivariate analysis, according to cultivar and geographic origin, within the Apulia region. The 1H NMR spectra of oils were analyzed by several pattern recognition methods, using both unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (partial least squares discriminant analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)) statistical techniques. EVOOs obtained from secular olive trees could be easily differentiated by OPLS-DA not only depending on the used cultivars but also according to their geographical origin within the different districts of the Apulia region, such to justify a larger biodiversity maintenance of Apulia secular germplasm. Therefore, differences in chemical composition and NMR profiles of EVOOs may be explained either by cultivars or geographic areas. \\n \\n \\n \\nPractical applications: About 10% of the genetic olive tree patrimony within the Apulia region consists of the secular olive trees. A recently introduced regional law (No 14 of June 4th, 2007) allows to exploit oil produced from secular olive trees by labeling it with the special mention: \u201cextra virgin oil from the Apulia secular olive trees\u201d. Characterization of extra virgin olive oils obtained from secular trees may be an optimal solution to increase the value for this product and make it available on the market. On the other hand this economic issue is very important to preserve the unique landscape offered by the ancient olive groves of the Apulia region in south east Italy.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;L.

Headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) was applied for the very first time to the sampling of volatile compounds of eleven typical Italian monocultivar EVOOs. Forty-eight compounds were characterised by GC-MS, some of them were only occasionally found in other EVOOs and some other were never detected before in any EVOO. Compounds belonging mainly to alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones and hydrocarbons chemical classes characterised the volatile profiles. The main volatile compounds detected in the EVOOs were the C6 compounds derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids, through the lipoxygenase pathway, in different proportion according to the specific cultivar. The results suggest that genetic factors strongly influence volatile formation and terpene hydrocarbons are claimed to be suitable markers of the geographic origin and genotype of the EVOO. Correlations among sensory attributes evaluated by a panel test and the presence of specific volatile compounds were highlighted for the very first time. The significance of the presence of some newly identified volatile compounds was discussed.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;T. Cecchi&quot;,&quot;B.

The main characteristics of these oils are large total phenol content, low acidity and peroxide values, low oxidative susceptibilities. All the chemical parameters fell within the limits established for the maximum olive oil category. Sensory evaluation showed that the total score of all the monovarietal extra virgin olive oils was always much higher than the 6.5 limit established for the \u2018extra-virgin\u2019 category. The overall quality indices support claims of excellence for monovarietal EVOOs from this geographical area. Results from the present study are of key importance for the specific Production Standards a document that contains regulations for supervising the entire olive oil production cycle and a prerequisite for both the European Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) and Quality granted by the Marche region (QM) labels.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;T.

Its nutraceutical properties are due mainly, but not only, to a plethora of molecules with antioxidant activity known as biophenols. In this article, several biophenols were measured in EVOOs from South Apulia, Italy. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and their conjugated structures to elenolic acid in different forms were identified and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) together with lignans, luteolin and \u03b1-tocopherol. The concentration of the analyzed metabolites was quite high in all the cultivars studied, but it was still possible to discriminate them through multivariate statistical analysis (MVA). Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were also exploited for determining variances among samples depending on the interval time between harvesting and milling, on the age of the olive trees, and on the area where the olive trees were grown.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Andrea Ragusa&quot;,&quot;C.

In the EU, COO labeling has been made mandatory for several categories of food products, to enable consumers to make informed choices at the point of sale. In particular, Regulation (EU) No 29/2012 has introduced a mandatory country-of-origin labeling system for extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). In the present study, conducted in Italy, we test whether there is a price differential associated with the COO information for EVOO. To this end, we employ a hedonic price model and data about the purchase of EVOO products collected from 982 consumers at the supermarket checkout. Having interviewed these consumers, we also assess the share of EVOO consumers that correctly identify the country of origin of the product purchased. Our findings point out that, in Italy, the EVOO with domestic origin, indicated on the label, benefits of a premium price equal to +35% compared to the product labeled as blend of European EVOOs, while a discount of \u221210.8% is attached to EVOOs from a non-European origin. A significant share of consumers in our sample (19.04%) is, however, unable to correctly identify the origin of the EVOO purchased. This label misuse mostly occurs among consumers who report that they had purchased Italian EVOO, while they had actually purchased a blend of European EVOOs. Female and more highly educated consumers are less likely to misuse label information about the product\u2019s origins.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;F. Bimbo&quot;,&quot;L.

The present work is focused on commercial organic EVOO blends obtained by mixing multiple oils from different geographical origins. These blends have been studied by 1H-NMR spectroscopy supported by multivariate statistical analysis. Specific characteristics of commercial organic EVOO blends originated by mixing oils from Italy, Tunisia, Portugal, Spain, and Greece were found to be associated with the increasing content of the Italian component. A linear progression of the metabolic profile defined characteristics for the analysed samples\u2014up to a plateau level\u2014was found in relation to the content of the main constituent of the Italian oil, the monocultivar Coratina. The Italian constituent percentage appears to be correlated with the fatty acids (oleic) and the polyphenols (tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and derivatives) content as major and minor components respectively. These results, which highlight important economic aspects, also show the utility of 1H-NMR associated with chemometric analysis as a powerful tool in this field. Mixing oils of different national origins, to obtain blends with specific characteristics, could be profitably controlled by this methodology.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;F.

Chemometric methods such as unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed good discrimination and gave some affinity indications for the U.S. market olive oils compared to other single cultivars of extra virgin olive oil such as Coratina and Ogliarola from Apulia, one of Italy\u2019s leading olive oil producers, Picual (Spain), Kalamata (Greece) and Sfax (Tunisia). The olive oils commercially available as Italian products in the U.S. market clustered into 3 groups. Among them only the first (7 samples) and the second group (2 samples) showed PCA ranges similar to European references. Two oils of the third group (3 samples) were more similar to Tunisian references. In conclusion, our study revealed that most EVOO (extra virgin olive oils) tested were closer to Greek (in particular) and Spanish olive oils than Apulia EVOO. The PCA loadings disclose the components responsible for the discrimination as unsaturated (oleic, linoleic, linolenic) and saturated fatty acids. All are of great importance because of their nutritional value and differential effects on the oxidative stability of oils. It is evident that this approach has the potential to reveal the origin of EVOO, although the results support the need for a larger database, including EVOO from other Italian regions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;L.

In Italy, family farms (FFs) produce about 55% of EVOO, whereas 3% is produced by protected designation of origin (PDO) consortia. In this research, we compared chemical and phenolic quality parameters of 28 PDO oils and 256 FF oils. Acidity, peroxide index and UV spectroscopy indicated high quality of all FF and PDO oils. The phenolic alcohols, namely 3,4-(dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol (3,4-DHPEA or hydroxytyrosol) and p-(hydroxyphenyl)ethanol (p-HPEA or tyrosol), and the secoiridoids, that are the dialdehydic forms of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA) and to tyrosol (p-HPEA-EDA), respectively, the 3,4-(dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol elenolic acid (3,4-DHPEA-EA) and the p-(hydroxyphenyl)ethanol elenolic acid (p-HPEA-EA), were detected by HPLC-DAD. All PDO and FF olive oils satisfy the EU health claim conditions for phenol concentration. The relative percent of each secoiridoid derivative and phenolic alcohol resulted very similar in PDO and FF oils, with the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA as the major component. The lignans, (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, were also evaluated, with no significant differences between the two groups of oils. Finally, the discrepancy between the total phenol assayed by the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu reagent and the HPLC method was presented and discussed. Overall, the results point to the need to support the application of the HPLC assay for quality certification of FF oils in order to ensure proper recognition of these products as well as their more valorized market distribution.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;E.

A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to evaluate sample similarity. Secoiridoids (SIDs), lignans and flavonoids were the most abundant phenolic compounds identified. The organic Casaliva (among mono-cultivar) and the organic multi-varietal (among blended oils) EVOOs had the higher total phenol content both in early (263.13 and 326.19 mg/kg, respectively) and late harvest (241.88 and 292.34 mg/kg, respectively) conditions. In comparison to late harvest EVOOs, early harvest EVOOs, in particular the organic mono-cultivar Casaliva, showed both higher antioxidant capacity (up to 1285.97 Oxygen Radicals Absorbance Capacity/ORAC units), probably due to the higher SID fraction (54% vs. 40%), and higher \u03b1-tocopherol content (up to 280.67 mg/kg). Overall, these results suggest that SIDs and \u03b1-tocopherol mainly contribute to antioxidant properties of the studied EVOOs. In light of this, the authors conclude that early harvest, organic mono-cultivar Casaliva EVOO represents the most interesting candidate to explicate healthy effects ascribed to these functional constituents, particularly regarding oxidative stress-related pathologies.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;D.

Italy is one of the largest producers of olive oil, with numerous small-scale, family-owned farms contributing significantly to the industry. For the purpose of this analysis, we focus on Farchioni, a renowned EVOO producer with a long-standing market presence. Farchioni employs both traditional and modern methods in its production process, from olive cultivation to oil extraction and distribution. This blend of methods highlights both the potential and the challenges of achieving sustainability in a traditional yet globally significant industry.\n\nItaly&#x27;s EVOO production is characterized by a diversity of practices and regional specialties. The Umbria region, for instance, is noted for its small-scale farms that face several challenges, including high management costs, small farm sizes, and an aging farming population. Despite these challenges, innovative approaches such as fuzzy cognitive mapping have been employed to identify and address key issues in the EVOO value chain, focusing on sustainability and climate change adaptation (Pisanelli et al., 2023). Such regional studies underscore the importance of local knowledge and stakeholder engagement in preserving the cultural and economic heritage of EVOO production.\n\nThe integration of modern technology in EVOO production is exemplified by Farchioni\u2019s use of advanced methods for traceability and quality assurance. For example, open-source spectrophotometers coupled with artificial intelligence have proven effective in assessing the geographical origin of EVOO, ensuring authenticity and protecting against fraud. These technologies not only enhance consumer trust but also support the &quot;Made in Italy&quot; brand, which is crucial for maintaining the high market value of Italian EVOO (Violino et al., 2020).\n\nSustainability in EVOO production involves evaluating the environmental impacts throughout the entire lifecycle, from cultivation to distribution. A comprehensive study in Umbria assessed the carbon and energy footprints of EVOO, identifying distribution and packaging as significant sources of environmental impact. Recommendations for improvement include shifts in transportation policies, the use of lighter packaging materials, and the adoption of renewable energy sources in farming operations (Rinaldi et al., 2014). These findings highlight the potential for reducing the environmental footprint of EVOO through targeted interventions in the production process.\n\nIn conclusion, the EVOO industry in Italy, represented by producers like Farchioni, balances tradition with innovation to maintain its global reputation. The use of modern technologies for traceability and quality control, coupled with sustainability initiatives, ensures that Italian EVOO remains a premium product on the global market. The ongoing challenges and innovative responses underscore the dynamic nature of this ancient industry, poised to address contemporary issues while preserving its rich heritage.\n\nLike our GPT?

As a technology enthusiast and a regular user of the iPhone SE, I have a keen interest in understanding the sustainability of this product. This paper examines the sustainability metrics associated with the iPhone SE, exploring its material and energy intensity, water consumption, toxic emissions, and pollutants. Additionally, it proposes a supply chain model and outlines measures that could enhance sustainability if I were to assume the role of Chief Sustainability Officer at Apple.\n\n**Sustainability Metrics**\n\nThe seven principles of sustainability\u2014ecology, environment, society, economy, well-being, longevity, and justice\u2014form the foundation of the sustainability metrics for evaluating the iPhone SE (United Nations, 2020). The key metrics include:\n\n1. **Material Intensity**: Assessing the quantity and type of materials used, including rare earth minerals.\n2. **Energy Intensity**: Measuring the energy consumption during production and usage.\n3. **Water Consumption**: Evaluating the water used in the manufacturing process.\n4. **Toxic Emissions**: Identifying pollutants and toxic substances released during production.\n5. **Pollutants**: Assessing the impact of pollutants on air, water, and soil.\n6. **Human Health and Well-being**: Evaluating the impact on workers&#x27; health and safety.\n7. **Fair Wages and Working Conditions**: Ensuring ethical labor practices and fair wages.\n\n**Material and Energy Intensity**\n\nThe iPhone SE incorporates several materials, including aluminum, glass, and rare earth elements such as neodymium, terbium, and dysprosium (Apple, 2020). These materials are essential for the phone&#x27;s functionality, particularly in its speakers and taptic engine. However, the extraction of rare earth minerals often involves significant environmental degradation and energy consumption.\n\nThe energy intensity of the iPhone SE is another critical metric. Apple has made strides in reducing energy consumption during both production and usage. According to Apple (2020), the company has shifted to using 100% renewable energy in its manufacturing facilities, significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated with the iPhone SE.\n\n**Water Consumption**\n\nWater is a crucial resource in the production of electronic devices. The manufacturing process of the iPhone SE involves substantial water usage, particularly in the cleaning and cooling processes (Hoekstra et al., 2012). Apple has implemented water recycling programs in its factories to mitigate the impact on local water resources.\n\n**Toxic Emissions and Pollutants**\n\nThe production of electronic devices often results in the release of toxic emissions and pollutants. The iPhone SE&#x27;s manufacturing process involves the emission of greenhouse gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other pollutants. Apple has implemented measures to minimize these emissions, such as using low-VOC materials and improving energy efficiency (Apple, 2020).\n\n**Supply Chain Model**\n\nThe supply chain of the iPhone SE begins with the extraction of raw materials, followed by refinement, manufacturing, distribution, and sale. The process involves multiple stages:\n\n1. **Extraction**: Mining of raw materials, including aluminum and rare earth elements.\n2. **Refinement**: Processing raw materials to obtain the necessary components.\n3. **Manufacturing**: Assembling the components into the final product at Apple&#x27;s manufacturing facilities.\n4. **Distribution**: Shipping the products to various distribution centers worldwide.\n5. **Sale**: Selling the iPhone SE to consumers through Apple stores and authorized retailers.\n\n**Gaps in Information Availability**\n\nWhile Apple provides some information on its sustainability practices, there are gaps in data availability, particularly regarding the detailed environmental impact of each stage of the supply chain. Research on similar products can provide insights into the potential environmental and social impacts of the iPhone SE. For example, studies on the environmental footprint of smartphones by Boubault et al. (2020) and Nimpuno et al. (2019) can offer valuable data for inferring the sustainability of the iPhone SE.\n\n**Measures for Enhancing Sustainability**\n\nAs the Chief Sustainability Officer at Apple, my priority would be to implement measures that enhance the sustainability of the iPhone SE. Key measures include:\n\n1. **Reducing Material Intensity**: Innovating to use fewer rare earth minerals and increasing the use of recycled materials.\n2. **Improving Energy Efficiency**: Continuing to invest in renewable energy and improving energy efficiency in production.\n3. **Minimizing Water Usage**: Expanding water recycling programs and developing water-efficient manufacturing processes.\n4. **Reducing Toxic Emissions**: Implementing stricter controls on emissions and transitioning to non-toxic materials.\n5. **Enhancing Transparency**: Providing detailed reports on the environmental and social impact of the supply chain.\n6. **Promoting Fair Labor Practices**: Ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions for all workers in the supply chain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe iPhone SE (2nd Generation) represents a blend of technological innovation and sustainability efforts by Apple. However, there are significant challenges in achieving comprehensive sustainability, particularly concerning material and energy intensity, water consumption, and toxic emissions. By implementing robust sustainability measures and enhancing transparency, Apple can further mitigate the environmental and social impacts of its products. The journey towards sustainability is continuous, requiring ongoing commitment and innovation.\n\n**References**\n\nApple. (2020). Environmental Progress Report.

Introduction**\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is a staple in Italian cuisine, known for its health benefits and culinary versatility. However, the production of EVOO, like many agricultural products, poses sustainability challenges that must be addressed to ensure long-term viability and minimal environmental impact. This paper critically examines the sustainability of EVOO production, emphasizing the need for cooperative systems of resource allocation to promote a more sustainable future.\n\n**II. Background of EVOO Production**\n\nEVOO production in Italy has a rich history, dating back to ancient times. Italy is one of the largest producers of olive oil, with many small-scale, family-owned farms contributing to the industry. This paper focuses on the company Farchioni, a renowned EVOO producer with a long-standing market presence. Farchioni employs traditional and modern methods in its production process, from olive cultivation to oil extraction and distribution.\n\n**III. Sustainability Metrics**\n\nTo assess the sustainability of EVOO production, we will use the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency, substitution, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, social sustainability, inter-generational equity, and institutional sustainability. The specific metrics for EVOO production include material intensity, energy intensity, water consumption, toxic emissions and pollutants, human health and safety, fair wages and working conditions, and community impact.\n\n**IV. Analysis of Sustainability Indicators**\n\n**A. Material Intensity**\n\nEVOO production involves various materials, including glass bottles for packaging and metal for processing equipment. The extraction and processing of these materials can have significant environmental impacts. For instance, glass production is energy-intensive and contributes to CO2 emissions (Barber &amp; Taylor, 2018).\n\n**B. Energy Intensity**\n\nThe energy consumption in EVOO production is substantial, from powering irrigation systems to operating processing facilities. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, can reduce the carbon footprint of these operations (G\u00f3mez-Lim\u00f3n &amp; Sanchez-Fernandez, 2010).\n\n**C. Water Consumption**\n\nWater is essential for olive cultivation, especially in arid regions. Sustainable water management practices, such as drip irrigation, can significantly reduce water usage and mitigate the impact on local water resources (Berbel &amp; Mesa-Jurado, 2015).\n\n**D. Toxic Emissions and Pollutants**\n\nThe use of pesticides and fertilizers in olive farming can lead to soil and water contamination. Additionally, emissions from transportation and processing contribute to air pollution. Implementing organic farming practices and optimizing logistics can help reduce these impacts (G\u00f3mez-Lim\u00f3n &amp; Sanchez-Fernandez, 2010).\n\n**E. Human Health and Safety**\n\nExposure to chemicals and poor working conditions can pose health risks to workers. Ensuring the use of safe, non-toxic inputs and providing proper safety training and equipment are crucial for protecting worker health (Palomo-Campesino, Lima, &amp; Sainz, 2018).\n\n**F. Fair Wages and Working Conditions**\n\nFair wages and decent working conditions are essential for the social sustainability of the olive oil industry. Ensuring compliance with labor laws and supporting fair trade practices can improve workers&#x27; quality of life (Palomo-Campesino, Lima, &amp; Sainz, 2018).\n\n**G. Community Impact**\n\nEVOO production can have positive impacts on local economies by providing jobs and supporting local businesses. Companies like Farchioni engage in social responsibility initiatives that benefit local communities, such as supporting local education and healthcare (Farchioni, 2021).\n\n**V. Supply Chain Model**\n\n**A. Supply Chain Stages**\n\n1. **Olive Cultivation and Harvesting**: Olives are grown and harvested using traditional and mechanical methods.\n2. **Processing and Extraction**: Olives are processed into oil using milling and pressing techniques.\n3. **Packaging and Storage**: The oil is bottled, typically in glass, and stored under controlled conditions.\n4. **Distribution and Retail**: The bottled oil is distributed to retailers and sold to consumers.\n\n**B. Visual Representation**\n\n(Include a diagram of the supply chain model here.)\n\n**C. Discussion of Sustainability at Each Stage**\n\nEach stage of the supply chain presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. For example, improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the overall sustainability of the product.\n\n**VI. Information Gaps and Inferences**\n\n**A. Identified Gaps in Available Data**\n\nThere is a lack of comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production, particularly regarding the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing.\n\n**B. Inferences from Similar Products or Studies**\n\nComparative analysis with other agricultural products, such as wine or almond production, can provide insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products have shown that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints (Capone, Elia, &amp; Lops, 2016).\n\n**VII. Role as Chief Sustainability Officer**\n\n**A. Proposed Sustainability Measures**\n\n1. **Enhancing Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Use**: Invest in energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources for production facilities.\n2. **Implementing Sustainable Water Management Practices**: Adopt advanced irrigation techniques and water recycling systems.\n3. **Improving Waste Management and Reducing Emissions**: Develop waste reduction strategies and optimize logistics to minimize emissions.\n4. **Ensuring Fair Wages and Safe Working Conditions**: Enforce fair labor practices and provide comprehensive safety training for workers.\n\n**B. Measuring Progress**\n\n1. **Setting Specific, Measurable Goals**: Establish clear sustainability targets for energy use, water consumption, and waste reduction.\n2. **Regular Sustainability Audits and Reporting**: Conduct periodic audits and publicly report on sustainability performance.\n3. **Engaging Stakeholders and Fostering Transparency**: Involve stakeholders in sustainability initiatives and maintain open communication about progress and challenges.\n\n**VIII. Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the sustainability of EVOO production can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use, water consumption, emissions, and social impacts. Cooperative systems of resource allocation, emphasizing community involvement and fair practices, are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry.\n\n**IX.

However, like many agricultural products, EVOO production poses several sustainability challenges that need to be addressed to ensure long-term viability and minimal environmental impact. This paper critically examines the sustainability of EVOO production, emphasizing the need for cooperative systems of resource allocation to promote a more sustainable future.\n\n**Background of EVOO Production**\n\nEVOO production in Italy has a rich history dating back to ancient times. Italy is one of the largest producers of olive oil, with numerous small-scale, family-owned farms contributing significantly to the industry. For the purpose of this analysis, we focus on Farchioni, a renowned EVOO producer with a long-standing market presence. Farchioni employs both traditional and modern methods in its production process, from olive cultivation to oil extraction and distribution. This blend of methods highlights both the potential and the challenges of achieving sustainability in a traditional yet globally significant industry.\n\n**Sustainability Metrics**\n\nTo assess the sustainability of EVOO production, we adopt the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency, substitution, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, social sustainability, inter-generational equity, and institutional sustainability. Specific metrics tailored to EVOO production include material intensity, energy intensity, water consumption, toxic emissions and pollutants, human health and safety, fair wages and working conditions, and community impact.\n\n**Analysis of Sustainability Indicators**\n\nMaterial intensity in EVOO production involves various materials, such as glass bottles for packaging and metal for processing equipment. The extraction and processing of these materials have significant environmental impacts. For instance, glass production is energy-intensive and contributes to CO2 emissions (Barber &amp; Taylor, 2018). Energy consumption in EVOO production is substantial, from powering irrigation systems to operating processing facilities. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, can reduce the carbon footprint of these operations (G\u00f3mez-Lim\u00f3n &amp; Sanchez-Fernandez, 2010).\n\nWater consumption is another critical factor. Olive cultivation requires substantial water, especially in arid regions. Sustainable water management practices, such as drip irrigation, can significantly reduce water usage and mitigate impacts on local water resources (Berbel &amp; Mesa-Jurado, 2015). The use of pesticides and fertilizers in olive farming leads to soil and water contamination, while emissions from transportation and processing contribute to air pollution. Implementing organic farming practices and optimizing logistics can help reduce these impacts (G\u00f3mez-Lim\u00f3n &amp; Sanchez-Fernandez, 2010).\n\nHuman health and safety are also paramount. Exposure to chemicals and poor working conditions pose significant health risks to workers. Ensuring the use of safe, non-toxic inputs and providing proper safety training and equipment are crucial (Palomo-Campesino, Lima, &amp; Sainz, 2018). Additionally, fair wages and decent working conditions are essential for the social sustainability of the olive oil industry. Ensuring compliance with labor laws and supporting fair trade practices can improve workers&#x27; quality of life (Palomo-Campesino, Lima, &amp; Sainz, 2018).\n\nEVOO production can have positive impacts on local economies by providing jobs and supporting local businesses. Companies like Farchioni engage in social responsibility initiatives that benefit local communities, such as supporting local education and healthcare (Farchioni, 2021).\n\n**Supply Chain Model**\n\nThe supply chain for EVOO includes several stages: olive cultivation and harvesting, processing and extraction, packaging and storage, and distribution and retail. Each stage presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. For example, improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the overall sustainability of the product.\n\n**Information Gaps and Inferences**\n\nThere are notable gaps in available data, particularly regarding comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production. Data on the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing is limited. However, comparative analysis with similar agricultural products, such as wine or almond production, provides insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products show that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints (Capone, Elia, &amp; Lops, 2016).\n\n**Role as Chief Sustainability Officer**\n\nAs Chief Sustainability Officer, several measures can be prioritized to enhance sustainability in the company&#x27;s operations. These include enhancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use, implementing sustainable water management practices, improving waste management and reducing emissions, and ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions. Progress can be measured by setting specific, measurable goals, conducting regular sustainability audits, publicly reporting on sustainability performance, engaging stakeholders, and maintaining open communication about progress and challenges.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the sustainability of EVOO production can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use, water consumption, emissions, and social impacts. Cooperative systems of resource allocation, emphasizing community involvement and fair practices, are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry. By adopting these measures, companies can contribute to a more sustainable future while maintaining the cultural and economic significance of EVOO production in Italy.\n\n**References**\n\nBarber, J., &amp; Taylor, J.

We believe that an individual&#x27;s happiness is not just a personal achievement but a societal asset. A content person is a beacon of positivity capable of enriching their community. When we collectively strive for happiness we also invest in our well-being and foster a society free from the shackles of discontent. These ideas reflect our vision where individual happiness is the cornerstone of societal harmony.\nAs the renowned author John Donne (2010)  famously proclaimed \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d This sentiment holds true in our pursuit of societal greatness. Achieving this requires unity and collaboration. However when an individual is grappling with internal conflicts such as mental health struggles physical ailments and a general decline in well-being overcoming these challenges alone becomes an insurmountable task. Wellness is not just a personal concern but a societal issue that impacts us all.\nIn addition to discussing wellness it is necessary also to address the role of education. If wellness is the foundation education is the next step where individuals acquire the necessary skills to lead purposeful dignified and joyful lives. Nobody is inherently equipped with the knowledge to improve their surroundings; it must be learned. Therefore education holds equal significance in the pursuit of wellness. As one begins to grasp the world&#x27;s order concepts like the principles of space and time the philosophies of Aristotle the mathematics of our universe and the evocative poetry of Yates one starts to perceive the world in a new nuanced way. Therefore to truly understand oneself it is sometimes necessary to first understand one&#x27;s environment. Thus in parallel with well-being education holds great importance.\nAs individuals gain knowledge about the world around them they instinctively desire to explore it further engaging with it through the senses of touch taste and sight. Rather than solely studying Mozart and reading musical notations experiencing the music in person is essential. Therefore travel is an invaluable gateway to becoming a well-rounded individual capable of positively contributing to society.\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to creating a better world. By leveraging the support of donor investors the foundation aims to empower individuals to pursue their own happiness by providing necessary tools. Our efforts involve establishing partnerships with local government bodies and healthcare providers to ensure easy access to government services and healthcare and make travel accessible to all who desire it. These initiatives will lay the foundation for our long-term vision of a globally interconnected and joyful society.\nPurpose\nThe primary purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally through increased access to essential life-enhancing services. The Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to providing the necessary tools for individuals to pursue their happiness. Our starting point is ensuring access to healthcare and mental health services as a fundamental human right and a crucial component in our efforts to build a better world. We also aim to utilize well-being travel cultural immersion and education resources to empower individuals to gain self-awareness understand others and collectively achieve holistic happiness.\nGoals\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to enhancing the global quality of life through two strategic goals.\n\nLong-term Goal: Increase Access to Key Well-being Services\nOur long-term goal is to significantly increase access to key well-being services globally with our efforts first being localized in the United States and Italy. By doing so we aim to improve the quality of life and foster sustained happiness in diverse communities. This goal will not only benefit the communities we serve but also provide donor-investors with the satisfaction of knowing that their support is making a tangible difference in people&#x27;s lives. The impact of these programs will be measured by tracking the number of individuals accessing these services the improvement in health and education outcomes and overall satisfaction rates among participants reflecting the direct benefits of our initiatives.\nShort-term Goal: Establish and Strengthen Partnerships\nPartnerships are at the heart of our strategy. Our short-term goal is to establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international public and private organizations. These partnerships are not just beneficial they are crucial for enhancing our capability to deliver critical services effectively and efficiently. By collaborating with organizations with established infrastructures and expertise in our target regions we can leverage their strengths to better serve the communities&#x27; needs. Formalizing at least five significant partnerships within the first six months will be vital to achieving this goal.\nBoth goals complement existing efforts in the target communities rather than duplicate them ensuring that our interventions add value and create a measurable impact. Through these focused efforts the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation seeks to build a foundation for long-term social change that contributes to the well-being of individuals worldwide.\nObjectives\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) has set ambitious yet achievable objectives to ensure a broad and lasting impact on global well-being.\nEducational Expansion\nOur first objective focuses on education expansion. Within the first year GHIF plans to launch educational programs in at least two countries aiming to reach over 5000 individuals. These programs will be developed to address local educational gaps better equip youths with functional skills  and promote holistic learning experiences. Evidence shows that educational programs can significantly enhance psychological well-being by increasing self-efficacy social support and overall life satisfaction (Ross &amp; Willigen 1997). Moreover education has been linked to improved health outcomes and better mental health with increased years of education correlating with lower rates of depression and anxiety (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder 2022). The success of these programs will be measured by the number of programs successfully launched the total number of participants enrolled and participant feedback on program effectiveness.\nHealthcare Partnerships\nSimultaneously GHIF aims to establish healthcare partnerships to enhance access to medical and mental health services. By the end of the first six months we will secure partnerships with at least five major healthcare providers. These collaborations will focus on providing comprehensive health services emphasizing preventive care and mental health which are crucial for improving individual well-being. Studies have shown that partnerships between educational institutions and healthcare providers can significantly improve health outcomes particularly in preventive care and mental health services (Ross &amp; Wu 1995). The effectiveness of these partnerships will be assessed through the number of agreements signed the range of services provided and feedback from service users regarding the accessibility and quality of care.\nWellness Travel Model\nLastly our third objective is to develop a wellness travel model which will be designed developed and ready for implementation within the first eighteen months. This model will provide frameworks for wellness-oriented travel experiences promoting mental and physical health benefits through carefully crafted travel packages. Wellness programs embedded in educational and travel contexts have shown positive impacts on well-being reducing stress and improving mental health (Young et al. 2020). The model\u2019s success will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction measured through surveys and the repeat engagement rate indicating the model&#x27;s appeal and effectiveness in enhancing participants&#x27; well-being.\nOrganizational Capacity\nFoundation Structure and Management Capability:\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is designed to be a robust organization capable of managing large-scale projects and substantial grants. At its inception GHIF will establish a governance structure with a board of directors comprising education healthcare mental health and non-profit management experts. This board will provide strategic oversight and ensure all activities align with our mission and objectives.\nFounding Team Expertise:\nThe founding team of GHIF will include highly qualified professionals selected for their extensive experience in project management international development healthcare and educational programming. Our recruitment strategy focuses on identifying individuals with a proven track record such as a Project Director with significant experience in managing and scaling community health programs an Education Specialist renowned for developing effective curricula in diverse cultural settings and a Mental Health Advocate with a strong background in leading global mental wellness initiatives. This planned assembly of expertise ensures a comprehensive and skilled approach to achieving the foundation\u2019s objectives.\nProject Management Systems:\nGHIF will implement rigorous project management methodologies to oversee all foundation activities. We will utilize established frameworks such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guidelines to plan execute monitor and close projects. Additionally GHIF will adopt modern project management tools for real-time tracking and reporting facilitating transparent and efficient management of the grant funds.\nPreparatory Actions for Grant Management:\nPrior to receiving the grant GHIF will:\nFormulate detailed project plans including timelines budgets and resource allocation.\nEstablish financial management policies tailored to ensure accountability and prudent use of funds.\nInitiate discussions with potential partners and stakeholders to build a support network for immediate project launch upon funding.\nDemonstrating Capacity through Strategic Intentions:\nWhile GHIF is a nascent organization our strategic planning reflects a clear and actionable roadmap for immediate impact upon funding. The foundation\u2019s goals are backed by a commitment to leverage the diverse skills of its team and the strategic insights of its board to establish a high-performing organization. GHIF&#x27;s initial actions and detailed project preparations demonstrate our readiness and capability to effectively manage and utilize the grant to achieve significant social impact.\nCross-Sector Collaboration \nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to developing localized high-impact programs that serve as models for global implementation. To achieve this GHIF emphasizes cross-sector collaboration mainly focusing on strategic partnerships in Italy and the United States. These collaborations are designed to leverage regional strengths and address specific local needs ensuring the adaptability and effectiveness of our well-being services.\nLocalized Educational Partnerships\nGHIF will collaborate with leading educational institutions in Italy and the United States to integrate well-being practices into educational curricula. This initiative will focus on regions with significant disparities in educational outcomes providing targeted interventions that are culturally and contextually relevant. Research indicates that collaborative learning environments and educational partnerships can significantly enhance student outcomes and well-being (Kilgo et al. 2015). Success in these partnerships will be evaluated based on educational improvements student well-being metrics and the scalability of the programs to other regions.\nHealthcare Alliances\nGHIF plans to partner with healthcare organizations in Italy and the United States to increase access to quality health services. These partnerships will focus on integrating mental health services with primary care a critical need in both countries according to local health reports. Studies have shown cross-sector healthcare collaborations can improve health outcomes particularly when mental health services are integrated with primary care (Randall et al. 2023). By working with local health providers and community organizations these initiatives aim to create sustainable health improvement models suitable for global replication.\nPublic-Private Partnerships\nGHIF will seek partnerships with local government bodies and private sectors in Italy and the United States to support infrastructure development vital to program delivery. These partnerships will help facilitate the creation of community wellness centers which will serve as hubs for education healthcare and community activities. Effective public-private partnerships have been shown to significantly enhance community health and well-being (Ovseiko et al. 2014). The effectiveness of these centers will be measured through community engagement rates and the overall improvement in community health and educational outcomes.\nCommunity Engagement\nIntegral to our strategy is the direct involvement of local communities in Italy and the United States in the planning and implementation phases. GHIF believes that community input is essential to tailoring programs that genuinely reflect and meet local needs. Feedback mechanisms and community advisory boards will be established to monitor the programs\u2019 impacts and guide iterative improvements as evidence proves that community involvement is crucial for the success and sustainability of public health programs (Mattessich &amp; Rausch 2014).\nProgram Plan\nIntroduction to Program Strategy\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to addressing critical needs in communities across the United States and Italy. We implement multifaceted strategies that enhance individual well-being and community health specifically designed to complement rather than duplicate existing services. Our comprehensive approach leverages local strengths and targets specific challenges through innovative and sustainable solutions.\nIntegration with Government and Healthcare Services\nOur initiative targets significant gaps in access to healthcare and government support services. These gaps have been identified through extensive community outreach and stakeholder engagement underscoring a pressing need for improved service accessibility and quality. To address these challenges GHIF plans to forge strategic alliances with local health departments and social service agencies creating a referral network that simplifies the process for individuals to access the services they need. This network aims to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of health and social care systems.\nPartnership development is crucial for the success of our healthcare integration strategy. By collaborating with local health authorities and service providers we aim to establish robust partnerships that facilitate streamlined access to healthcare and support services. These partnerships will be foundational in building a comprehensive referral system that enhances service delivery and meets the specific needs of the communities we serve.\nIn addition to building partnerships GHIF will engage in advocacy and policy work to enhance healthcare delivery. We will work closely with policymakers to advocate for regulations and policies prioritizing the health and well-being of underrepresented communities. Our focus on advocacy aims to influence policy changes that improve healthcare accessibility and address systemic barriers in service delivery.\nTraining community health workers is another critical component of our strategy. GHIF will implement comprehensive training programs designed to enhance the capabilities of health workers in assisting individuals effectively. These programs will focus on developing empathy technical skills and a deep understanding of the healthcare system. This will ensure that community health workers are well-equipped to support individuals in navigating health and social services.\nWellness Travel Model\nGHIF recognizes the therapeutic potential of travel in promoting mental and physical well-being. To harness this potential we are developing a Wellness Travel Model that integrates health benefits with cultural and educational experiences. This innovative approach to wellness extends beyond traditional health settings and includes travel packages that feature guided meditations wellness workshops and cultural tours. Each package is designed in collaboration with travel experts and cultural institutions to ensure that it offers genuine health benefits and facilitates cultural appreciation.\nCommunity-based involvement is integral to the design and execution of our Wellness Travel Model. We engage local communities in developing travel experiences to ensure that they are culturally respectful and enriching for visitors and hosts. This engagement helps create authentic travel experiences sensitive to the host communities&#x27; cultural dynamics and provides meaningful interactions that benefit all participants.\nHolistic Educational Access\nGHIF is also dedicated to transforming educational access by integrating a curriculum that includes advanced technology training and comprehensive arts education. This holistic approach aims to bridge the gap in technological and creative skills preparing individuals for the demands of the modern workforce and personal development. Our curriculum includes coding robotics visual arts and music training and is designed to be integrated into school systems and community learning centers.\nGHIF will establish ongoing learning opportunities through workshops and seminars open to all age groups to complement our formal education initiatives. These initiatives focus on continuous skill development and personal growth promoting lifelong learning and adaptability. By offering workshops and seminars that cover a range of skills and artistic disciplines we aim to foster an environment of continuous learning and creative exploration.\nTimeline and Evaluation\nThe timeline for these initiatives is strategically set to ensure a phased implementation. By the end of the second quarter of 2025 GHIF will establish the initial partnerships necessary for the referral systems and develop training programs for community health workers. Following the establishment of partnerships early in the same year the Wellness Travel Packages are expected to be launched by the third quarter of 2025. Educational program rollouts will begin in the fourth quarter of 2024 and be fully implemented across targeted regions by the second quarter of 2025.\nEach element of the program plan is designed to measure specific outcomes related to access satisfaction and educational attainment ensuring that GHIF&#x27;s interventions create measurable and sustainable impacts in the communities served. This strategic planning demonstrates GHIF&#x27;s capability to manage a large grant effectively and fulfill its mission of building a foundation for long-term social change that contributes significantly to global well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\t\nDeliverables\t\nActivities\t\nDue Date\t\nExpected Challenges\n\t\nSet up Referral Systems\t\nEstablish partnerships develop training for staff\t\nQ2 2025\t\nRegulatory hurdles securing partner cooperation\n\t\nLaunch Wellness Travel Packages\t\nDesign packages negotiate with travel agencies\t\nQ3 2025\t\nLogistics coordination ensuring accessibility and inclusion\n\t\nRollout Educational Programs\t\nDevelop curricula and integrate into schools\t\nQ4 2025\t\nAdaptation to local educational standards funding\n\t\nPublic Workshops and Seminars\t\nPlan and implement workshops and lifelong learning seminars\t\nQ1 2026\t\nCommunity engagement sustaining interest over time\n\n\nReferences\nCunningham W.

A content person is a beacon of positivity, capable of enriching their community. When we collectively strive for happiness, we also invest in our well-being and foster a society free from the shackles of discontent. These ideas reflect the vision of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation, where individual happiness is the cornerstone of societal harmony.\r\nAs the renowned author John Donne (2010)  famously proclaimed, \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d This sentiment holds true in our pursuit of societal greatness. Achieving this requires unity and collaboration. However, when an individual is grappling with internal conflicts, such as mental health struggles, physical ailments, and a general decline in well-being, overcoming these challenges alone becomes an insurmountable task. Wellness is not just a personal concern but a societal issue that impacts us all.\r\nIn addition to discussing wellness, it is necessary also to address the role of education. If wellness is the foundation, education is the next step, where individuals acquire the necessary skills to lead purposeful, dignified, and joyful lives. Nobody is inherently equipped with the knowledge to improve their surroundings; it must be learned. Therefore, education holds equal significance in the pursuit of wellness. As one begins to grasp the world&#x27;s order, concepts like the principles of space and time, the philosophies of Aristotle, the mathematics of our universe, and the evocative poetry of Yates, one starts to perceive the world in a new, nuanced way. Therefore, to truly understand oneself, it is sometimes necessary to first understand one&#x27;s environment. Thus, in parallel with well-being, education holds great importance.\r\nAs individuals gain knowledge about the world around them, they instinctively desire to explore it further, engaging with it through the senses of touch, taste, and sight. Rather than solely studying Mozart and reading musical notations, experiencing the music in person is essential. Therefore, travel is an invaluable gateway to becoming a well-rounded individual capable of positively contributing to society.\r\nWith these considerations in mind, the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation aspires to contribute to creating a better world. The foundation aims to utilize the contributions from donor investors to foster a happier world by empowering individuals to pursue their own happiness through the provision of necessary tools. Our efforts here will establish the groundwork for our long-term vision of a globally interconnected and joyful society.\r\nPurpose\r\nThe primary purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally through increased access to essential life-enhancing services. The Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to providing the necessary tools for individuals to pursue their happiness. Our starting point is ensuring access to healthcare and mental health services as a fundamental human right and a crucial component in our efforts to build a better world. We also aim to utilize well-being travel, cultural immersion, and education resources to empower individuals to gain self-awareness, understand others, and collectively achieve holistic happiness.\r\nGoals\r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to enhancing the global quality of life through two strategic goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong-term Goal: Increase Access to Key Well-being Services\r\nOur long-term goal is to significantly increase access to key well-being services globally, with our efforts first being localized in the United States and Italy. By doing so, we aim to improve the quality of life and foster sustained happiness in diverse communities. This goal will be pursued by developing scalable programs that provide essential services such as healthcare, education, and mental wellness. Research indicates that access to healthcare services positively impacts health-related quality of life, particularly among vulnerable populations (Cunningham et al., 1998). Improved access to care has been shown to enhance physical and mental health outcomes, highlighting the importance of such initiatives (Gu et al., 2009). The impact of these programs will be measured by tracking the number of individuals accessing these services, the improvement in health and education outcomes, and overall satisfaction rates among participants, reflecting the direct benefits of our initiatives.\r\nShort-term Goal: Establish and Strengthen Partnerships\r\nSimultaneously, our short-term goal is to establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international organizations. These partnerships are crucial for enhancing our capability to deliver critical services effectively and efficiently. By collaborating with organizations with established infrastructures and expertise in our target regions, we can leverage their strengths to better serve the communities&#x27; needs. Formalizing at least five significant partnerships within the first six months will be vital to achieving this goal. Effective partnerships have been shown to improve service delivery and accessibility, leading to better health outcomes (Seid et al., 2006). These partnerships will be evaluated based on the operational synergy achieved and the speed at which services are deployed to the beneficiaries.\r\nBoth goals complement existing efforts in the target communities rather than duplicate them, ensuring that our interventions add value and create a measurable impact. Through these focused efforts, the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation seeks to build a foundation for long-term social change that contributes to the well-being of individuals worldwide.\r\nObjectives\r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) has set ambitious yet achievable objectives to ensure a broad and lasting impact on global well-being.\r\nEducational Expansion\r\nOur first objective focuses on education expansion. Within the first year, GHIF plans to launch educational programs in at least two countries, aiming to reach over 5000 individuals. These programs will be developed to address local educational gaps and promote holistic learning experiences. Evidence shows that educational programs can significantly enhance psychological well-being by increasing self-efficacy, social support, and overall life satisfaction (Ross &amp; Willigen, 1997). Moreover, education has been linked to improved health outcomes and better mental health, with increased years of education correlating with lower rates of depression and anxiety (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder, 2022). The success of these programs will be measured by the number of programs successfully launched, the total number of participants enrolled, and participant feedback on program effectiveness.\r\nHealthcare Partnerships\r\nSimultaneously, GHIF aims to establish healthcare partnerships to enhance access to medical and mental health services. By the end of the first six months, we will secure partnerships with at least five major healthcare providers. These collaborations will focus on providing comprehensive health services emphasizing preventive care and mental health, which are crucial for improving individual well-being. Studies have shown that partnerships between educational institutions and healthcare providers can significantly improve health outcomes, particularly in preventive care and mental health services (Ross &amp; Wu, 1995). The effectiveness of these partnerships will be assessed through the number of agreements signed, the range of services provided, and feedback from service users regarding the accessibility and quality of care.\r\nWellness Travel Model\r\nLastly, our third objective is to develop a wellness travel model, which will be designed, developed, and ready for implementation within the first eighteen months. This model will provide frameworks for wellness-oriented travel experiences, promoting mental and physical health benefits through carefully crafted travel packages. Wellness programs embedded in educational and travel contexts have shown positive impacts on well-being, reducing stress and improving mental health (Young et al., 2020). The model\u2019s success will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction measured through surveys and the repeat engagement rate, indicating the model&#x27;s appeal and effectiveness in enhancing participants&#x27; well-being.\r\nOrganizational Capacity\r\nFoundation Structure and Management Capability:\r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is designed to be a robust organization capable of managing large-scale projects and substantial grants. At its inception, GHIF will establish a governance structure with a board of directors comprising education, healthcare, mental health, and non-profit management experts. This board will provide strategic oversight and ensure all activities align with our mission and objectives.\r\nFounding Team Expertise:\r\nThe founding team of GHIF will include highly qualified professionals selected for their extensive experience in project management, international development, healthcare, and educational programming. Our recruitment strategy focuses on identifying individuals with a proven track record, such as a Project Director with significant experience in managing and scaling community health programs, an Education Specialist renowned for developing effective curricula in diverse cultural settings, and a Mental Health Advocate with a strong background in leading global mental wellness initiatives. This planned assembly of expertise ensures a comprehensive and skilled approach to achieving the foundation\u2019s objectives.\r\nProject Management Systems:\r\nGHIF will implement rigorous project management methodologies to oversee all foundation activities. We will utilize established frameworks such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guidelines to plan, execute, monitor, and close projects. Additionally, GHIF will adopt modern project management tools for real-time tracking and reporting, facilitating transparent and efficient management of the grant funds.\r\nPreparatory Actions for Grant Management:\r\nPrior to receiving the grant, GHIF will:\r\n1. Formulate detailed project plans, including timelines, budgets, and resource allocation.\r\n2. Establish financial management policies tailored to ensure accountability and prudent use of funds.\r\n3. Initiate discussions with potential partners and stakeholders to build a support network for immediate project launch upon funding.\r\nDemonstrating Capacity through Strategic Intentions:\r\nWhile GHIF is a nascent organization, our strategic planning reflects a clear and actionable roadmap for immediate impact upon funding. The foundation\u2019s goals are backed by a commitment to leverage the diverse skills of its team and the strategic insights of its board to establish a high-performing organization. GHIF&#x27;s initial actions and detailed project preparations demonstrate our readiness and capability to effectively manage and utilize the grant to achieve significant social impact.\r\nCross-Sector Collaboration \r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to developing localized, high-impact programs that serve as models for global implementation. To achieve this, GHIF emphasizes cross-sector collaboration, mainly focusing on strategic partnerships in Italy and the United States. These collaborations are designed to leverage regional strengths and address specific local needs, ensuring the adaptability and effectiveness of our well-being services.\r\nLocalized Educational Partnerships\r\nGHIF will collaborate with leading educational institutions in Italy and the United States to integrate well-being practices into educational curricula. This initiative will focus on regions with significant disparities in educational outcomes, providing targeted interventions that are culturally and contextually relevant. Research indicates that collaborative learning environments and educational partnerships can significantly enhance student outcomes and well-being (Kilgo et al., 2015). Success in these partnerships will be evaluated based on educational improvements, student well-being metrics, and the scalability of the programs to other regions.\r\nHealthcare Alliances\r\nGHIF plans to partner with healthcare organizations in Italy and the United States to increase access to quality health services. These partnerships will focus on integrating mental health services with primary care, a critical need in both countries, according to local health reports. Studies have shown cross-sector healthcare collaborations can improve health outcomes, particularly when mental health services are integrated with primary care (Randall et al., 2023). By working with local health providers and community organizations, these initiatives aim to create sustainable health improvement models suitable for global replication.\r\nPublic-Private Partnerships\r\nGHIF will seek partnerships with local government bodies and private sectors in Italy and the United States to support infrastructure development vital to program delivery. These partnerships will help facilitate the creation of community wellness centers, which will serve as hubs for education, healthcare, and community activities. Effective public-private partnerships have been shown to significantly enhance community health and well-being (Ovseiko et al., 2014). The effectiveness of these centers will be measured through community engagement rates and the overall improvement in community health and educational outcomes.\r\nCommunity Engagement\r\nIntegral to our strategy is the direct involvement of local communities in Italy and the United States in the planning and implementation phases. GHIF believes that community input is essential to tailoring programs that genuinely reflect and meet local needs. Feedback mechanisms and community advisory boards will be established to monitor the programs\u2019 impacts and guide iterative improvements, as there is evidence proving that community involvement is crucial for the success and sustainability of public health programs (Mattessich &amp; Rausch, 2014).", "title": "GW ASSIGNMENT 1.docx", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "bc8b85e5-fb70-4f8a-87d5-ec399ccf77a5", "request_id": "8885da2c3a7a0e9f-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "bc8b85e5-fb70-4f8a-87d5-ec399ccf77a5", "children": ["9f7ffe28-89b7-4fcc-a84f-d850a8d4d218"]}, "9f7ffe28-89b7-4fcc-a84f-d850a8d4d218": {"id": "9f7ffe28-89b7-4fcc-a84f-d850a8d4d218", "message": {"id": "9f7ffe28-89b7-4fcc-a84f-d850a8d4d218", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716475814.591025, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The assignment appears well-structured and adheres to the instructions provided, covering all the required sections thoroughly. Here is a completion of the sections based on the information you&#x27;ve already developed:\n\n### Program Plan\n\n#### Strategies and Activities\n\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) proposes a multi-faceted approach encompassing healthcare, education, and wellness travel to enhance individual well-being globally. Key strategies include:\n\n1. **Healthcare Access Improvement**: Launch mobile health clinics and telemedicine services to provide accessible and affordable healthcare, especially in underserved areas.\n2. **Educational Programs**: Develop and deliver comprehensive educational programs that focus on well-being, mental health, and life skills, tailored to meet local community needs.\n3. **Wellness Travel Packages**: Create travel experiences that promote mental and physical health through exposure to different cultures and natural environments.\n\nThese activities are designed not only to address the immediate needs but also to empower communities by providing them with tools and knowledge to sustain their well-being.\n\n#### Complementarity of Efforts\n\nThe GHIF&#x27;s initiatives are designed to complement existing local efforts by filling gaps rather than duplicating services. For example, our wellness travel packages will be offered in collaboration with local tourism boards and health organizations to enhance rather than compete with local offerings.\n\n#### Timeline\n\nThe following table outlines the deliverables, associated activities, due dates, and potential challenges:\n\n| Deliverables               | Activities                       | Due Date   | Expected Challenges                 |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------|\n| Launch of Mobile Clinics   | Procurement, Staffing, Training  | Q2 2025    | Regulatory approvals, Staff recruitment |\n| Educational Program Rollout| Curriculum Development, Partnerships | Q3 2025 | Cultural adaptability, Funding      |\n| Wellness Travel Launch     | Package Development, Marketing   | Q1 2026    | Market acceptance, Travel restrictions |\n\nThis timeline is structured to ensure a logical progression of activities, allowing for the scaling of efforts and addressing potential challenges head-on.\n\n### Cross-Sector Collaboration\n\n#### Strategic Partnerships\n\nGHIF will form strategic partnerships across various sectors to leverage expertise and resources. These include collaborations with:\n\n- **Educational Institutions**: To integrate our curriculum and co-develop new learning modules.\n- **Healthcare Organizations**: To facilitate a holistic approach to health, combining physical and mental health services.\n- **Local Governments**: To support infrastructure development and ensure alignment with public health objectives.\n\nThese partnerships are crucial for creating a sustainable and scalable impact, enabling GHIF to reach wider communities effectively.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is poised to make a significant impact on global well-being through its innovative programs and strategic collaborations. Our commitment to enhancing individual happiness and societal health is reflected in our comprehensive approach, which integrates healthcare, education, and wellness travel into a cohesive framework for global improvement. By addressing the needs of underserved populations and complementing existing community efforts, GHIF aims to foster a more joyful and healthy world.\n\nThis concludes the narrative part of your grant proposal as per the instructions.

A content person is a beacon of positivity, capable of enriching their community. When we collectively strive for happiness, we also invest in our well-being and foster a society free from the shackles of discontent. These ideas reflect the vision of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation, where individual happiness is the cornerstone of societal harmony.\r\nAs the renowned author John Donne (2010)  famously proclaimed, \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d This sentiment holds true in our pursuit of societal greatness. Achieving this requires unity and collaboration. However, when an individual is grappling with internal conflicts, such as mental health struggles, physical ailments, and a general decline in well-being, overcoming these challenges alone becomes an insurmountable task. Wellness is not just a personal concern but a societal issue that impacts us all.\r\nIn addition to discussing wellness, it is necessary also to address the role of education. If wellness is the foundation, education is the next step, where individuals acquire the necessary skills to lead purposeful, dignified, and joyful lives. Nobody is inherently equipped with the knowledge to improve their surroundings; it must be learned. Therefore, education holds equal significance in the pursuit of wellness. As one begins to grasp the world&#x27;s order, concepts like the principles of space and time, the philosophies of Aristotle, the mathematics of our universe, and the evocative poetry of Yates, one starts to perceive the world in a new, nuanced way. Therefore, to truly understand oneself, it is sometimes necessary to first understand one&#x27;s environment. Thus, in parallel with well-being, education holds great importance.\r\nAs individuals gain knowledge about the world around them, they instinctively desire to explore it further, engaging with it through the senses of touch, taste, and sight. Rather than solely studying Mozart and reading musical notations, experiencing the music in person is essential. Therefore, travel is an invaluable gateway to becoming a well-rounded individual capable of positively contributing to society.\r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to contributing to the creation of a better world. By leveraging the support of donor investors, the foundation aims to empower individuals to pursue their own happiness by providing necessary tools. Our efforts involve establishing partnerships with local government bodies and healthcare providers to ensure easy access to government services and healthcare, as well as working to make travel accessible to all who desire it. These initiatives will lay the foundation for our long-term vision of a globally interconnected and joyful society.\r\nPurpose\r\nThe primary purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally through increased access to essential life-enhancing services. The Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to providing the necessary tools for individuals to pursue their happiness. Our starting point is ensuring access to healthcare and mental health services as a fundamental human right and a crucial component in our efforts to build a better world. We also aim to utilize well-being travel, cultural immersion, and education resources to empower individuals to gain self-awareness, understand others, and collectively achieve holistic happiness.\r\nGoals\r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to enhancing the global quality of life through two strategic goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong-term Goal: Increase Access to Key Well-being Services\r\nOur long-term goal is to significantly increase access to key well-being services globally, with our efforts first being localized in the United States and Italy. By doing so, we aim to improve the quality of life and foster sustained happiness in diverse communities. This goal will be pursued by developing scalable programs that provide essential services such as healthcare, education, and mental wellness. Research indicates that access to healthcare services positively impacts health-related quality of life, particularly among vulnerable populations (Cunningham et al., 1998). Improved access to care has been shown to enhance physical and mental health outcomes, highlighting the importance of such initiatives (Gu et al., 2009). The impact of these programs will be measured by tracking the number of individuals accessing these services, the improvement in health and education outcomes, and overall satisfaction rates among participants, reflecting the direct benefits of our initiatives.\r\nShort-term Goal: Establish and Strengthen Partnerships\r\nSimultaneously, our short-term goal is to establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international public and private organizations. These partnerships are crucial for enhancing our capability to deliver critical services effectively and efficiently. By collaborating with organizations with established infrastructures and expertise in our target regions, we can leverage their strengths to better serve the communities&#x27; needs. Formalizing at least five significant partnerships within the first six months will be vital to achieving this goal. Effective partnerships have been shown to improve service delivery and accessibility, leading to better health outcomes (Seid et al., 2006). These partnerships will be evaluated based on the operational synergy achieved and the speed at which services are deployed to the beneficiaries.\r\nBoth goals complement existing efforts in the target communities rather than duplicate them, ensuring that our interventions add value and create a measurable impact. Through these focused efforts, the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation seeks to build a foundation for long-term social change that contributes to the well-being of individuals worldwide.\r\nObjectives\r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) has set ambitious yet achievable objectives to ensure a broad and lasting impact on global well-being.\r\nEducational Expansion\r\nOur first objective focuses on education expansion. Within the first year, GHIF plans to launch educational programs in at least two countries, aiming to reach over 5000 individuals. These programs will be developed to address local educational gaps, better equip youths with functional skills,  and promote holistic learning experiences. Evidence shows that educational programs can significantly enhance psychological well-being by increasing self-efficacy, social support, and overall life satisfaction (Ross &amp; Willigen, 1997). Moreover, education has been linked to improved health outcomes and better mental health, with increased years of education correlating with lower rates of depression and anxiety (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder, 2022). The success of these programs will be measured by the number of programs successfully launched, the total number of participants enrolled, and participant feedback on program effectiveness.\r\nHealthcare Partnerships\r\nSimultaneously, GHIF aims to establish healthcare partnerships to enhance access to medical and mental health services. By the end of the first six months, we will secure partnerships with at least five major healthcare providers. These collaborations will focus on providing comprehensive health services emphasizing preventive care and mental health, which are crucial for improving individual well-being. Studies have shown that partnerships between educational institutions and healthcare providers can significantly improve health outcomes, particularly in preventive care and mental health services (Ross &amp; Wu, 1995). The effectiveness of these partnerships will be assessed through the number of agreements signed, the range of services provided, and feedback from service users regarding the accessibility and quality of care.\r\nWellness Travel Model\r\nLastly, our third objective is to develop a wellness travel model, which will be designed, developed, and ready for implementation within the first eighteen months. This model will provide frameworks for wellness-oriented travel experiences, promoting mental and physical health benefits through carefully crafted travel packages. Wellness programs embedded in educational and travel contexts have shown positive impacts on well-being, reducing stress and improving mental health (Young et al., 2020). The model\u2019s success will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction measured through surveys and the repeat engagement rate, indicating the model&#x27;s appeal and effectiveness in enhancing participants&#x27; well-being.\r\nOrganizational Capacity\r\nFoundation Structure and Management Capability:\r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is designed to be a robust organization capable of managing large-scale projects and substantial grants. At its inception, GHIF will establish a governance structure with a board of directors comprising education, healthcare, mental health, and non-profit management experts. This board will provide strategic oversight and ensure all activities align with our mission and objectives.\r\nFounding Team Expertise:\r\nThe founding team of GHIF will include highly qualified professionals selected for their extensive experience in project management, international development, healthcare, and educational programming. Our recruitment strategy focuses on identifying individuals with a proven track record, such as a Project Director with significant experience in managing and scaling community health programs, an Education Specialist renowned for developing effective curricula in diverse cultural settings, and a Mental Health Advocate with a strong background in leading global mental wellness initiatives. This planned assembly of expertise ensures a comprehensive and skilled approach to achieving the foundation\u2019s objectives.\r\nProject Management Systems:\r\nGHIF will implement rigorous project management methodologies to oversee all foundation activities. We will utilize established frameworks such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guidelines to plan, execute, monitor, and close projects. Additionally, GHIF will adopt modern project management tools for real-time tracking and reporting, facilitating transparent and efficient management of the grant funds.\r\nPreparatory Actions for Grant Management:\r\nPrior to receiving the grant, GHIF will:\r\n1. Formulate detailed project plans, including timelines, budgets, and resource allocation.\r\n2. Establish financial management policies tailored to ensure accountability and prudent use of funds.\r\n3. Initiate discussions with potential partners and stakeholders to build a support network for immediate project launch upon funding.\r\nDemonstrating Capacity through Strategic Intentions:\r\nWhile GHIF is a nascent organization, our strategic planning reflects a clear and actionable roadmap for immediate impact upon funding. The foundation\u2019s goals are backed by a commitment to leverage the diverse skills of its team and the strategic insights of its board to establish a high-performing organization. GHIF&#x27;s initial actions and detailed project preparations demonstrate our readiness and capability to effectively manage and utilize the grant to achieve significant social impact.\r\nCross-Sector Collaboration \r\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to developing localized, high-impact programs that serve as models for global implementation. To achieve this, GHIF emphasizes cross-sector collaboration, mainly focusing on strategic partnerships in Italy and the United States. These collaborations are designed to leverage regional strengths and address specific local needs, ensuring the adaptability and effectiveness of our well-being services.\r\nLocalized Educational Partnerships\r\nGHIF will collaborate with leading educational institutions in Italy and the United States to integrate well-being practices into educational curricula. This initiative will focus on regions with significant disparities in educational outcomes, providing targeted interventions that are culturally and contextually relevant. Research indicates that collaborative learning environments and educational partnerships can significantly enhance student outcomes and well-being (Kilgo et al., 2015). Success in these partnerships will be evaluated based on educational improvements, student well-being metrics, and the scalability of the programs to other regions.\r\nHealthcare Alliances\r\nGHIF plans to partner with healthcare organizations in Italy and the United States to increase access to quality health services. These partnerships will focus on integrating mental health services with primary care, a critical need in both countries, according to local health reports. Studies have shown cross-sector healthcare collaborations can improve health outcomes, particularly when mental health services are integrated with primary care (Randall et al., 2023). By working with local health providers and community organizations, these initiatives aim to create sustainable health improvement models suitable for global replication.\r\nPublic-Private Partnerships\r\nGHIF will seek partnerships with local government bodies and private sectors in Italy and the United States to support infrastructure development vital to program delivery. These partnerships will help facilitate the creation of community wellness centers, which will serve as hubs for education, healthcare, and community activities. Effective public-private partnerships have been shown to significantly enhance community health and well-being (Ovseiko et al., 2014). The effectiveness of these centers will be measured through community engagement rates and the overall improvement in community health and educational outcomes.\r\nCommunity Engagement\r\nIntegral to our strategy is the direct involvement of local communities in Italy and the United States in the planning and implementation phases. GHIF believes that community input is essential to tailoring programs that genuinely reflect and meet local needs. Feedback mechanisms and community advisory boards will be established to monitor the programs\u2019 impacts and guide iterative improvements, as there is evidence proving that community involvement is crucial for the success and sustainability of public health programs (Mattessich &amp; Rausch, 2014).", "title": "GW ASSIGNMENT 1.docx", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "4e1345d7-da40-446a-b96b-d138c968a0b7", "request_id": "88860b050c2a0e01-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4e1345d7-da40-446a-b96b-d138c968a0b7", "children": ["a81dee49-66b0-4734-b9e2-0b741dcbce7e"]}, "a81dee49-66b0-4734-b9e2-0b741dcbce7e": {"id": "a81dee49-66b0-4734-b9e2-0b741dcbce7e", "message": {"id": "a81dee49-66b0-4734-b9e2-0b741dcbce7e", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716477826.451892, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Here\u2019s a detailed **Program Plan** section based on the initiatives and strategies you outlined, focusing on government and healthcare services integration, wellness travel, and holistic education.

Here is the revised section:\n\n---\n\n### Program Plan\n\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to enhancing the well-being and happiness of individuals globally through strategic interventions designed to complement, rather than duplicate, existing efforts in the communities we target, primarily in the United States and Italy.\n\n**Integration with Government and Healthcare Services:**\nGHIF&#x27;s approach includes a robust collaboration with government bodies and healthcare providers to ensure seamless access to necessary services. By establishing partnerships with these entities, GHIF intends to facilitate connections that streamline the process for individuals to receive both governmental support and healthcare. This initiative will involve setting up efficient referral systems, advocating for patient rights, and ensuring that these services are both accessible and respectful of the needs of diverse populations. Training for community health workers will be pivotal, as they will assist individuals in navigating these systems, aiming to enhance overall health outcomes and patient satisfaction with the services received.\n\n**Wellness Travel Model:**\nSimultaneously, GHIF will introduce a Wellness Travel Model, which integrates travel with health and educational benefits, thereby promoting both mental and physical well-being. This model will offer travel packages that include wellness activities, cultural immersion, and educational workshops, designed in partnership with local travel agencies and communities to ensure inclusivity and accessibility. The aim is to foster a broader understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures, improve mental health, and enhance the participants&#x27; sense of well-being through enriching travel experiences that go beyond traditional tourism.\n\n**Holistic Educational Access:**\nFurthermore, GHIF plans to revolutionize educational access by incorporating practical life skills alongside traditional academic learning. New curricula will be developed to include training in essential skills like cooking and electronics, which will be integrated into the educational systems through partnerships with local schools and institutions. This educational expansion will not only address the functional skills gap but also enhance emotional intelligence and prepare students and community members for a more successful and satisfying life. Public workshops and lifelong learning seminars will also be rolled out to extend these educational benefits to the broader community.\n\n**Timeline and Evaluation:**\nThe timeline for these initiatives is strategically set to ensure a phased implementation:\n- By the end of the second quarter of 2025, GHIF will establish the initial partnerships necessary for the referral systems and start the development of training programs for community health workers.\n- The Wellness Travel Packages are expected to be launched by the third quarter of 2025, following the establishment of partnerships early in the same year.\n- Educational program rollouts are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024, with full implementation across targeted regions by the second quarter of 2025.\n\nEach element of the program plan is designed to measure specific outcomes related to access, satisfaction, and educational attainment, ensuring that GHIF&#x27;s interventions create measurable and sustainable impacts in the communities served. This strategic planning demonstrates GHIF&#x27;s capability to manage a large grant effectively and fulfill its mission of building a foundation for long-term social change that contributes significantly to global well-being.\n\n---\n\nThis narrative format provides a seamless flow of information that highlights how GHIF&#x27;s strategies and activities are directly aligned with its goals and the specific needs of the communities it aims to serve, ensuring adherence to the guidelines specified in the assignment instructions."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

A content person is a beacon of positivity capable of enriching their community. When we collectively strive for happiness we also invest in our well-being and foster a society free from the shackles of discontent. These ideas reflect the vision of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation where individual happiness is the cornerstone of societal harmony.\nAs the renowned author John Donne (2010)  famously proclaimed \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d This sentiment holds true in our pursuit of societal greatness. Achieving this requires unity and collaboration. However when an individual is grappling with internal conflicts such as mental health struggles physical ailments and a general decline in well-being overcoming these challenges alone becomes an insurmountable task. Wellness is not just a personal concern but a societal issue that impacts us all.\nIn addition to discussing wellness it is necessary also to address the role of education. If wellness is the foundation education is the next step where individuals acquire the necessary skills to lead purposeful dignified and joyful lives. Nobody is inherently equipped with the knowledge to improve their surroundings; it must be learned. Therefore education holds equal significance in the pursuit of wellness. As one begins to grasp the world&#x27;s order concepts like the principles of space and time the philosophies of Aristotle the mathematics of our universe and the evocative poetry of Yates one starts to perceive the world in a new nuanced way. Therefore to truly understand oneself it is sometimes necessary to first understand one&#x27;s environment. Thus in parallel with well-being education holds great importance.\nAs individuals gain knowledge about the world around them they instinctively desire to explore it further engaging with it through the senses of touch taste and sight. Rather than solely studying Mozart and reading musical notations experiencing the music in person is essential. Therefore travel is an invaluable gateway to becoming a well-rounded individual capable of positively contributing to society.\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to contributing to the creation of a better world. By leveraging the support of donor investors the foundation aims to empower individuals to pursue their own happiness by providing necessary tools. Our efforts involve establishing partnerships with local government bodies and healthcare providers to ensure easy access to government services and healthcare as well as working to make travel accessible to all who desire it. These initiatives will lay the foundation for our long-term vision of a globally interconnected and joyful society.\nPurpose\nThe primary purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally through increased access to essential life-enhancing services. The Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to providing the necessary tools for individuals to pursue their happiness. Our starting point is ensuring access to healthcare and mental health services as a fundamental human right and a crucial component in our efforts to build a better world. We also aim to utilize well-being travel cultural immersion and education resources to empower individuals to gain self-awareness understand others and collectively achieve holistic happiness.\nGoals\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to enhancing the global quality of life through two strategic goals.\n\nLong-term Goal: Increase Access to Key Well-being Services\nOur long-term goal is to significantly increase access to key well-being services globally with our efforts first being localized in the United States and Italy. By doing so we aim to improve the quality of life and foster sustained happiness in diverse communities. This goal will be pursued by developing scalable programs that provide essential services such as healthcare education and mental wellness. Research indicates that access to healthcare services positively impacts health-related quality of life particularly among vulnerable populations (Cunningham et al. 1998). Improved access to care has been shown to enhance physical and mental health outcomes highlighting the importance of such initiatives (Gu et al. 2009). The impact of these programs will be measured by tracking the number of individuals accessing these services the improvement in health and education outcomes and overall satisfaction rates among participants reflecting the direct benefits of our initiatives.\nShort-term Goal: Establish and Strengthen Partnerships\nSimultaneously our short-term goal is to establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international public and private organizations. These partnerships are crucial for enhancing our capability to deliver critical services effectively and efficiently. By collaborating with organizations with established infrastructures and expertise in our target regions we can leverage their strengths to better serve the communities&#x27; needs. Formalizing at least five significant partnerships within the first six months will be vital to achieving this goal. Effective partnerships have been shown to improve service delivery and accessibility leading to better health outcomes (Seid et al. 2006). These partnerships will be evaluated based on the operational synergy achieved and the speed at which services are deployed to the beneficiaries.\nBoth goals complement existing efforts in the target communities rather than duplicate them ensuring that our interventions add value and create a measurable impact. Through these focused efforts the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation seeks to build a foundation for long-term social change that contributes to the well-being of individuals worldwide.\nObjectives\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) has set ambitious yet achievable objectives to ensure a broad and lasting impact on global well-being.\nEducational Expansion\nOur first objective focuses on education expansion. Within the first year GHIF plans to launch educational programs in at least two countries aiming to reach over 5000 individuals. These programs will be developed to address local educational gaps better equip youths with functional skills  and promote holistic learning experiences. Evidence shows that educational programs can significantly enhance psychological well-being by increasing self-efficacy social support and overall life satisfaction (Ross &amp; Willigen 1997). Moreover education has been linked to improved health outcomes and better mental health with increased years of education correlating with lower rates of depression and anxiety (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder 2022). The success of these programs will be measured by the number of programs successfully launched the total number of participants enrolled and participant feedback on program effectiveness.\nHealthcare Partnerships\nSimultaneously GHIF aims to establish healthcare partnerships to enhance access to medical and mental health services. By the end of the first six months we will secure partnerships with at least five major healthcare providers. These collaborations will focus on providing comprehensive health services emphasizing preventive care and mental health which are crucial for improving individual well-being. Studies have shown that partnerships between educational institutions and healthcare providers can significantly improve health outcomes particularly in preventive care and mental health services (Ross &amp; Wu 1995). The effectiveness of these partnerships will be assessed through the number of agreements signed the range of services provided and feedback from service users regarding the accessibility and quality of care.\nWellness Travel Model\nLastly our third objective is to develop a wellness travel model which will be designed developed and ready for implementation within the first eighteen months. This model will provide frameworks for wellness-oriented travel experiences promoting mental and physical health benefits through carefully crafted travel packages. Wellness programs embedded in educational and travel contexts have shown positive impacts on well-being reducing stress and improving mental health (Young et al. 2020). The model\u2019s success will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction measured through surveys and the repeat engagement rate indicating the model&#x27;s appeal and effectiveness in enhancing participants&#x27; well-being.\nOrganizational Capacity\nFoundation Structure and Management Capability:\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is designed to be a robust organization capable of managing large-scale projects and substantial grants. At its inception GHIF will establish a governance structure with a board of directors comprising education healthcare mental health and non-profit management experts. This board will provide strategic oversight and ensure all activities align with our mission and objectives.\nFounding Team Expertise:\nThe founding team of GHIF will include highly qualified professionals selected for their extensive experience in project management international development healthcare and educational programming. Our recruitment strategy focuses on identifying individuals with a proven track record such as a Project Director with significant experience in managing and scaling community health programs an Education Specialist renowned for developing effective curricula in diverse cultural settings and a Mental Health Advocate with a strong background in leading global mental wellness initiatives. This planned assembly of expertise ensures a comprehensive and skilled approach to achieving the foundation\u2019s objectives.\nProject Management Systems:\nGHIF will implement rigorous project management methodologies to oversee all foundation activities. We will utilize established frameworks such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guidelines to plan execute monitor and close projects. Additionally GHIF will adopt modern project management tools for real-time tracking and reporting facilitating transparent and efficient management of the grant funds.\nPreparatory Actions for Grant Management:\nPrior to receiving the grant GHIF will:\nFormulate detailed project plans including timelines budgets and resource allocation.\nEstablish financial management policies tailored to ensure accountability and prudent use of funds.\nInitiate discussions with potential partners and stakeholders to build a support network for immediate project launch upon funding.\nDemonstrating Capacity through Strategic Intentions:\nWhile GHIF is a nascent organization our strategic planning reflects a clear and actionable roadmap for immediate impact upon funding. The foundation\u2019s goals are backed by a commitment to leverage the diverse skills of its team and the strategic insights of its board to establish a high-performing organization. GHIF&#x27;s initial actions and detailed project preparations demonstrate our readiness and capability to effectively manage and utilize the grant to achieve significant social impact.\nCross-Sector Collaboration \nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to developing localized high-impact programs that serve as models for global implementation. To achieve this GHIF emphasizes cross-sector collaboration mainly focusing on strategic partnerships in Italy and the United States. These collaborations are designed to leverage regional strengths and address specific local needs ensuring the adaptability and effectiveness of our well-being services.\nLocalized Educational Partnerships\nGHIF will collaborate with leading educational institutions in Italy and the United States to integrate well-being practices into educational curricula. This initiative will focus on regions with significant disparities in educational outcomes providing targeted interventions that are culturally and contextually relevant. Research indicates that collaborative learning environments and educational partnerships can significantly enhance student outcomes and well-being (Kilgo et al. 2015). Success in these partnerships will be evaluated based on educational improvements student well-being metrics and the scalability of the programs to other regions.\nHealthcare Alliances\nGHIF plans to partner with healthcare organizations in Italy and the United States to increase access to quality health services. These partnerships will focus on integrating mental health services with primary care a critical need in both countries according to local health reports. Studies have shown cross-sector healthcare collaborations can improve health outcomes particularly when mental health services are integrated with primary care (Randall et al. 2023). By working with local health providers and community organizations these initiatives aim to create sustainable health improvement models suitable for global replication.\nPublic-Private Partnerships\nGHIF will seek partnerships with local government bodies and private sectors in Italy and the United States to support infrastructure development vital to program delivery. These partnerships will help facilitate the creation of community wellness centers which will serve as hubs for education healthcare and community activities. Effective public-private partnerships have been shown to significantly enhance community health and well-being (Ovseiko et al. 2014). The effectiveness of these centers will be measured through community engagement rates and the overall improvement in community health and educational outcomes.\nCommunity Engagement\nIntegral to our strategy is the direct involvement of local communities in Italy and the United States in the planning and implementation phases. GHIF believes that community input is essential to tailoring programs that genuinely reflect and meet local needs. Feedback mechanisms and community advisory boards will be established to monitor the programs\u2019 impacts and guide iterative improvements as there is evidence proving that community involvement is crucial for the success and sustainability of public health programs (Mattessich &amp; Rausch 2014).\nProgram Plan\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to enhancing the well-being and happiness of individuals globally through strategic interventions designed to complement rather than duplicate existing efforts in the communities we target primarily in the United States and Italy.\nIntegration with Government and Healthcare Services\nGHIF&#x27;s approach includes a robust collaboration with government bodies and healthcare providers to ensure seamless access to necessary services. By establishing partnerships with these entities GHIF intends to facilitate connections that streamline the process for individuals to receive both governmental support and healthcare. This initiative will involve setting up efficient referral systems advocating for patient rights and ensuring that these services are both accessible and respectful of the needs of diverse populations. Training for community health workers will be pivotal as they will assist individuals in navigating these systems aiming to enhance overall health outcomes and patient satisfaction with the services received.\nWellness Travel Model\nSimultaneously GHIF will introduce a Wellness Travel Model which integrates travel with health and educational benefits thereby promoting both mental and physical well-being. This model will offer travel packages that include wellness activities cultural immersion and educational workshops designed in partnership with local travel agencies and communities to ensure inclusivity and accessibility. The aim is to foster a broader understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures improve mental health and enhance the participants&#x27; sense of well-being through enriching travel experiences that go beyond traditional tourism.\n\nHolistic Educational Access\nFurthermore GHIF is dedicated to transforming educational access by not only equipping individuals with essential technological skills but also by enriching their lives through the arts. Our comprehensive educational strategy includes hands-on training in critical modern technologies like 3D printing and robotics alongside programs in digital literacy that prepare community members for the technological demands of today and tomorrow. In addition to these technical skills GHIF will integrate arts education\u2014spanning music visual arts and literature\u2014into the curriculum. This approach ensures a well-rounded education that helps individuals understand the world find personal fulfillment and develop a capacity for creativity and innovation that is just as vital as practical skills.\nBy collaborating with local schools and educational institutions we aim to bridge existing skills gaps and foster environments where students and community members not only acquire necessary technical expertise but also explore and develop their artistic talents. This balanced educational approach supports individuals in finding their place in the world contributing positively to society and achieving personal happiness. To extend these opportunities GHIF will also host public workshops and lifelong learning seminars that offer both practical skills training and artistic enrichment ensuring all community members have the resources to thrive and adapt in a multifaceted global landscape.\nTimeline and Evaluation\nThe timeline for these initiatives is strategically set to ensure a phased implementation. By the end of the second quarter of 2025 GHIF will establish the initial partnerships necessary for the referral systems and start developing training programs for community health workers. Following the establishment of partnerships early in the same year the Wellness Travel Packages are expected to be launched by the third quarter of 2025. Educational program rollouts are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024 and be fully implemented across targeted regions by the second quarter of 2025.\nEach element of the program plan is designed to measure specific outcomes related to access satisfaction and educational attainment ensuring that GHIF&#x27;s interventions create measurable and sustainable impacts in the communities served. This strategic planning demonstrates GHIF&#x27;s capability to manage a large grant effectively and fulfill its mission of building a foundation for long-term social change that contributes significantly to global well-being.\n\n\n\t\nDeliverables\t\nActivities\t\nDue Date\t\nExpected Challenges\n\t\nSet up Referral Systems\t\nEstablish partnerships develop training for staff\t\nQ2 2025\t\nRegulatory hurdles securing partner cooperation\n\t\nLaunch Wellness Travel Packages\t\nDesign packages negotiate with travel agencies\t\nQ3 2025\t\nLogistics coordination ensuring accessibility and inclusion\n\t\nRollout Educational Programs\t\nDevelop curricula integrate into schools\t\nQ4 2025\t\nAdaptation to local educational standards funding\n\t\nPublic Workshops and Seminars\t\nPlan and implement workshops and lifelong learning seminars\t\nQ1 2026\t\nCommunity engagement sustaining interest over time", "title": "GW ASSIGNMENT 1.docx", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa26156-8a2e-4919-9b0b-e03b4e588871", "request_id": "8886381b0811babb-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa26156-8a2e-4919-9b0b-e03b4e588871", "children": ["9fcc68c4-bb9b-48d7-a7ab-8e77f28a5052"]}, "9fcc68c4-bb9b-48d7-a7ab-8e77f28a5052": {"id": "9fcc68c4-bb9b-48d7-a7ab-8e77f28a5052", "message": {"id": "9fcc68c4-bb9b-48d7-a7ab-8e77f28a5052", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716479676.3364, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Your Program Plan section closely aligns with the assignment instructions, particularly in terms of detailing the proposed strategies, activities, interventions, and the accompanying timeline. However, there are a few areas that could be refined to better match the criteria specified in the instructions:\n\n1. **Addressing and Developing Needs**: The plan does a good job outlining how your strategies and activities will be implemented, but you might want to emphasize more explicitly how these initiatives are specifically designed to address and develop areas of need within the community. This could involve a clearer link between community needs assessments and the strategies chosen.\n\n2. **Avoiding Duplication**: The instructions specifically ask for a demonstration of how your interventions complement, rather than duplicate, similar efforts underway in the target communities.

Our approach is tailored to leverage local strengths and engage deeply with community-specific challenges, deploying innovative, sustainable solutions to enhance health and happiness without duplicating efforts.\n\n**Integration with Government and Healthcare Services**\n\nThis initiative seeks to close significant gaps in healthcare and government service accessibility, identified through comprehensive community outreach and stakeholder consultations. GHIF will develop strategic partnerships with local health departments and social service agencies to streamline access to essential services through an integrated referral network. Alongside this, we will engage in advocacy and policy development to enhance service delivery tailored to the needs of underrepresented communities. Furthermore, we aim to bolster our impact by deploying specialized training programs for community health workers, enhancing their ability to navigate complex healthcare systems and provide empathetic support to individuals in need. The expected outcomes include not only improved health metrics but also a strengthened trust between communities and healthcare providers.\n\n**Wellness Travel Model**\n\nRecognizing the underutilized therapeutic potential of travel, GHIF plans to introduce a Wellness Travel Model that combines health benefits with cultural and educational experiences. In collaboration with travel experts and cultural institutions, we will design travel packages that include activities such as guided meditations, wellness workshops, and cultural tours. These packages will be developed in close consultation with local communities to ensure cultural respect and mutual enrichment. The anticipated impacts of this model include a broadened cultural appreciation among participants, enhanced mental wellness, and direct economic benefits to the host communities through sustainable tourism practices.\n\n**Holistic Educational Access**\n\nGHIF is also set to transform educational access by integrating a curriculum that includes both advanced technology training\u2014such as coding and robotics\u2014and comprehensive arts education encompassing visual arts and music. This initiative will see the development and integration of these curricula into existing educational structures within schools and community learning centers. To complement this, GHIF will establish ongoing learning opportunities through workshops and seminars designed for all age groups, promoting lifelong skill development and personal growth. This dual focus on technological proficiency and artistic expression aims to enhance employability, foster creativity, and improve educational outcomes across the board.\n\n**Timeline and Evaluation**\n\nThe implementation of these programs is structured around a detailed timeline with specific milestones:\n\n| **Deliverables**                       | **Activities**                                  | **Due Date**  | **Expected Challenges**                               |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Setup of Referral Systems**         | Partnership development, training programs      | Q2 2025       | Navigating regulatory environments, partnership alignment |\n| **Launch of Wellness Travel Packages**| Travel package design, community engagement     | Q3 2025       | Coordination logistics, ensuring cultural sensitivity |\n| **Rollout of Educational Programs**   | Curriculum development, integration into schools| Q4 2025       | Securing funding, adapting programs to local needs   |\n| **Public Workshops and Seminars**     | Planning and implementation                     | Q1 2026       | Sustaining community interest and engagement         |\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy strategically aligning our interventions with community needs and building on existing programs, GHIF is poised to significantly enhance global well-being and happiness. Our detailed, phased approach ensures that all programs are seamlessly integrated into the community fabric, supported by robust partnerships, and continuously evaluated for their effectiveness and adaptability.\n\n---\n\nThis narrative format ties the initiatives together in a fluid, cohesive manner, providing a comprehensive view of the program while maintaining the informative depth required for a detailed grant proposal."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

We implement multifaceted strategies that enhance individual well-being and community health, specifically designed to complement, rather than duplicate, existing services. Our comprehensive approach leverages local strengths and targets specific challenges through innovative and sustainable solutions.\n\n**Integration with Government and Healthcare Services**\nOur initiative targets significant gaps in access to healthcare and government support services. These gaps have been identified through extensive community outreach and stakeholder engagement, underscoring a pressing need for improved service accessibility and quality. To address these challenges, GHIF plans to forge strategic alliances with local health departments and social service agencies, creating a referral network that simplifies the process for individuals to access the services they need. This network aims to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of health and social care systems.\n\nPartnership development is crucial for the success of our healthcare integration strategy. By collaborating with local health authorities and service providers, we aim to establish robust partnerships that facilitate streamlined access to healthcare and support services. These partnerships will be foundational in building a comprehensive referral system that enhances service delivery and meets the specific needs of the communities we serve.\n\nIn addition to building partnerships, GHIF will engage in advocacy and policy work to enhance healthcare delivery. We will work closely with policymakers to advocate for regulations and policies that prioritize the health and well-being of underrepresented communities. Our focus on advocacy aims to influence policy changes that improve healthcare accessibility and address systemic barriers in service delivery.\n\nTraining community health workers is another key component of our strategy. GHIF will implement comprehensive training programs designed to enhance the capabilities of health workers in assisting individuals effectively. These programs will focus on developing empathy, technical skills, and a deep understanding of the healthcare system, ensuring that community health workers are well-equipped to support individuals in navigating health and social services.\n\n**Wellness Travel Model**\nGHIF recognizes the therapeutic potential of travel in promoting mental and physical well-being. To harness this potential, we are developing a Wellness Travel Model that integrates health benefits with cultural and educational experiences. This innovative approach to wellness extends beyond traditional health settings and includes travel packages that feature guided meditations, wellness workshops, and cultural tours. Each package is designed in collaboration with travel experts and cultural institutions to ensure that they offer genuine health benefits and facilitate cultural appreciation.\n\nCommunity-based involvement is integral to the design and execution of our Wellness Travel Model. We engage local communities in the development of travel experiences to ensure that they are culturally respectful and enriching for both visitors and hosts. This engagement helps to create authentic travel experiences that are sensitive to the cultural dynamics of the host communities and provide meaningful interactions that benefit all participants.\n\n**Holistic Educational Access**\nGHIF is also dedicated to transforming educational access by integrating a curriculum that includes both advanced technology training and comprehensive arts education. This holistic approach aims to bridge the gap in technological and creative skills, preparing individuals for the demands of the modern workforce and personal development. Our curriculum includes training in coding, robotics, visual arts, and music, and is designed to be integrated into school systems and community learning centers.\n\nTo complement our formal education initiatives, GHIF will establish ongoing learning opportunities through workshops and seminars that are open to all age groups. These initiatives focus on continuous skill development and personal growth, promoting lifelong learning and adaptability. By offering workshops and seminars that cover a range of skills and artistic disciplines, we aim to foster an environment of continuous learning and creative exploration.\n\n**Timeline and Evaluation**\n\nTo ensure the effective implementation of these strategies, GHIF has established a detailed timeline with clear milestones:\n- **Q2 2025**: Complete the setup of referral systems, including partnership development and staff training.\n- **Q3 2025**: Launch the Wellness Travel Packages after extensive collaboration with travel agencies and community consultations.\n- **Q4 2025**: Begin the rollout of educational programs, integrating our newly developed curricula into schools and community centers.\n- **Q1 2026**: Initiate public workshops and seminars, focusing on sustaining community interest and engagement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThrough strategic interventions aligned with identified community needs and existing programs, GHIF is poised to make a significant and sustainable impact on global well-being and happiness. Our detailed plan ensures that all programs are seamlessly integrated into community structures, supported by robust partnerships, and continuously evaluated for effectiveness and adaptability.\n\n---\n\nThis narrative version transforms the plan into a flowing, cohesive text that aligns with the expected narrative structure of academic and professional documents, emphasizing a detailed and integrated approach to program implementation."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The red and green hues are particularly striking and add a nice touch to the overall aesthetic.\n\n2. **Design Elements**: The combination of the cow and flowers is unique and seems to tell a personal story or symbolize something meaningful to you. The positioning and flow of the elements look well-balanced.\n\n3. **Line Work**: The lines seem to be well-defined, though some areas appear a bit faded. This could be due to natural wear over time, and a touch-up might help rejuvenate the colors and sharpness.\n\n4. **Placement**: The tattoo&#x27;s placement on the shoulder looks great, as it provides a nice canvas for the design and allows for good visibility.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a beautiful and distinctive tattoo with a lot of character.

A content person is a beacon of positivity capable of enriching their community. When we collectively strive for happiness we also invest in our well-being and foster a society free from the shackles of discontent. These ideas reflect the vision of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation where individual happiness is the cornerstone of societal harmony.\nAs the renowned author John Donne (2010)  famously proclaimed \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d This sentiment holds true in our pursuit of societal greatness. Achieving this requires unity and collaboration. However when an individual is grappling with internal conflicts such as mental health struggles physical ailments and a general decline in well-being overcoming these challenges alone becomes an insurmountable task. Wellness is not just a personal concern but a societal issue that impacts us all.\nIn addition to discussing wellness it is necessary also to address the role of education. If wellness is the foundation education is the next step where individuals acquire the necessary skills to lead purposeful dignified and joyful lives. Nobody is inherently equipped with the knowledge to improve their surroundings; it must be learned. Therefore education holds equal significance in the pursuit of wellness. As one begins to grasp the world&#x27;s order concepts like the principles of space and time the philosophies of Aristotle the mathematics of our universe and the evocative poetry of Yates one starts to perceive the world in a new nuanced way. Therefore to truly understand oneself it is sometimes necessary to first understand one&#x27;s environment. Thus in parallel with well-being education holds great importance.\nAs individuals gain knowledge about the world around them they instinctively desire to explore it further engaging with it through the senses of touch taste and sight. Rather than solely studying Mozart and reading musical notations experiencing the music in person is essential. Therefore travel is an invaluable gateway to becoming a well-rounded individual capable of positively contributing to society.\nWith these considerations in mind the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation aspires to contribute to creating a better world. The foundation aims to utilize the contributions from donor investors to foster a happier world by empowering individuals to pursue their own happiness through the provision of necessary tools. Our efforts here will establish the groundwork for our long-term vision of a globally interconnected and joyful society.\nPurpose\nThe primary purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally through increased access to essential life-enhancing services. The Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to providing the necessary tools for individuals to pursue their happiness. Our starting point is ensuring access to healthcare and mental health services as a fundamental human right and a crucial component in our efforts to build a better world. We also aim to utilize well-being travel cultural immersion and education resources to empower individuals to gain self-awareness understand others and collectively achieve holistic happiness.\nGoals\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to enhancing the global quality of life through two strategic goals.\n\nLong-term Goal: Increase Access to Key Well-being Services\nOur long-term goal is to significantly increase access to key well-being services globally with our efforts first being localized in the United States and Italy. By doing so we aim to improve the quality of life and foster sustained happiness in diverse communities. This goal will be pursued by developing scalable programs that provide essential services such as healthcare education and mental wellness. Research indicates that access to healthcare services positively impacts health-related quality of life particularly among vulnerable populations (Cunningham et al. 1998). Improved access to care has been shown to enhance physical and mental health outcomes highlighting the importance of such initiatives (Gu et al. 2009). The impact of these programs will be measured by tracking the number of individuals accessing these services the improvement in health and education outcomes and overall satisfaction rates among participants reflecting the direct benefits of our initiatives.\nShort-term Goal: Establish and Strengthen Partnerships\nSimultaneously our short-term goal is to establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international organizations. These partnerships are crucial for enhancing our capability to deliver critical services effectively and efficiently. By collaborating with organizations with established infrastructures and expertise in our target regions we can leverage their strengths to better serve the communities&#x27; needs. Formalizing at least five significant partnerships within the first six months will be vital to achieving this goal. Effective partnerships have been shown to improve service delivery and accessibility leading to better health outcomes (Seid et al. 2006). These partnerships will be evaluated based on the operational synergy achieved and the speed at which services are deployed to the beneficiaries.\nBoth goals complement existing efforts in the target communities rather than duplicate them ensuring that our interventions add value and create a measurable impact. Through these focused efforts the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation seeks to build a foundation for long-term social change that contributes to the well-being of individuals worldwide.\nObjectives\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) has set ambitious yet achievable objectives to ensure a broad and lasting impact on global well-being.\nEducational Expansion\nOur first objective focuses on education expansion. Within the first year GHIF plans to launch educational programs in at least two countries aiming to reach over 5000 individuals. These programs will be developed to address local educational gaps and promote holistic learning experiences. Evidence shows that educational programs can significantly enhance psychological well-being by increasing self-efficacy social support and overall life satisfaction (Ross &amp; Willigen 1997). Moreover education has been linked to improved health outcomes and better mental health with increased years of education correlating with lower rates of depression and anxiety (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder 2022). The success of these programs will be measured by the number of programs successfully launched the total number of participants enrolled and participant feedback on program effectiveness.\nHealthcare Partnerships\nSimultaneously GHIF aims to establish healthcare partnerships to enhance access to medical and mental health services. By the end of the first six months we will secure partnerships with at least five major healthcare providers. These collaborations will focus on providing comprehensive health services emphasizing preventive care and mental health which are crucial for improving individual well-being. Studies have shown that partnerships between educational institutions and healthcare providers can significantly improve health outcomes particularly in preventive care and mental health services (Ross &amp; Wu 1995). The effectiveness of these partnerships will be assessed through the number of agreements signed the range of services provided and feedback from service users regarding the accessibility and quality of care.\nWellness Travel Model\nLastly our third objective is to develop a wellness travel model which will be designed developed and ready for implementation within the first eighteen months. This model will provide frameworks for wellness-oriented travel experiences promoting mental and physical health benefits through carefully crafted travel packages. Wellness programs embedded in educational and travel contexts have shown positive impacts on well-being reducing stress and improving mental health (Young et al. 2020). The model\u2019s success will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction measured through surveys and the repeat engagement rate indicating the model&#x27;s appeal and effectiveness in enhancing participants&#x27; well-being.\nOrganizational Capacity\nFoundation Structure and Management Capability:\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is designed to be a robust organization capable of managing large-scale projects and substantial grants. At its inception GHIF will establish a governance structure with a board of directors comprising education healthcare mental health and non-profit management experts. This board will provide strategic oversight and ensure all activities align with our mission and objectives.\nFounding Team Expertise:\nThe founding team of GHIF will include highly qualified professionals selected for their extensive experience in project management international development healthcare and educational programming. Our recruitment strategy focuses on identifying individuals with a proven track record such as a Project Director with significant experience in managing and scaling community health programs an Education Specialist renowned for developing effective curricula in diverse cultural settings and a Mental Health Advocate with a strong background in leading global mental wellness initiatives. This planned assembly of expertise ensures a comprehensive and skilled approach to achieving the foundation\u2019s objectives.\nProject Management Systems:\nGHIF will implement rigorous project management methodologies to oversee all foundation activities. We will utilize established frameworks such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guidelines to plan execute monitor and close projects. Additionally GHIF will adopt modern project management tools for real-time tracking and reporting facilitating transparent and efficient management of the grant funds.\nPreparatory Actions for Grant Management:\nPrior to receiving the grant GHIF will:\nFormulate detailed project plans including timelines budgets and resource allocation.\nEstablish financial management policies tailored to ensure accountability and prudent use of funds.\nInitiate discussions with potential partners and stakeholders to build a support network for immediate project launch upon funding.\nDemonstrating Capacity through Strategic Intentions:\nWhile GHIF is a nascent organization our strategic planning reflects a clear and actionable roadmap for immediate impact upon funding. The foundation\u2019s goals are backed by a commitment to leverage the diverse skills of its team and the strategic insights of its board to establish a high-performing organization. GHIF&#x27;s initial actions and detailed project preparations demonstrate our readiness and capability to effectively manage and utilize the grant to achieve significant social impact.\nCross-Sector Collaboration \nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to developing localized high-impact programs that serve as models for global implementation. To achieve this GHIF emphasizes cross-sector collaboration mainly focusing on strategic partnerships in Italy and the United States. These collaborations are designed to leverage regional strengths and address specific local needs ensuring the adaptability and effectiveness of our well-being services.\nLocalized Educational Partnerships\nGHIF will collaborate with leading educational institutions in Italy and the United States to integrate well-being practices into educational curricula. This initiative will focus on regions with significant disparities in educational outcomes providing targeted interventions that are culturally and contextually relevant. Research indicates that collaborative learning environments and educational partnerships can significantly enhance student outcomes and well-being (Kilgo et al. 2015). Success in these partnerships will be evaluated based on educational improvements student well-being metrics and the scalability of the programs to other regions.\nHealthcare Alliances\nGHIF plans to partner with healthcare organizations in Italy and the United States to increase access to quality health services. These partnerships will focus on integrating mental health services with primary care a critical need in both countries according to local health reports. Studies have shown cross-sector healthcare collaborations can improve health outcomes particularly when mental health services are integrated with primary care (Randall et al. 2023). By working with local health providers and community organizations these initiatives aim to create sustainable health improvement models suitable for global replication.\nPublic-Private Partnerships\nGHIF will seek partnerships with local government bodies and private sectors in Italy and the United States to support infrastructure development vital to program delivery. These partnerships will help facilitate the creation of community wellness centers which will serve as hubs for education healthcare and community activities. Effective public-private partnerships have been shown to significantly enhance community health and well-being (Ovseiko et al. 2014). The effectiveness of these centers will be measured through community engagement rates and the overall improvement in community health and educational outcomes.\nCommunity Engagement\nIntegral to our strategy is the direct involvement of local communities in Italy and the United States in the planning and implementation phases. GHIF believes that community input is essential to tailoring programs that genuinely reflect and meet local needs. Feedback mechanisms and community advisory boards will be established to monitor the programs\u2019 impacts and guide iterative improvements as there is evidence proving that community involvement is crucial for the success and sustainability of public health programs (Mattessich &amp; Rausch 2014).", "title": "GW ASSIGNMENT 1.docx", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "396b19be-29dc-4c4f-be29-2a2f36206399", "request_id": "886b67a89e070e93-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "396b19be-29dc-4c4f-be29-2a2f36206399", "children": ["4be6dcba-1c7f-42e7-9fdb-a295ff0d1be1"]}, "4be6dcba-1c7f-42e7-9fdb-a295ff0d1be1": {"id": "4be6dcba-1c7f-42e7-9fdb-a295ff0d1be1", "message": {"id": "4be6dcba-1c7f-42e7-9fdb-a295ff0d1be1", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716198480.542749, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Based on the information provided in your assignment draft and the instructions for the assignment, here&#x27;s how your draft aligns with the rubric and instructions:\n\n### Introduction and Purpose\nYour introduction effectively establishes the vision and mission of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation, focusing on individual happiness as a societal asset. It&#x27;s clear and introduces the project well. The purpose section also clearly outlines the primary aim of enhancing well-being and happiness through access to essential services. This aligns well with the assignment instructions that require a compelling introduction to the organization and proposed project.\n\n### Goals and Objectives\nThe goals and objectives section in your draft is detailed and well-aligned with the instructions. It presents long-term and short-term goals, aligning with the rubric&#x27;s requirements to describe the proposed strategies and how they address the project&#x27;s goals. Your objectives section further breaks down the goals into actionable programs, which should meet the criteria for a clear and concise description of the intervention being proposed.\n\n### Organizational Capacity and Cross-Sector Collaboration\nYou have thoroughly detailed the organizational structure, expertise, and strategic planning for project management, which aligns with the rubric&#x27;s criteria for Organizational Capacity. For Cross-Sector Collaboration, your draft explains strategic partnerships in the U.S. and Italy, focusing on integrating services and enhancing access, which should satisfy the rubric&#x27;s requirements for demonstrating strong partnerships.\n\n### Clarity and Mechanics\nYour draft is articulate and appears to be well-written, which should satisfy the rubric&#x27;s requirement for graduate-level writing, correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Ensure that all references are cited in APA format, as required.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **Ensure APA Style Compliance**: Make sure that all citations and references adhere to APA style as specified in the assignment instructions.\n2. **Program Plan Detailing**: Consider adding more specifics to the Program Plan section about the strategies, activities, and interventions, including a timeline if not yet included. This will address the rubric&#x27;s requirement for a detailed program plan, expected challenges, and timeline appropriateness.\n3. **Clarify Measures and Metrics**: While you discuss the impact of your initiatives, explicitly stating the metrics for success (like specific improvements in health and education outcomes) in each section could enhance clarity and alignment with the rubric&#x27;s expectations for detailed and measurable outcomes.\n4. **Integration and Duplication**: Make sure to emphasize how your strategies complement existing efforts in the community, addressing the rubric&#x27;s focus on ensuring that the project does not duplicate but complements other efforts.\n\nOverall, your assignment draft is comprehensive and well-structured. With some enhancements, particularly in detailing the program plan and ensuring strict adherence to APA style, it should meet the criteria laid out in the rubric and instructions effectively."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true
