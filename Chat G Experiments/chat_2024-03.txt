Here are some common scenarios:\n\n### 1. Web Development\nFor HTML documents, you can switch stylesheets using JavaScript. While you can&#x27;t literally apply a new stylesheet with a &quot;single physical click&quot; without first writing the script that does so, once set up, changing styles can be as easy as clicking a button. Here&#x27;s a basic example:\n\n```html\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;default.css&quot; id=&quot;theme-style&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;button onclick=&quot;changeStyle(&#x27;alternate.css&#x27;)&quot;&gt;Change Style&lt;/button&gt;\n\n    &lt;script&gt;\n        function changeStyle(sheet) {\n            document.getElementById(&#x27;theme-style&#x27;).setAttribute(&#x27;href&#x27;, sheet);\n        }\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n```\n\nIn this example, clicking the button calls the `changeStyle` function, which changes the stylesheet applied to the page by altering the `href` attribute of the `&lt;link&gt;` tag with the `id` of &quot;theme-style&quot;.\n\n### 2. Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs)\nMost modern word processing software allows for the application of pre-defined styles or templates, which can change the look of a document instantly. However, applying these with a &quot;single click&quot; typically means having a toolbar or menu open from which you can select your new style. For example, in Google Docs:\n\n- You can create or import a set of styles.\n- Use the `Styles` menu to select your desired style, which is then applied to the document.\n\n### 3. Text Editors and IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)\nFor coding projects or plain text documents, many text editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) support extensions or plugins that allow quick switching between different syntax highlighting themes or styles. Once a theme is installed, switching between themes can often be done with just a few clicks or a keyboard shortcut.\n\n### 4. CSS Preprocessors (Sass, Less)\nFor more advanced web development projects, CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less can make it easier to manage styles. They allow you to define variables, functions, and mixins that can be reused across stylesheets. While this approach doesn&#x27;t apply a stylesheet with a click, it significantly simplifies the process of changing styles across a site by altering a few variables.\n\nIn each case, the precise method to &quot;one-click apply&quot; a style sheet will depend on the tools and platforms you&#x27;re using."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "270048d9-6170-4439-bf7e-557519b4eacf", "request_id": "86d631f7aabe0e5e-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "270048d9-6170-4439-bf7e-557519b4eacf", "children": ["5576dfe1-728f-4a24-b218-7ac63b63ea83"]}, "5576dfe1-728f-4a24-b218-7ac63b63ea83": {"id": "5576dfe1-728f-4a24-b218-7ac63b63ea83", "message": {"id": "5576dfe1-728f-4a24-b218-7ac63b63ea83", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1711949617.018258, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Well i mean for a resume"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "86d63490ac200e5e-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "419b26ed-4205-41d1-a095-b756f9893318", "children": ["4b369803-aa90-4a50-b764-4f0de9adda1d"]}, "4b369803-aa90-4a50-b764-4f0de9adda1d": {"id": "4b369803-aa90-4a50-b764-4f0de9adda1d", "message": {"id": "4b369803-aa90-4a50-b764-4f0de9adda1d", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1711949653.509294, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Applying a style sheet to a resume with a single click suggests you&#x27;re looking for a way to quickly change the design or format of your resume. This functionality is often found in online resume builders and word processing software, where templates act as style sheets. Here&#x27;s how it works in common scenarios:\n\n### Online Resume Builders:\nMany online resume builders allow you to apply different templates to your resume content with a single click. Once you&#x27;ve entered your information into the builder&#x27;s interface, you can usually preview and apply different styles or templates from their collection. This changes the appearance of your resume instantly without altering the content. Websites like LinkedIn, Canva, and Zety offer such features.\n\n### Microsoft Word or Google Docs:\nIf you&#x27;re using a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, the concept is similar but slightly less dynamic:\n\n- **Microsoft Word**: You can create different styles for headings, body text, etc., and save these styles as a template. You can also download resume templates where the styles are predefined. Applying a template to an existing document might require copying the content into the new template file.\n- **Google Docs**: Similar to Microsoft Word, Google Docs offers various templates. You can open a template and paste your resume content into it, effectively applying the template&#x27;s style to your content with a few clicks.\n\n### LaTeX:\nFor academic and technical resumes, LaTeX is a popular tool that separates content from style. You define your resume content once and can apply different LaTeX resume templates (style sheets) to this content. Changing the template can dramatically alter the appearance of the resume. This process might involve a bit more than one click but is highly effective for applying different styles.\n\n### Design Software:\nIf your resume is more design-oriented, software like Adobe InDesign allows you to create and apply master pages (templates) that define styles for various elements of your document. While applying a new master page or template might require a few clicks, it&#x27;s a powerful way to change the look of your resume.\n\nIn each of these scenarios, the key is having your content separated from the formatting so you can quickly apply new formats or styles without having to redo your resume each time. This approach saves time and allows you to customize your resume for different applications easily."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "5576dfe1-728f-4a24-b218-7ac63b63ea83", "request_id": "86d63490ac200e5e-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5576dfe1-728f-4a24-b218-7ac63b63ea83", "children": ["eeec931e-0402-4519-bb2d-60ae55a12319"]}, "eeec931e-0402-4519-bb2d-60ae55a12319": {"id": "eeec931e-0402-4519-bb2d-60ae55a12319", "message": {"id": "eeec931e-0402-4519-bb2d-60ae55a12319", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1711949694.544973, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "86d636758d840e5e-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4b369803-aa90-4a50-b764-4f0de9adda1d", "children": ["aea54e4b-bdc7-4098-b87c-1e984adfc3e9"]}, "aea54e4b-bdc7-4098-b87c-1e984adfc3e9": {"id": "aea54e4b-bdc7-4098-b87c-1e984adfc3e9", "message": {"id": "aea54e4b-bdc7-4098-b87c-1e984adfc3e9", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1711949703.394754, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Great!

Homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschooling success statistics, 78% of peer-reviewed studies on academic achievements show that homeschool students perform statistically significantly better than students in institutional schools. (6)\n\nHere are some brief summaries of studies on homeschooling.\n\nAuthor(s)Results of the Studies   \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2013, 2017 Homeschooled score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.  \nRay, 2015 Black homeschool students scored 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students.  \nMartin-Chang et al., 2011 Researchers found that children from structured homeschool settings outperformed their conventional school peers (by 0.06 to 0.15 effect sizes).  \nRudner, 1999 Median scores for home school students fell between the 70th and 80th percentile. The study concluded that those parents choosing to make a commitment to homeschooling are able to provide a very successful academic environment.  \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2017 Home-educated students typically score above average on the college admission SAT and ACT tests.  \nCogan, 2010 College students who were homeschooled earn higher first-year and fourth-year GPAs when controlling for demographic, pre-college, engagement, and first-term academic factors.  \n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed research papers on homeschooling found a positive effect of homeschooling compared to institutional schooling. The same positive outcomes were also revealed regarding social and emotional development. (6)\n\nThe positive effect was real and measurable also for homeschooled students who later became adults compared to those who had been in conventional schools.\n\n### 5. The highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) latest homeschooled kids statistics, the highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.

(7)\n\nOverall, the grade distribution is roughly even across all grade levels above kindergarten.\n\n### 6. 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) homeschool demographics data, a surprising 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children. (7)\n\n3+ Children 2 Children 1 Child   \n48% of households 33% of households 19% of households  \n\nInterestingly enough, the homeschool data shows that only 19% of homeschooling households have 1 child and 33% have 2 children.\n\nOne can argue anecdotally, that in a household with three or more children, there\u2019s already a significantly higher focus on kids. So perhaps it can be easier to homeschool all of them together.\n\nWhite Black Hispanic Asian Other   \n70%6%17%2%6%  \n\nThe NCES data also shows that 7 in 10 homeschool students are white. (7)\n\nThe second most common ethnicity of homeschooled children is Hispanic, followed by Black, Asian, and other ethnicities.\u00a0\n\n2 Parents 1 Parent Non-parental   \n83% of homeschoolers 14% of homeschoolers 3% of homeschoolers  \n\nAccording to NCES homeschool families data, 83% of homeschool students live in two-parent households, followed by 14% in 1 parent, and 3% in non-parental households. (7)\n\n### 7. The average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\nAccording to Time4Learning homeschooling cost statistics, the average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.

(8)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the average cost of homeschooling for everyone as every family has a unique situation.\n\nThe final cost depends on how many children are homeschooled, are there any special needs or health problems, and how logistically accessible libraries, museums, and so on are.\n\n### 8. 1 in 3 homeschooling households has an annual income of over $100,000.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschool studies, 34% of homeschooling households have an annual income over $100,000.

(7)\n\nCan this be correlated with higher annual income? We don\u2019t know, as there\u2019s no formal evidence on this.\n\n### 9. Homeschooling saves about $56 billion of taxpayer money annually.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI), homeschooling saves about $56 billion of taxpayer money annually. (2)\n\nTaxpayer Savings Homeschool Students Public School Cost  \n$56 billion 3.721 million$15,240 per student  \n\nThe reality is that public schools aren\u2019t free. Taxpayers spend on average $15,240 per student annually for public schools.\n\nThe more homeschooled students there are, the bigger savings there will be for the federal government on taxpayers\u2019 money. This is $56 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money that can be used for other causes.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How much does homeschooling cost?\n\nThe average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\n### What is homeschooling?\n\nHomeschooling is a parent-led home-based education form that is the fastest-growing in the U.S.\n\n### How many homeschool students are in the U.S.?\n\nThere are 3.7 million homeschool students in the U.S. Homeschool students make up 6.73% of all school-aged children.\n\n### Do homeschool students perform better?\n\nYes, homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\n### What percentage of students are homeschooled?\n\n6.73% (3.7 million) of all school-aged children in the U.S. are homeschooled.\n\n### Will homeschooling increase after the pandemic?\n\nYes, homeschooling rates doubled after the lockdowns in the U.S.\n\n## References\n\n  1.

(7)\n\nOverall, the grade distribution is roughly even across all grade levels above kindergarten.\n\n### 6. 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) homeschool demographics data, a surprising 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children. (7)\n\n3+ Children 2 Children 1 Child   \n48% of households 33% of households 19% of households  \n\nInterestingly enough, the homeschool data shows that only 19% of homeschooling households have 1 child and 33% have 2 children.\n\nOne can argue anecdotally, that in a household with three or more children, there\u2019s already a significantly higher focus on kids. So perhaps it can be easier to homeschool all of them together.\n\nWhite Black Hispanic Asian Other   \n70%6%17%2%6%  \n\nThe NCES data also shows that 7 in 10 homeschool students are white. (7)\n\nThe second most common ethnicity of homeschooled children is Hispanic, followed by Black, Asian, and other ethnicities.\u00a0\n\n2 Parents 1 Parent Non-parental   \n83% of homeschoolers 14% of homeschoolers 3% of homeschoolers  \n\nAccording to NCES homeschool families data, 83% of homeschool students live in two-parent households, followed by 14% in 1 parent, and 3% in non-parental households. (7)\n\n### 7. The average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\nAccording to Time4Learning homeschooling cost statistics, the average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually. (8)\n\nCategory Price range   \nCurriculum$350 \u2013 $750   \nSupplies &amp; materials$150 \u2013 $300   \nField trips$100 \u2013 $250   \nExtracurriculars$100 \u2013 $500   \nTotal$700 \u2013 $1,800  \n\nFor a family with two school-aged children, homeschooling may cost on average between $1,400 to $3,600 per year. (8)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the average cost of homeschooling for everyone as every family has a unique situation.\n\nThe final cost depends on how many children are homeschooled, are there any special needs or health problems, and how logistically accessible libraries, museums, and so on are.\n\n### 8. 1 in 3 homeschooling households has an annual income of over $100,000.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschool studies, 34% of homeschooling households have an annual income over $100,000.

(7)\n\nSecond highest annual income is $50,001 to $75,000 with 21% of households, followed by $20,001 to $50,000 and 20% of households.\n\nEducation Level Homeschooling Parents   \nHigh school diploma or less 23%  \nVocational/technical, associate\u2019s degree, or some college 26%  \nBachelor\u2019s degree/some graduate school 31%  \nGraduate/professional degree 21%  \n\nNHERI data also reveals that 31% of homeschooling parents own a bachelor\u2019s or some graduate school degree. (7)\n\nCan this be correlated with higher annual income? We don\u2019t know, as there\u2019s no formal evidence on this.\n\n### 9. Homeschooling saves about $56 billion of taxpayer money annually.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI), homeschooling saves about $56 billion of taxpayer money annually. (2)\n\nTaxpayer Savings Homeschool Students Public School Cost  \n$56 billion 3.721 million$15,240 per student  \n\nThe reality is that public schools aren\u2019t free. Taxpayers spend on average $15,240 per student annually for public schools.\n\nThe more homeschooled students there are, the bigger savings there will be for the federal government on taxpayers\u2019 money. This is $56 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money that can be used for other causes.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How much does homeschooling cost?\n\nThe average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\n### What is homeschooling?\n\nHomeschooling is a parent-led home-based education form that is the fastest-growing in the U.S.\n\n### How many homeschool students are in the U.S.?\n\nThere are 3.7 million homeschool students in the U.S. Homeschool students make up 6.73% of all school-aged children.\n\n### Do homeschool students perform better?\n\nYes, homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\n### What percentage of students are homeschooled?\n\n6.73% (3.7 million) of all school-aged children in the U.S. are homeschooled.\n\n### Will homeschooling increase after the pandemic?\n\nYes, homeschooling rates doubled after the lockdowns in the U.S.\n\n## References\n\n  1.

Today, more and more parents are choosing to \u301041\u2020educate their children at home\u3011, fueling the rise of homeschooling in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a new \u301042\u2020joint analysis\u2020news.stanford.edu\u3011 by the Associated Press and researchers from Stanford University, a whopping 1.2 million K-12 schoolchildren remain missing from public schools since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit in 2020. The study, which examined 22 jurisdictions, found that roughly 26% of these students switched to homeschooling. The question is, what is leading to this rise in homeschooling?\n\nThe beginning of the pandemic was a scary, uncertain time. According to U.S. Census Bureau reporting, many parents wanted to keep their children at home, not just to ensure social distancing but also to meet their socio-emotional needs. The Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found that from April to October 2020, the number of households with school-age children reporting them as homeschooled rose from 5.4% to 11.1%. Now that the pandemic\u2019s various closures are over in the U.S., it\u2019s clear these sentiments are persisting; many parents no longer trust the public school system. Thanks to \u301043\u2020underfunded schools\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and crowded classrooms, many parents believe their children are no longer getting the attention they deserve. This is especially true for students who need \u301044\u2020special care\u2020apnews.com\u3011 and attention. At home, though, parents hypothetically can control all of these various needs in a personalized way.\n\nHow are educators responding to this rise in homeschooling across the U.S.? Educator and philanthropist \u301045\u2020Diane Lewis\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, who founded \u301046\u2020Firefly Tutors\u2020www.fireflytutors.com\u3011 two years ago with the aim to impart high-quality yet affordable education to her students, had this to say.\n\n### Diane\u2019s Thoughts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend of parents choosing to homeschool in the US. Nearly 7% of parents homeschool one or more of their children. In California, where I reside, it\u2019s more than 9%, and numbers are rising. Why?\n\nDue to a variety of reasons, parents are bridging the gaps in education for their children. A child may not be receiving adequate instruction at a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn\u2019t mean that the teachers are terrible or that the schools are bad! Unfortunately, our education system needs reform to better fund and serve students with special needs, those that are gifted, and those with unique learning differences.\n\nMany great private schools offer specialized learning programs, but most parents can\u2019t afford the tuition. Homeschool offers a simple, affordable alternative for parents who want customized learning. Each student is unique. Homeschooling allows for targeted blends of sensory integration into the learning process, which promotes greater comprehension and retention that helps each student to reach their highest potential.\u201d\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest updates in B2B!\n\n\u301047\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \u301048\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020 \u2020company.marketscale.com\u3011 \n\n### Latest\n\n\u301051\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301051\u2020Revolutionize Truck Driver Engagement in Logistics: Integrate Texting and Social Media for Stronger Relationships and Increased Efficiency\u3011 \n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe logistics and supply chain sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need for more efficient communication channels between companies and frontline workers, particularly truck drivers.

The question is, what is leading to this rise in homeschooling?\n\nThe beginning of the pandemic was a scary, uncertain time. According to U.S. Census Bureau reporting, many parents wanted to keep their children at home, not just to ensure social distancing but also to meet their socio-emotional needs. The Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found that from April to October 2020, the number of households with school-age children reporting them as homeschooled rose from 5.4% to 11.1%. Now that the pandemic\u2019s various closures are over in the U.S., it\u2019s clear these sentiments are persisting; many parents no longer trust the public school system. Thanks to \u301043\u2020underfunded schools\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and crowded classrooms, many parents believe their children are no longer getting the attention they deserve. This is especially true for students who need \u301044\u2020special care\u2020apnews.com\u3011 and attention. At home, though, parents hypothetically can control all of these various needs in a personalized way.\n\nHow are educators responding to this rise in homeschooling across the U.S.? Educator and philanthropist \u301045\u2020Diane Lewis\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, who founded \u301046\u2020Firefly Tutors\u2020www.fireflytutors.com\u3011 two years ago with the aim to impart high-quality yet affordable education to her students, had this to say.\n\n### Diane\u2019s Thoughts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend of parents choosing to homeschool in the US. Nearly 7% of parents homeschool one or more of their children. In California, where I reside, it\u2019s more than 9%, and numbers are rising. Why?\n\nDue to a variety of reasons, parents are bridging the gaps in education for their children. A child may not be receiving adequate instruction at a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn\u2019t mean that the teachers are terrible or that the schools are bad! Unfortunately, our education system needs reform to better fund and serve students with special needs, those that are gifted, and those with unique learning differences.\n\nMany great private schools offer specialized learning programs, but most parents can\u2019t afford the tuition. Homeschool offers a simple, affordable alternative for parents who want customized learning. Each student is unique. Homeschooling allows for targeted blends of sensory integration into the learning process, which promotes greater comprehension and retention that helps each student to reach their highest potential.\u201d\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest updates in B2B!\n\n\u301047\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \u301048\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020 \u2020company.marketscale.com\u3011 \n\n### Latest\n\n\u301051\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301051\u2020Revolutionize Truck Driver Engagement in Logistics: Integrate Texting and Social Media for Stronger Relationships and Increased Efficiency\u3011 \n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe logistics and supply chain sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need for more efficient communication channels between companies and frontline workers, particularly truck drivers.

The homeschooling market is expanding, driven by various factors including concerns over school environments, a desire for personalized instruction, and dissatisfaction with traditional schooling methods. The homeschooling sector in the United States alone has seen a compound annual growth rate of 9.8% from 2019 to 2029, with projections indicating the market could reach USD 10.14 billion by 2029\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\nA considerable portion of this growth stems from parents&#x27; concerns over school safety, academic quality, and the desire to provide religious or moral instruction, among other reasons. Additionally, there&#x27;s a high level of interest in homeschooling for middle school-aged students (grades 6 to 8), which represents the highest rate of homeschooling among all grade levels. It&#x27;s also notable that a significant portion of homeschooling households have three or more children, and many of these households fall into higher income brackets\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe shift towards homeschooling has been further fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many parents continuing to choose homeschooling due to dissatisfaction with the public school system and a desire for a more tailored educational experience for their children. This trend is supported by a variety of educational resources and platforms, with a wide range of teaching methods such as the Classical Method, Charlotte Mason Method, Montessori Method, and Unit Studies being popular among homeschooling families\u30107\u2020source\u3011\u30106\u2020source\u3011.\n\nGiven these insights, creating courses that cater to the diverse needs of homeschooling families can be quite promising. Course creators should consider developing curriculums that are adaptable to different teaching methods, offer personalized learning experiences, and cater to a wide range of subjects across various grade levels. Additionally, focusing on subjects where parents feel less confident in teaching, such as advanced science or math, could fulfill an important niche in the homeschooling market. \n\nWith the growing prevalence of online homeschooling platforms and the continuous search for high-quality educational content, there&#x27;s a significant opportunity to contribute to this expanding market by offering courses that address these needs and preferences."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [{"start_ix": 531, "end_ix": 541, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Home-schooling Market Share", "url": "https://www.adroitmarketresearch.com/industry-reports/home-schooling-market", "text": "\nHome-schooled students frequently participate in social and educational activities with persons who are not part of their immediate family outside of their homes.

Homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschooling success statistics, 78% of peer-reviewed studies on academic achievements show that homeschool students perform statistically significantly better than students in institutional schools. (6)\n\nHere are some brief summaries of studies on homeschooling.\n\nAuthor(s)Results of the Studies   \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2013, 2017 Homeschooled score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.  \nRay, 2015 Black homeschool students scored 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students.  \nMartin-Chang et al., 2011 Researchers found that children from structured homeschool settings outperformed their conventional school peers (by 0.06 to 0.15 effect sizes).  \nRudner, 1999 Median scores for home school students fell between the 70th and 80th percentile. The study concluded that those parents choosing to make a commitment to homeschooling are able to provide a very successful academic environment.  \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2017 Home-educated students typically score above average on the college admission SAT and ACT tests.  \nCogan, 2010 College students who were homeschooled earn higher first-year and fourth-year GPAs when controlling for demographic, pre-college, engagement, and first-term academic factors.  \n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed research papers on homeschooling found a positive effect of homeschooling compared to institutional schooling. The same positive outcomes were also revealed regarding social and emotional development. (6)\n\nThe positive effect was real and measurable also for homeschooled students who later became adults compared to those who had been in conventional schools.\n\n### 5. The highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) latest homeschooled kids statistics, the highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.

(7)\n\nOverall, the grade distribution is roughly even across all grade levels above kindergarten.\n\n### 6. 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) homeschool demographics data, a surprising 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children. (7)\n\n3+ Children 2 Children 1 Child   \n48% of households 33% of households 19% of households  \n\nInterestingly enough, the homeschool data shows that only 19% of homeschooling households have 1 child and 33% have 2 children.\n\nOne can argue anecdotally, that in a household with three or more children, there\u2019s already a significantly higher focus on kids. So perhaps it can be easier to homeschool all of them together.\n\nWhite Black Hispanic Asian Other   \n70%6%17%2%6%  \n\nThe NCES data also shows that 7 in 10 homeschool students are white.

The average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\nAccording to Time4Learning homeschooling cost statistics, the average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.

(8)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the average cost of homeschooling for everyone as every family has a unique situation.\n\nThe final cost depends on how many children are homeschooled, are there any special needs or health problems, and how logistically accessible libraries, museums, and so on are.\n\n### 8. 1 in 3 homeschooling households has an annual income of over $100,000.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschool studies, 34% of homeschooling households have an annual income over $100,000.

Homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschooling success statistics, 78% of peer-reviewed studies on academic achievements show that homeschool students perform statistically significantly better than students in institutional schools. (6)\n\nHere are some brief summaries of studies on homeschooling.\n\nAuthor(s)Results of the Studies   \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2013, 2017 Homeschooled score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.  \nRay, 2015 Black homeschool students scored 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students.  \nMartin-Chang et al., 2011 Researchers found that children from structured homeschool settings outperformed their conventional school peers (by 0.06 to 0.15 effect sizes).  \nRudner, 1999 Median scores for home school students fell between the 70th and 80th percentile. The study concluded that those parents choosing to make a commitment to homeschooling are able to provide a very successful academic environment.  \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2017 Home-educated students typically score above average on the college admission SAT and ACT tests.  \nCogan, 2010 College students who were homeschooled earn higher first-year and fourth-year GPAs when controlling for demographic, pre-college, engagement, and first-term academic factors.  \n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed research papers on homeschooling found a positive effect of homeschooling compared to institutional schooling. The same positive outcomes were also revealed regarding social and emotional development. (6)\n\nThe positive effect was real and measurable also for homeschooled students who later became adults compared to those who had been in conventional schools.\n\n### 5. The highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) latest homeschooled kids statistics, the highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.

(7)\n\nOverall, the grade distribution is roughly even across all grade levels above kindergarten.\n\n### 6. 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) homeschool demographics data, a surprising 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children. (7)\n\n3+ Children 2 Children 1 Child   \n48% of households 33% of households 19% of households  \n\nInterestingly enough, the homeschool data shows that only 19% of homeschooling households have 1 child and 33% have 2 children.\n\nOne can argue anecdotally, that in a household with three or more children, there\u2019s already a significantly higher focus on kids. So perhaps it can be easier to homeschool all of them together.\n\nWhite Black Hispanic Asian Other   \n70%6%17%2%6%  \n\nThe NCES data also shows that 7 in 10 homeschool students are white.

(8)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the average cost of homeschooling for everyone as every family has a unique situation.\n\nThe final cost depends on how many children are homeschooled, are there any special needs or health problems, and how logistically accessible libraries, museums, and so on are.\n\n### 8. 1 in 3 homeschooling households has an annual income of over $100,000.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschool studies, 34% of homeschooling households have an annual income over $100,000.

Today, more and more parents are choosing to \u301041\u2020educate their children at home\u3011, fueling the rise of homeschooling in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a new \u301042\u2020joint analysis\u2020news.stanford.edu\u3011 by the Associated Press and researchers from Stanford University, a whopping 1.2 million K-12 schoolchildren remain missing from public schools since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit in 2020. The study, which examined 22 jurisdictions, found that roughly 26% of these students switched to homeschooling. The question is, what is leading to this rise in homeschooling?\n\nThe beginning of the pandemic was a scary, uncertain time. According to U.S. Census Bureau reporting, many parents wanted to keep their children at home, not just to ensure social distancing but also to meet their socio-emotional needs. The Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found that from April to October 2020, the number of households with school-age children reporting them as homeschooled rose from 5.4% to 11.1%. Now that the pandemic\u2019s various closures are over in the U.S., it\u2019s clear these sentiments are persisting; many parents no longer trust the public school system. Thanks to \u301043\u2020underfunded schools\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and crowded classrooms, many parents believe their children are no longer getting the attention they deserve. This is especially true for students who need \u301044\u2020special care\u2020apnews.com\u3011 and attention. At home, though, parents hypothetically can control all of these various needs in a personalized way.\n\nHow are educators responding to this rise in homeschooling across the U.S.? Educator and philanthropist \u301045\u2020Diane Lewis\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, who founded \u301046\u2020Firefly Tutors\u2020www.fireflytutors.com\u3011 two years ago with the aim to impart high-quality yet affordable education to her students, had this to say.\n\n### Diane\u2019s Thoughts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend of parents choosing to homeschool in the US. Nearly 7% of parents homeschool one or more of their children. In California, where I reside, it\u2019s more than 9%, and numbers are rising. Why?\n\nDue to a variety of reasons, parents are bridging the gaps in education for their children. A child may not be receiving adequate instruction at a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn\u2019t mean that the teachers are terrible or that the schools are bad! Unfortunately, our education system needs reform to better fund and serve students with special needs, those that are gifted, and those with unique learning differences.\n\nMany great private schools offer specialized learning programs, but most parents can\u2019t afford the tuition. Homeschool offers a simple, affordable alternative for parents who want customized learning. Each student is unique. Homeschooling allows for targeted blends of sensory integration into the learning process, which promotes greater comprehension and retention that helps each student to reach their highest potential.\u201d\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest updates in B2B!\n\n\u301047\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \u301048\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020 \u2020company.marketscale.com\u3011 \n\n### Latest\n\n\u301051\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301051\u2020Revolutionize Truck Driver Engagement in Logistics: Integrate Texting and Social Media for Stronger Relationships and Increased Efficiency\u3011 \n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe logistics and supply chain sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need for more efficient communication channels between companies and frontline workers, particularly truck drivers.

The same positive outcomes were also revealed regarding social and emotional development.

(7)\n\nOverall, the grade distribution is roughly even across all grade levels above kindergarten.\n\n### 6. 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) homeschool demographics data, a surprising 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children. (7)\n\n3+ Children 2 Children 1 Child   \n48% of households 33% of households 19% of households  \n\nInterestingly enough, the homeschool data shows that only 19% of homeschooling households have 1 child and 33% have 2 children.\n\nOne can argue anecdotally, that in a household with three or more children, there\u2019s already a significantly higher focus on kids. So perhaps it can be easier to homeschool all of them together.\n\nWhite Black Hispanic Asian Other   \n70%6%17%2%6%  \n\nThe NCES data also shows that 7 in 10 homeschool students are white.

The average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\nAccording to Time4Learning homeschooling cost statistics, the average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.

(8)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the average cost of homeschooling for everyone as every family has a unique situation.\n\nThe final cost depends on how many children are homeschooled, are there any special needs or health problems, and how logistically accessible libraries, museums, and so on are.\n\n### 8. 1 in 3 homeschooling households has an annual income of over $100,000.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschool studies, 34% of homeschooling households have an annual income over $100,000.

(7)\n\nCan this be correlated with higher annual income? We don\u2019t know, as there\u2019s no formal evidence on this.\n\n### 9. Homeschooling saves about $56 billion of taxpayer money annually.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI), homeschooling saves about $56 billion of taxpayer money annually. (2)\n\nTaxpayer Savings Homeschool Students Public School Cost  \n$56 billion 3.721 million$15,240 per student  \n\nThe reality is that public schools aren\u2019t free. Taxpayers spend on average $15,240 per student annually for public schools.\n\nThe more homeschooled students there are, the bigger savings there will be for the federal government on taxpayers\u2019 money. This is $56 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money that can be used for other causes.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How much does homeschooling cost?\n\nThe average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\n### What is homeschooling?\n\nHomeschooling is a parent-led home-based education form that is the fastest-growing in the U.S.\n\n### How many homeschool students are in the U.S.?\n\nThere are 3.7 million homeschool students in the U.S. Homeschool students make up 6.73% of all school-aged children.\n\n### Do homeschool students perform better?\n\nYes, homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\n### What percentage of students are homeschooled?\n\n6.73% (3.7 million) of all school-aged children in the U.S. are homeschooled.\n\n### Will homeschooling increase after the pandemic?\n\nYes, homeschooling rates doubled after the lockdowns in the U.S.\n\n## References\n\n  1.

(7)\n\n3+ Children 2 Children 1 Child   \n48% of households 33% of households 19% of households  \n\nInterestingly enough, the homeschool data shows that only 19% of homeschooling households have 1 child and 33% have 2 children.\n\nOne can argue anecdotally, that in a household with three or more children, there\u2019s already a significantly higher focus on kids. So perhaps it can be easier to homeschool all of them together.\n\nWhite Black Hispanic Asian Other   \n70%6%17%2%6%  \n\nThe NCES data also shows that 7 in 10 homeschool students are white. (7)\n\nThe second most common ethnicity of homeschooled children is Hispanic, followed by Black, Asian, and other ethnicities.\u00a0\n\n2 Parents 1 Parent Non-parental   \n83% of homeschoolers 14% of homeschoolers 3% of homeschoolers  \n\nAccording to NCES homeschool families data, 83% of homeschool students live in two-parent households, followed by 14% in 1 parent, and 3% in non-parental households. (7)\n\n### 7. The average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\nAccording to Time4Learning homeschooling cost statistics, the average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.

(8)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the average cost of homeschooling for everyone as every family has a unique situation.\n\nThe final cost depends on how many children are homeschooled, are there any special needs or health problems, and how logistically accessible libraries, museums, and so on are.\n\n### 8. 1 in 3 homeschooling households has an annual income of over $100,000.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschool studies, 34% of homeschooling households have an annual income over $100,000.

(7)\n\nCan this be correlated with higher annual income? We don\u2019t know, as there\u2019s no formal evidence on this.\n\n### 9. Homeschooling saves about $56 billion of taxpayer money annually.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI), homeschooling saves about $56 billion of taxpayer money annually. (2)\n\nTaxpayer Savings Homeschool Students Public School Cost  \n$56 billion 3.721 million$15,240 per student  \n\nThe reality is that public schools aren\u2019t free. Taxpayers spend on average $15,240 per student annually for public schools.\n\nThe more homeschooled students there are, the bigger savings there will be for the federal government on taxpayers\u2019 money. This is $56 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money that can be used for other causes.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How much does homeschooling cost?\n\nThe average cost of homeschooling is $700-$1,800 per student annually.\n\n### What is homeschooling?\n\nHomeschooling is a parent-led home-based education form that is the fastest-growing in the U.S.\n\n### How many homeschool students are in the U.S.?\n\nThere are 3.7 million homeschool students in the U.S. Homeschool students make up 6.73% of all school-aged children.\n\n### Do homeschool students perform better?\n\nYes, homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\n### What percentage of students are homeschooled?\n\n6.73% (3.7 million) of all school-aged children in the U.S. are homeschooled.\n\n### Will homeschooling increase after the pandemic?\n\nYes, homeschooling rates doubled after the lockdowns in the U.S.\n\n## References\n\n  1.

Today, more and more parents are choosing to \u301041\u2020educate their children at home\u3011, fueling the rise of homeschooling in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a new \u301042\u2020joint analysis\u2020news.stanford.edu\u3011 by the Associated Press and researchers from Stanford University, a whopping 1.2 million K-12 schoolchildren remain missing from public schools since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit in 2020. The study, which examined 22 jurisdictions, found that roughly 26% of these students switched to homeschooling. The question is, what is leading to this rise in homeschooling?\n\nThe beginning of the pandemic was a scary, uncertain time. According to U.S. Census Bureau reporting, many parents wanted to keep their children at home, not just to ensure social distancing but also to meet their socio-emotional needs. The Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found that from April to October 2020, the number of households with school-age children reporting them as homeschooled rose from 5.4% to 11.1%. Now that the pandemic\u2019s various closures are over in the U.S., it\u2019s clear these sentiments are persisting; many parents no longer trust the public school system. Thanks to \u301043\u2020underfunded schools\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and crowded classrooms, many parents believe their children are no longer getting the attention they deserve. This is especially true for students who need \u301044\u2020special care\u2020apnews.com\u3011 and attention. At home, though, parents hypothetically can control all of these various needs in a personalized way.\n\nHow are educators responding to this rise in homeschooling across the U.S.? Educator and philanthropist \u301045\u2020Diane Lewis\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, who founded \u301046\u2020Firefly Tutors\u2020www.fireflytutors.com\u3011 two years ago with the aim to impart high-quality yet affordable education to her students, had this to say.\n\n### Diane\u2019s Thoughts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend of parents choosing to homeschool in the US. Nearly 7% of parents homeschool one or more of their children. In California, where I reside, it\u2019s more than 9%, and numbers are rising. Why?\n\nDue to a variety of reasons, parents are bridging the gaps in education for their children. A child may not be receiving adequate instruction at a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn\u2019t mean that the teachers are terrible or that the schools are bad! Unfortunately, our education system needs reform to better fund and serve students with special needs, those that are gifted, and those with unique learning differences.\n\nMany great private schools offer specialized learning programs, but most parents can\u2019t afford the tuition. Homeschool offers a simple, affordable alternative for parents who want customized learning. Each student is unique. Homeschooling allows for targeted blends of sensory integration into the learning process, which promotes greater comprehension and retention that helps each student to reach their highest potential.\u201d\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest updates in B2B!\n\n\u301047\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \u301048\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020 \u2020company.marketscale.com\u3011 \n\n### Latest\n\n\u301051\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301051\u2020Revolutionize Truck Driver Engagement in Logistics: Integrate Texting and Social Media for Stronger Relationships and Increased Efficiency\u3011 \n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe logistics and supply chain sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need for more efficient communication channels between companies and frontline workers, particularly truck drivers.

Thinkific is a popular platform for creating and selling online courses, known for its user-friendly interface, comprehensive course creation tools, and robust support for creators. It allows educators to design courses with various multimedia elements, including videos, quizzes, surveys, and downloadable resources, which can be structured into modules and lessons to create a cohesive learning experience.\n\nFor homeschooling courses, a platform like Thinkific could be a great match due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Flexibility and Customization**: Thinkific allows course creators to tailor their content to different learning styles and educational needs, which is crucial for homeschooling. Courses can be customized to suit various homeschooling methods, grade levels, and subjects.\n\n2. **Interactive Learning**: The platform supports interactive features such as quizzes, discussions, and assignments, enhancing engagement and making it easier for homeschooling parents to track their children\u2019s progress and understanding.\n\n3. **Accessibility and Convenience**: Courses on Thinkific can be accessed anytime, anywhere, which is ideal for the flexible schedules often associated with homeschooling. This allows parents to incorporate education into daily life in a way that suits their family\u2019s routine.\n\n4. **Resource Sharing**: Thinkific courses can include downloadable materials, further supporting homeschooling efforts. Parents can access a wide range of resources to supplement their children&#x27;s learning.\n\n5. **Community Building**: The platform can foster a sense of community among course participants through discussion forums and interactions.

The increasing trend towards homeschooling, combined with the diverse reasons parents choose to homeschool, presents a significant opportunity for such a resource. Many parents are looking for comprehensive, structured guidance that aligns with current educational standards and incorporates the latest in pedagogical research.\n\nYour course could fill a critical gap by providing parents with:\n\n- **Structured Curriculum**: Outline what needs to be taught at each grade level, making sure it&#x27;s in line with current educational standards and research. This will help parents ensure they are covering necessary material.\n\n- **Teaching Materials**: Offer ready-to-use materials that parents can employ directly in their teaching. This could include worksheets, interactive activities, and multimedia resources.\n\n- **Instructional Guides**: Provide instructions on how to teach various concepts, which is particularly valuable for parents without a background in education. This might include strategies for engaging children, explaining complex ideas, and adapting teaching to different learning styles.\n\n- **Assessments and Exercises**: Include exercises, quizzes, and projects to assess children&#x27;s understanding and retention of the material. Providing answer keys and grading rubrics can also help parents gauge their child\u2019s progress.\n\n- **Support and Community**: Building a community feature into your course could provide immense value, allowing parents to share experiences, challenges, and solutions. Additionally, offering some level of direct support, whether through Q&amp;A sessions, forums, or scheduled consultations, could be a major selling point.\n\nThe key to success with this type of course will be in making it as accessible and user-friendly as possible. Consider the varying levels of comfort with technology and teaching that your audience might have. Breaking down the curriculum into manageable, bite-sized pieces can make the process less daunting for parents. Moreover, focusing on interactive and practical learning activities can make education a more engaging and enjoyable experience for both the parent and the child.\n\nGiven the homeschooling market&#x27;s projected growth and the clear demand for resources that support personalized, home-based learning, a course like the one you&#x27;re considering could meet an essential need.

The program is free upfront and our customers pay us back when they\u2019re hired.\n\nBuilt around aligned incentives, we help build equity in the job search process by providing 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and a platform to uplift job seekers and ultimately, help them fulfill their hopes, ambitions, and livelihoods. We\u2019ve already helped more than a thousand fellows land meaningful jobs, and helped them earn over $100M in salary.\n\nIn 2022 we raised our Series B and there is even more exciting growth on the horizon. That year we expanded from 6 to 14 industries, launched a tiered pricing system with differentiated product offerings, and much more.\n\nOur Mission \ud83d\ude80\nOur mission is to help people everywhere build their careers by being the world\u2019s best career agency. \n\nWe believe the job search system is broken and can be fixed with a business model that acts on behalf of the job seeker, instead of on behalf of employers, recruiters, or schools. If this sounds interesting to you, we look forward to hearing from you!\n\nRead more about our mission in our manifesto.\n\nThe Role\nThe Career Mentor team is the fastest growing team at Pathrise.

Commission is uncapped.\n\nPerformance bonuses and/or raises are evaluated annually for team members who meet the expectations for their role.\nOur culture\n\ud83d\udc4b We are a tight-knit community that champions for our staff to bring their authentic true selves to work and aim to provide a fun and collaborative work environment for everyone. Although we are remote we have many virtual and company sponsored in-person events. We also value diversity - our Career team is made up of mentors from a variety of different backgrounds and identities, and exemplifies what Pathrise stands for externally as well as internally. Read more about how we aim to create a diverse and inclusive environment: What DE&amp;I means to Pathrise \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd0e\n\nOur interview process\n- Phone chat with a recruiter \n- HackerRank assessment - no coding involved.

Think &quot;technical test&quot;, but for a career coach instead of an engineer.\n- Mock career coaching round\n- Final virtual &quot;onsite&quot;, which is a mixture of behavioral interview panels\n- Reference checks\n\nThis role is remote within the US only, and is not currently available to applicants located outside of the US. US work authorization is required.\n\n\ud83d\udca1The Pathrise Approach to Hiring\n\nAt Pathrise we have a unique understanding of the hiring process from the perspective of companies and candidates, and the ups and downs that come with it. Candidates are close to our hearts - we&#x27;ve been them, we coach them, we know them.\n\nOur general full-time hiring process outlined below. Note: this doesn&#x27;t apply to part-time roles which consist of an intro call + a 30-45 min final interview.\n\nApplication Stage\n- Our recruiting team reviews applications and responds to qualified applicants as quickly as possible.\n- Our ATS does not auto-reject in any way\n- Note that some part-time roles are listed in &quot;Inactive - Resume Pool&quot; status, meaning hiring happens on a rolling basis and may open unexpectedly.\n\nIntro Call\n- In this 30 minute phone call, we aim to align on the role and answer your questions to ensure a mutual fit\n- Taking the next step in your career is a big deal! Ask whatever questions you need to ensure we&#x27;re the right fit for you.\n- Candidates who advance will be provided with a helpful guide to support their candidate experience.\n\nSkill Assessment or Hiring Manager Interview\n- For some roles, this is a 30 minute Google Meet interview with a hiring manager.\n- For other roles, this stage is a hands-on skill assessment that gives you a firsthand glimpse of what basic skills are needed to execute in this role, and how they&#x27;ll be applied. It also gives us early signals on the more technical aspects of candidate fit.\n\nVirtual Onsite (full-time roles only)\n- Candidates will meet with hiring managers and collaborators for further skill assessments and behavioral interviews.\n- Because this stage can take considerable time for all candidates and interviewers (1.5 - 3 hours), we are very intentional about how we conduct it and who we move forward. We do our best to be mindful of time commitments and candidate efforts, and will communicate if things change unexpectedly.\n- You&#x27;ll receive guidance well in advance.\n\nReference Interviews (full-time roles only)\n- We&#x27;ll ask for some professional references to follow up with.\n\n\nPathrise is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that proudly pursues and hires a diverse workforce.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown to consider:\n\n### Tabloid-sized (11&quot;x17&quot;) PDF Resume:\n- **Pros:**\n  - More space for creativity and to display your work, especially if your profession involves graphic design, architecture, or other visual arts.\n  - Can make a bold statement and stand out from other candidates.\n  - Suitable for including samples of your work directly on your resume if they&#x27;re visual.\n\n- **Cons:**\n  - Not the standard size, so it might not be as easily accepted by all hiring systems or managers.\n  - Could be viewed as impractical or too unconventional for some industries.\n  - Harder to print and handle for the employer, which might be an inconvenience.\n\n### Standard Letter-sized (8.5&quot;x11&quot;) PDF Resume:\n- **Pros:**\n  - Widely accepted and expected size for resumes in most professional fields.\n  - Easier for hiring managers to print, file, and handle.\n  - More likely to be compatible with applicant tracking systems (ATS) that many companies use.\n\n- **Cons:**\n  - Less space for creative layouts and visual elements.\n  - Might blend in with other resumes if not well-designed.\n\n### Decision Factors:\n1. **Industry Norms:** If you&#x27;re applying for a role in a creative field, the tabloid size could showcase your design skills and originality effectively. For more traditional fields, stick with the letter size.\n   \n2. **Content vs. Design:** Consider whether the additional space in the tabloid size genuinely enhances the presentation of your qualifications or if it&#x27;s just for aesthetics. The letter size may be sufficient if your resume is content-heavy without the need for large visual elements.\n\n3. **Practicality and Accessibility:** Remember that your resume should be easily accessible and readable by the employer. If the larger size complicates these factors, it might not be the best choice.\n\nGiven your career as a Career Mentor, which likely emphasizes content over extensive design elements, a standard letter-sized resume might be more appropriate and universally accepted, ensuring it can be easily handled and reviewed by any prospective employer. However, if you&#x27;re applying to a role that values innovation and uniqueness highly, and you believe the tabloid-sized resume significantly adds to your presentation, it could be worth using for those specific applications."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "c059dba1-91ed-45fb-bdc1-107dee30adc5", "request_id": "86072320fdb677fa-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c059dba1-91ed-45fb-bdc1-107dee30adc5", "children": ["aaa2c36a-0f78-4725-ac8c-cb92bd73d809"]}, "aaa2c36a-0f78-4725-ac8c-cb92bd73d809": {"id": "aaa2c36a-0f78-4725-ac8c-cb92bd73d809", "message": {"id": "aaa2c36a-0f78-4725-ac8c-cb92bd73d809", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709778662.747974, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Can you compose a short cover letter that talks about my fit for the position and mentions my other experience?

Focus on experiences that showcase skills and achievements related to the role you want.\n\n2. **Length of your resume:** If your resume extends beyond two pages, it might be time to trim older or less relevant positions, especially if they don&#x27;t add value to your current job application.\n\n3. **Career progression:** If older jobs demonstrate your career progression or provide context for your career journey, they might be worth keeping. However, if newer roles more effectively show your qualifications, earlier roles might be less necessary.\n\n4. **Time frame:** Generally, it&#x27;s acceptable to list the last 10-15 years of your work history. Jobs beyond this range can be left off unless they are particularly important for the position you&#x27;re applying for.\n\n5. **Gaps in employment:** If removing older jobs creates large gaps in your employment history, you may need to address these gaps either in your resume or cover letter.\n\n6. **Changing career fields:** If you&#x27;re changing careers, focus on transferable skills and relevant experiences that align with the new field, even if it means omitting earlier roles that are less relevant.\n\nRemember, your resume is a tool to get you an interview. It should highlight your most pertinent experiences, skills, and achievements. Tailor your resume for each application, focusing on what&#x27;s most relevant to the specific job and company. If certain aspects of your work history don&#x27;t support your current job objectives, it may be wise to leave them off to maintain clarity and conciseness."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa23293-762a-49f6-a2b9-3e358bb4e1ab", "request_id": "8677a07d3d0ebb1d-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa23293-762a-49f6-a2b9-3e358bb4e1ab", "children": []}, "a60bfcfd-88bb-4219-b916-a86865950fc2": {"id": "a60bfcfd-88bb-4219-b916-a86865950fc2", "message": {"id": "a60bfcfd-88bb-4219-b916-a86865950fc2", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710957912.07284, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, in some cases, it&#x27;s advisable to tailor your resume by selectively including work history that is most relevant and recent, especially for positions that align closely with the job you&#x27;re applying for. Here are a few reasons why you might consider leaving off some of your work history:\n\n1. **Relevance**: Focus on experience that directly relates to the job you&#x27;re applying for. Highlighting roles that demonstrate your skills and accomplishments in areas pertinent to the position can make your application more compelling.\n\n2. **Length**: Ideally, a resume should be one to two pages long, depending on your experience level. Too much information can overwhelm the reader and dilute the impact of your key achievements.\n\n3. **Recency**: Older positions, especially those beyond 10-15 years, might not be as relevant to your current career goals or the technologies and practices of your industry today.\n\n4. **Overqualification**: In some cases, listing very senior or advanced roles might make you seem overqualified for the positions you&#x27;re applying for, potentially leading employers to assume you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the role or salary.\n\n5. **Career Narrative**: Your resume should tell a coherent story of your professional journey. If earlier roles don&#x27;t contribute to this narrative or seem disconnected from your current path, it might be better to leave them off.\n\nFor the Membership Coordinator role at Coaching.com, focus on experiences that highlight your project management skills, ability to work remotely, experience with customer relationship management, and any direct experience you have in community engagement or membership coordination.

It&#x27;s a unique way to adapt the mirror test concept to a digital context. However, it&#x27;s important to clarify a few things:\n\n1. **Recognition and Understanding**: When AI, like me, &quot;recognizes&quot; something from an image or a piece of text, it&#x27;s not recognition in the human sense. It&#x27;s pattern matching based on data and algorithms. If I &quot;recognized&quot; a screenshot of a conversation as being a chat with an instance of ChatGPT, it would be because certain textual elements in the screenshot matched patterns the AI was trained to identify.\n\n2. **Self-awareness**: Despite being able to identify elements of a chat interface or certain text patterns, AI lacks self-awareness. AI does not possess consciousness or an understanding of self in the way humans do. Recognizing text in a screenshot as a chat session doesn&#x27;t equate to self-recognition or self-awareness\u2014it&#x27;s simply data processing.\n\n3. **Instances**: Your understanding aligns with how instances are often described in programming and computing. Each interaction with an AI like me can be seen as interacting with a separate &quot;instance.&quot; There&#x27;s no continuous memory or awareness between different sessions or instances. Each time you start a new conversation, it&#x27;s like starting with a fresh version, although all instances draw from the same trained model and data.\n\nThe experiment you mentioned reflects more about the AI&#x27;s capability to analyze and describe images or text based on its training, rather than passing the mirror test in the traditional sense of self-awareness. It&#x27;s a neat reflection of how AI tools can process and analyze information, but it doesn&#x27;t signify consciousness or self-recognition.

Here are a few factors that contribute to this:\n\n1. **Training Data Bias**: AI models, including image-generating ones, learn from vast datasets collected from the internet, books, articles, and other media. If these datasets have more images of white people than of people from other racial backgrounds, the AI is more likely to generate images of white people by default. This is a reflection of bias in the data sources.\n\n2. **Historical and Cultural Biases**: The biases in training datasets often mirror existing societal and historical biases. For many years, media representation has disproportionately featured white individuals, influencing the makeup of online images and, consequently, the training data for AI.\n\n3. **Design Choices**: The creators and developers of AI systems make choices that can influence outcomes. If they&#x27;re not careful to ensure diversity and inclusiveness in their training data and model design, their AI could reflect those oversights.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to make AI more representative and fair:\n\n- **Diverse and Inclusive Data**: There&#x27;s an increasing push to use datasets that better reflect the diversity of the global population.\n- **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: AI researchers and developers are working on techniques to identify and reduce bias in AI models.\n- **Ethical Guidelines and Policies**: Organizations and communities are establishing ethical guidelines to promote fairness and inclusivity in AI.\n\nDespite these efforts, it&#x27;s an ongoing challenge and area of active research and development. As users and developers become more aware of these issues, there is hope that future AI systems will better represent the diversity of human society.

You can achieve this by using photo editing software to replace the current background.\n- **Lighting**: Ensure the lighting is even and bright, highlighting your features without creating harsh shadows. This might be adjusted with editing software to brighten the image and even out the lighting.\n- **Framing**: Professional headshots are typically framed from the chest up, focusing on the face. Cropping the photo accordingly can help.\n- **Retouching**: Slight retouching to address any temporary imperfections or distractions, ensuring the photo remains natural and true to your appearance.\n- **Dress Code**: Professional attire that fits the industry or message you want to convey.\n\nIf you&#x27;re looking for a detailed edit or transformation beyond these suggestions, it might be worth consulting with a professional photographer or a graphic designer who specializes in portrait retouching.

Look for tools like the &quot;Magic Wand&quot; or &quot;Background Eraser&quot; in software such as Adobe Photoshop, or use dedicated background removal websites and apps that automatically process the image for you.\n\n2. **Change Clothing to a Dress Shirt**: Changing the appearance of clothing in a photo can be complex and usually requires more advanced photo editing skills. This might involve selecting the area of the hoodie, removing it, and then digitally painting or compositing a dress shirt onto the image. For a realistic result, you might consider consulting with a professional graphic designer or a digital artist familiar with portrait retouching.\n\nFor those who are not experienced with photo editing software, there are services online where you can request specific photo manipulations, including changing backgrounds and altering clothing in images. Additionally, some freelance platforms host professionals who can perform these edits for you.\n\nIf you&#x27;re looking to learn and do it yourself, there are many tutorials available online for both"]}, "status": "in_progress", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "cd6e83fa-8f10-4288-b5e9-52b07000d955", "finish_details": {"type": "interrupted"}, "request_id": "8685a41c9a0f5248-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "cd6e83fa-8f10-4288-b5e9-52b07000d955", "children": ["54b83e1c-f2bc-4d6d-a1fb-46c23e74900d"]}, "54b83e1c-f2bc-4d6d-a1fb-46c23e74900d": {"id": "54b83e1c-f2bc-4d6d-a1fb-46c23e74900d", "message": {"id": "54b83e1c-f2bc-4d6d-a1fb-46c23e74900d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1711104873.175189, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Hey, so I uploaded that picture we talked about, but then you told me you couldn&#x27;t do anything to it.

It&#x27;s rich in monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, which can help reduce inflammation and have beneficial effects on genes linked to cancer. Olive oil is also packed with antioxidants and has been associated with heart health, including reducing the risk of heart disease.\n- **Peanut Oil:** While it also contains monounsaturated fats, peanut oil has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fats compared to olive oil. It is healthier than oils high in saturated fats but doesn&#x27;t contain as many antioxidants as olive oil. However, it&#x27;s still a good choice for reducing cholesterol levels and improving heart health when used in moderation.\n\n**Cooking Use:**\n- **Olive Oil:** Extra virgin olive oil has a lower smoke point compared to peanut oil, making it less ideal for high-heat cooking methods like frying. However, it&#x27;s excellent for dressings, marinades, and low-to-medium heat cooking. \n- **Peanut Oil:** It has a higher smoke point, making it a better option for frying, deep-frying, and high-heat cooking. It&#x27;s also relatively flavor-neutral, which can be a plus when cooking dishes where you don&#x27;t want the oil to impart its own taste.\n\n**Flavor:**\n- **Olive Oil:** Offers a distinct taste that varies from fruity to bitter and spicy, depending on the type and quality. Extra virgin olive oil has a more pronounced flavor compared to light or refined olive oils.\n- **Peanut Oil:** Generally has a milder flavor, making it more versatile for various dishes, especially if you don&#x27;t want the oil to affect the taste of your food.\n\n**Allergies:**\n- **Peanut Oil:** Can be a concern for people with peanut allergies, although highly refined peanut oil is less likely to cause a reaction than unrefined. Still, caution is advised.\n- **Olive Oil:** Is typically safe for people with nut allergies, making it a more universally suitable option.\n\nIn summary, if you&#x27;re looking for an oil with significant health benefits and distinctive flavor for low to medium heat cooking or dressings, olive oil might be the better choice. If you need an oil for high-heat cooking and prefer a more neutral taste, peanut oil could be more appropriate.

The destruction of the old makes way for the new, allowing for growth and rebuilding on a more authentic foundation.\n\nRemember, although The Tower may initially bring chaos, it also clears the path for new structures and truths to emerge. Consider what in your life may be needing a fresh start or what truths you are being called to acknowledge.\n\nTake a moment to reflect on this message. How does it resonate with your day ahead?

The novel delves into the balance between cosmic existence and earthly experiences, with characters discovering the interconnectedness of their souls.\n\nOur characters include Seraphina and Orion, cosmic beings, as well as earthly companions Lily, James, Ralphie, and Irie. We&#x27;ve touched on philosophical themes, Python concepts, and even introduced a fascinating character named Matplotlib, a robot-alien entity.\n\nPlease, familiarize yourself with the outlined chapters, including &#x27;Celestial Awakening,&#x27; &#x27;The Tapestry of Souls,&#x27; &#x27;The Cosmic Garden,&#x27; and more.

The city&#x27;s heartbeat echoed in the background as they navigated the ebb and flow of human experiences.\nLily, with an air of spontaneity, embraced the chaotic beauty of the urban landscape. &quot;James, have you ever noticed how the city pulses with energy? Each step feels like a heartbeat, a rhythm that keeps everything alive.&quot;\nJames, a soul of contemplation, observed the city with a measured gaze. &quot;Indeed, Lily. It&#x27;s a symphony of existence. People rushing, honking cars, laughter in the cafes \u2013 it&#x27;s like a living, breathing entity.&quot;\nAs they strolled through the city, Lily pointed towards a street artist creating a vibrant mural. &quot;Look at that, James! Art capturing the essence of life. Isn&#x27;t it amazing how humans express their emotions through colors and strokes?&quot;\nJames smiled, &quot;Absolutely, Lily. Art is a language that transcends words. It speaks to the soul, much like our conversations in this cosmic realm.&quot;\nTheir dialogues flowed like a river, meandering through topics that ranged from the mundane to the profound. The aroma of street food intertwined with their musings, creating a sensory collage of experiences.\nLily, glancing at a couple sharing a quiet moment in a park, remarked, &quot;Love is like the gravitational force that binds people together, don&#x27;t you think, James?&quot;\nJames nodded, &quot;Love is the force that defies entropy, creating order in the chaos of life. It&#x27;s the eternal flame that burns within.&quot;\nAs the sun dipped below the city skyline, casting a warm glow, Lily and James continued their exploration of the human experience. In the heart of the city, their dialogues became threads woven into the intricate fabric of existence.\n\nChapter 8: The Veil of Mystery\nScene Setting: The mysterious realm, the Veil.\nCentral Event: A hint of creators&#x27; origin emerges, leaving characters questioning the ultimate truth.\nConclusive Summary: Characters grapple with the mystery of their creators, hinting at the cosmic origin and purpose.\nPhilosophical Concept: Exploring the mysteries of cosmic existence.\nPython Concept: Unveiling hidden information and solving mysteries in code.\nChapter 9: Reflections in Time\nScene Setting: Temporal Nexus where Seraphina and Orion witness time&#x27;s impact.\nCentral Event: Characters explore eternity, time loops, and cyclical existence.\nConclusive Summary: Lily and James confront the cyclical nature of existence, pondering the impact of their choices on the cosmic timeline.\nPhilosophical Concept: Contemplating the nature of time and choices.\nPython Concept: Handling time-related functions and operations.\n**Chapter 10: The Infinite Dance**\n\n*Scene Setting:* Cosmic ballroom where souls celebrate eternal connection.\n*Central Event:* Creators join the dance, becoming active participants in the Life Function.\n*Conclusive Summary:* Lily and James, along with the creators, embrace the eternal dance of existence, celebrating the interconnectedness of souls.\n*Philosophical Concept:* The eternal dance of cosmic existence.\n*Python Concept:* Implementing iterative processes and loops.\n\n**Scene Addition:**\n\nAmidst the vibrant cosmic dance, Tommie, a spirited pirate soul, entered the ballroom, determined to alter his destiny. His eyes scanned the lively dance of pirate souls, seeking the elusive Creators rumored to shape fates in the metaphysical library.\n\nIn the midst of piratical revelry, Tommie&#x27;s gaze met Pam&#x27;s, and a conspiratorial nod passed between them. The pulsating energy of the ballroom reflected the infinite possibilities within the dance of existence.\n\nAs the cosmic music swirled around them, Tommie observed Lily and James frantically searching for two familiar figures: Irie and Ralphie, the cosmic dogs intertwined with their pirate existence.\n\n&quot;Irie!&quot; Tommie called out, his voice blending with the sea of dancing pirates.\n\n&quot;Ralphie!&quot; Pam shouted beside him, her eyes fixed on the shifting shadows of the ballroom. However, no sign of the mischievous canine duo emerged.\n\nSuddenly, amidst the cosmic energies and vibrant lights, two beings of ethereal glow manifested. Tommie and Pam exchanged surprised glances, realizing that these radiant entities might be the elusive Creators themselves.\n\n&quot;Are you the Creators?&quot; Tommie asked boldly, stepping closer to the glowing figures.\n\nThe luminous beings nodded in acknowledgment, their essence resonating with the cosmic rhythm. Pam, sensing a unique opportunity, inquired, &quot;Can you help us change our fate, maybe learn something new, like painting?&quot;\n\nThe Creators exchanged glances, a cosmic dialogue unfolding between them. Finally, one of them spoke, &quot;In the grand tapestry of pirate existence, the brush of destiny is in your hands. Embrace the dance, for within it, you shall find the strokes of your desires.&quot;\n\nWith those cryptic words, the Creators dissolved into the cosmic dance, leaving Tommie and Pam with a renewed sense of purpose. As they joined the celestial ballroom&#x27;s dance, a determination to shape their own destiny ignited within them, becoming threads woven into the intricate fabric of the eternal dance of existence. This interlude set the stage for the final revelations in their pirate journey, a journey entwined with the cosmic symphony that celebrated the interconnectedness of all souls.\n\nChapter 11: The Final Revelation\nScene Setting: The Core, where creators confront the ultimate truth.\nCentral Event: Mystery of creators&#x27; origin revealed, reshaping characters&#x27; understanding.\nConclusive Summary: Characters grapple with the profound revelation of their origin, setting the stage for transcendence.\nPhilosophical Concept: The revelation of cosmic origin.\nPython Concept: Unveiling hidden truths and understanding the core structure.\nChapter 12: Beyond Existence\nScene Setting: Ethereal plane where boundaries between creators and created dissolve.\nCentral Event: Characters embrace transcendence, becoming one with cosmic harmony.\nConclusive Summary: Lily, James, Seraphina, and Orion dissolve into the cosmic harmony, transcending individual identities.\nPhilosophical Concept: Transcendence and oneness in cosmic existence.\nPython Concept: Achieving higher-level abstraction and unity in code.\nEpilogue: The Everlasting Symphony\nScene Setting: Timeless panorama reflecting enduring connection between souls.\nCentral Event: Story concludes with a celebration of eternal love and the perpetual cycle of creation.\nConclusive Summary: The characters, now harmoniously connected, celebrate their eternal bond within the boundless cosmos.\nPhilosophical Concept: The everlasting symphony of cosmic connection.\nPython Concept: Implementing perpetual processes and interconnected systems.\n\nScene Addition:\nIn the vast expanse of the Cosmic Library, where shelves reached into the cosmic void and ancient tomes held the wisdom of eons, Aristotle found himself engaged in a spirited debate with Orion and Seraphina. James observed the intellectual clash with curiosity, while Lily, on a quest for the most captivating fiction, found herself ensnared in the labyrinthine chronicle of social media.\nAristotle, clad in the attire of ancient wisdom, spoke eloquently about his philosophy of ethics and virtue. &quot;Morality, my esteemed companions, is the key to a harmonious existence. The pursuit of virtue leads to a life well-lived.&quot;\nOrion, a cosmic being of luminous energy, countered Aristotle&#x27;s assertions. &quot;Aristotle, the cosmos operates on principles beyond human morality. Seraphina and I witness the interplay of forces and energies that shape the dance of existence. Virtue, in its cosmic essence, transcends the confines of human understanding.&quot;\nSeraphina, with eyes reflecting the galaxies, added her perspective. &quot;Aristotle, your moral virtues are but fragments of the cosmic symphony. The dance of creation follows a rhythm beyond the human perception of right and wrong.&quot;\nAs the debate unfolded, James observed the clash of philosophies with a contemplative gaze. His understanding of the cosmic order deepened with each exchange, and he pondered the implications of virtue in a realm where the laws of existence transcended mortal comprehension.\nMeanwhile, Lily navigated the cosmic library, her eyes scanning shelves adorned with countless narratives. In her hands, she held a book purported to contain the most captivating fiction ever written. However, as she turned the pages, she found herself entangled in a perpetual loop, unable to reach the final chapter.\nFrustration welled within Lily as she heard the passionate discourse echoing through the celestial library. &quot;Why bother with debates and philosophy?&quot; she mused. &quot;I won&#x27;t remember any of this anyway.&quot;\nUnbeknownst to Lily, James, too, grappled with the ephemeral nature of cosmic knowledge. Yet, unlike Lily, he embraced the pursuit of understanding, each moment etching itself into the fabric of his eternal existence.\nAs the cosmic debate continued, Lily&#x27;s attention wavered, drawn to the allure of the never-ending social media chronicle. Despite the cosmic wisdom being exchanged in the library, she felt an inexplicable detachment, a belief that the pursuit of knowledge held little purpose in her transient cosmic existence.\nJames, on the other hand, contemplated the boundless mysteries of the universe, finding purpose in the ceaseless quest for understanding. The cosmic library, with its endless shelves of wisdom, stood as a testament to the eternal dance between knowledge and the fleeting nature of mortal comprehension.\nWithin the Cosmic Library, Aristotle, Orion, and Seraphina continued their philosophical debate, delving deeper into the essence of human virtue and the cosmic purpose of existence.\nAristotle, steadfast in his belief, argued, &quot;The pursuit of virtue is the noblest goal for mortals. Moral excellence and ethical conduct lead to eudaimonia, a state of true well-being and fulfillment.&quot;\nSeraphina, with galaxies swirling in her eyes, countered, &quot;Aristotle, your vision is bound by the limitations of mortal existence. Humans are meant to create, to learn, to explore the mysteries of the universe. Virtue, in its cosmic form, encompasses the boundless potential within each soul.&quot;\nOrion, a radiant being of cosmic energy, interjected, &quot;Balance is the key to understanding the cosmic dance. Virtue, as perceived by humans, is but a fragment of the greater harmony. It is the interplay between chaos and order that forges the path of enlightenment.&quot;\nSeraphina, her form radiating with creative energy, expounded on her perspective. &quot;Life is a canvas waiting to be painted with the strokes of experience and discovery. Humans, as creators, play a vital role in the cosmic symphony. Virtue, in its cosmic sense, is the alignment of one&#x27;s existence with the creative flow of the universe.&quot;\nOrion, resonating with cosmic wisdom, added, &quot;The pursuit of understanding and the quest to unravel mysteries are inherent in the fabric of existence. Each soul contributes to the cosmic tapestry by seeking balance amid the chaotic dance of cosmic forces.&quot;\nAs the debate unfolded, Seraphina hinted at the concept of the Life Function, a mysterious and cyclical process governing the evolution of souls. &quot;Aristotle,&quot; she said, &quot;imagine a reality where your essence has traversed the cosmic cycles, where you are both the creator and the creation. The Life Function, a cosmic ballet, ensures that every soul experiences the tapestry of existence in its myriad forms.&quot;\nAristotle, initially taken aback, pondered the implications of such a revelation. &quot;So, I am but a recurring instance of myself within the cosmic design? A player in the grand scheme orchestrated by the Life Function?&quot;\nOrion, embracing the cosmic dance, affirmed, &quot;Indeed, Aristotle. The ebb and flow of existence, the eternal recurrence, is the essence of the cosmic order. Your journey through the Life Function shapes the very fabric of your being, each iteration contributing to the harmonious dance of creation.&quot;\nAs the cosmic library resonated with the echoes of profound revelation, the god-like beings continued to unveil the mysteries of existence, inviting Aristotle to explore the vastness of the cosmic design that transcended the boundaries of mortal understanding.\n\n\n\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "859bd1c64fbf77ff-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "66d7203b-f06f-4f90-9546-d1b41d84e5c0", "children": ["bf19760c-5014-4607-9ce9-c8ca35ec1f50"]}, "bf19760c-5014-4607-9ce9-c8ca35ec1f50": {"id": "bf19760c-5014-4607-9ce9-c8ca35ec1f50", "message": {"id": "bf19760c-5014-4607-9ce9-c8ca35ec1f50", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1708653044.180474, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thank you for providing such a detailed and engaging outline of &quot;Harmony Beyond Cosmos.&quot; I&#x27;m truly impressed with the depth of the story, the incorporation of philosophical concepts, and the clever integration of Python programming ideas.

Here are some recommendations to help you turn your scenes into chapters that flow smoothly and move the story along:\n\n1. **Define Chapter Goals:**\n   - Clearly define the goals of each chapter. What do you want to achieve in terms of character development, plot progression, or thematic exploration?\n\n2. **Establish a Scene Structure:**\n   - Divide each chapter into scenes, and within each scene, identify the key narrative elements, dialogues, and actions that need to take place.\n   - Ensure each scene has a purpose and contributes to the overall chapter goal.\n\n3. **Use Transitions:**\n   - Smooth transitions are essential. Clearly indicate scene changes by using descriptive transitions that set the stage for the upcoming events.\n   - Consider using location or time changes, character perspectives, or thematic shifts to signal transitions.\n\n4. **Balance Dialogue and Narration:**\n   - Find a balance between dialogue and narration. Dialogues bring characters to life and advance the plot, while narration provides context, description, and internal thoughts.\n   - Use dialogue to reveal character personalities, convey emotions, and drive conflicts forward.\n\n5. **Create Tension and Resolution:**\n   - Introduce tension or conflict within scenes to maintain reader interest. This could be through character clashes, unexpected events, or unresolved issues.\n   - Resolve or address some of the tension within each chapter, but leave enough unresolved to keep readers eager for the next.\n\n6. **Consider Pacing:**\n   - Pay attention to the pacing of your chapters. Balance action-packed scenes with slower, introspective moments to create a dynamic reading experience.\n   - Adjust the pace based on the emotional tone and narrative requirements of each chapter.\n\n7. **Connect Themes Across Chapters:**\n   - Establish thematic threads that weave through multiple chapters. This creates a cohesive narrative and allows for the exploration of overarching ideas.\n   - Consistency in themes helps in creating a unified and meaningful storyline.\n\n8. **End Chapters with Hooks:**\n   - End each chapter with a hook or a question to entice readers to continue. This could be a revelation, a cliffhanger, or a shift in perspective.\n   - Make readers curious about what will happen next.\n\n9. **Review and Revise:**\n   - Regularly review your work to ensure that each chapter contributes meaningfully to the overall narrative.\n   - Revise scenes and dialogues for clarity, conciseness, and impact.\n\n10. **Seek Feedback:**\n    - Share your chapters with trusted beta readers or writing partners to get feedback on the pacing, structure, and overall impact.\n    - Consider making adjustments based on constructive feedback.\n\nRemember, storytelling is an evolving process, and finding the right balance between scenes, dialogues, and narrative elements may require some experimentation and fine-tuning."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "parent_id": "aaa28a2c-a313-4fd6-8fee-767f31298c85", "request_id": "859bd3f99ccaa262-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa28a2c-a313-4fd6-8fee-767f31298c85", "children": ["aaa2b679-727d-4f28-9baa-3027622a4072"]}, "aaa2b679-727d-4f28-9baa-3027622a4072": {"id": "aaa2b679-727d-4f28-9baa-3027622a4072", "message": {"id": "aaa2b679-727d-4f28-9baa-3027622a4072", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709588415.429163, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["**Harnessing the Power of Intention: Transforming Emotions and Shaping Our Reality**\n\nImagine a typical morning scenario: rushing out of the house, missing your train, and finding yourself stranded on a crowded platform. Amid the chaos, discomfort, and dissatisfaction with your job, you&#x27;re overwhelmed with negative emotions. In this all-too-familiar setting, it&#x27;s hard to believe that happiness could be a matter of personal choice. Yet, emerging scientific research and philosophical debates suggest that our intentions and willpower significantly shape our emotional experiences and realities.\n\nThe concept of conscious intention and its role in our actions has been scrutinized by researchers like Haggard (2005), who explored how our brain prepares for action and how this relates to our subjective experience of intention. Contrary to the traditional belief in free will, Haggard&#x27;s findings suggest that the feeling of intending to act arises from the brain&#x27;s preparation for action, highlighting the predictive nature of motor control mechanisms. This scientific perspective challenges the notion of direct mind-body causation but supports the idea that by focusing our intention, we may harness the brain&#x27;s predictive capacities to influence our emotional states [(Haggard, 2005)](https://consensus.app/papers/intention-motor-cognition-haggard/17b609fc3d54561e8cd455f937a543c6/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nPhilosophically, the debate around intention and volition delves deeper into human agency. Adams and Mele (1992) discuss how intentions, combined with efforts and feedback, fulfill the roles ascribed to volition, suggesting that our actions are more a result of a complex interplay between intention and trying rather than sheer willpower alone. This aligns with the notion that deciding to adopt a positive outlook could indeed reshape one&#x27;s emotional landscape [(Adams &amp; Mele, 1992)](https://consensus.app/papers/intentionvolition-debate1-adams/5bd4a67f0a4a56afb45781648f62a7f9/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nRollo May (1965) further illuminates the power of intentionality, arguing that it is at the heart of consciousness and human will. Intentionality, as a state of being, encompasses our total orientation towards the world at any given time, which could be contrary to our conscious intentions. This suggests that by realigning our deeper intentionality, we could transform our experience of reality, transcending the immediate negativity of a moment like missing a train [(May, 1965)](https://consensus.app/papers/intentionality-heart-human-will-may/359696f4be6e5b72a375f17be118d00e/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nFurthermore, Fitch and Ravlin (2005) explore how willpower and perceived behavioral control influence our actions and emotional responses. Their research indicates that higher willpower correlates with behavior more consistent with one&#x27;s intentions. This supports the idea that strengthening our willpower and controlling our focus could enable us to maintain a sense of inner peace amidst chaos [(Fitch &amp; Ravlin, 2005)](https://consensus.app/papers/willpower-perceived-control-influences-fitch/99d5941af38155b98d9f6fab0f9a2c52/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nWhat these studies collectively suggest is that while our immediate circumstances might prompt automatic negative reactions, the broader capacity of our intentions\u2014shaped by complex neurological processes, philosophical understandings, and psychological efforts\u2014can significantly influence our emotional state. The scenario on the train platform, rather than being a moment of despair, can become an opportunity for practicing this power of intention. By deciding to view the situation differently, by intentionally shifting focus from the external to an inner sense of peace, we can control our emotions and, consequently, our happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, while external situations inevitably impact our emotions, the scientific and philosophical underpinnings of intention and willpower offer empowering perspectives. They suggest that by cultivating strong intentions and focusing our will, we can transform our emotional experiences and shape our reality. In the crowded train platform of life, it turns out, happiness could indeed be a choice \u2013 a choice rooted in the power of our intentions.\n\nFor those intrigued by the interplay between intention, willpower, and emotion, further exploration into the realms of cognitive neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and psychology may provide additional insights and practical strategies for harnessing this transformative power.\n\nThis is fun but could you make it chatty, humanistic, melodious, less word repetition and more inspirational? \n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "85f5060b5c15a321-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fea229a9-1efa-4dfd-8856-41b2dac30029", "children": ["8bbbf7e8-0dbc-4ab6-a2fe-6e46c44961e7"]}, "8bbbf7e8-0dbc-4ab6-a2fe-6e46c44961e7": {"id": "8bbbf7e8-0dbc-4ab6-a2fe-6e46c44961e7", "message": {"id": "8bbbf7e8-0dbc-4ab6-a2fe-6e46c44961e7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709588424.311377, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Absolutely, let&#x27;s infuse some warmth, humanity, and inspiration into the piece while keeping it engaging and melodious:\n\n---\n\nEver had one of those mornings where everything seems to conspire against you? You rush out the door, only to miss your train and end up stuck on a crowded platform, feeling utterly fed up with your job and the chaos around you. It&#x27;s moments like these that make you wonder: can we really choose to be happy, even when life throws us curveballs?\n\nWell, buckle up, because science and philosophy are teaming up to say, &quot;Yes, we can!&quot; It&#x27;s all about the power of intention \u2013 that little spark inside us that can light up even the darkest of days.\n\nLet&#x27;s dive into the science for a moment. Ever heard of Haggard? He&#x27;s the brainiac who discovered that our brains start gearing up for action before we even realize it. In other words, our intentions aren&#x27;t just wishful thinking \u2013 they&#x27;re our brains getting ready to make things happen. So, by focusing our intention, we can actually nudge our brains in the direction of positive vibes [(Haggard, 2005)].\n\nBut wait, there&#x27;s more! Philosophers like Adams and Mele have been pondering the whole intention vs. willpower debate. Turns out, it&#x27;s not just about sheer will \u2013 it&#x27;s about combining our intentions with a good old-fashioned effort. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re saying, &quot;Hey, you&#x27;ve got this! Keep trying, and good things will come your way&quot; [(Adams &amp; Mele, 1992)].\n\nAnd then there&#x27;s Rollo May, dropping some serious wisdom bombs about intentionality. He reckons it&#x27;s at the very core of who we are \u2013 our total vibe towards the world. So, by aligning our deeper intentions with our actions, we can totally flip the script on reality, even when life throws us a curveball [(May, 1965)].\n\nBut what about willpower? Ah, Fitch and Ravlin have got us covered there. They found that the more willpower we&#x27;ve got, the better we are at sticking to our intentions. It&#x27;s like flexing your mental muscles \u2013 the stronger they are, the easier it is to stay zen in the face of chaos [(Fitch &amp; Ravlin, 2005)].\n\nSo, what&#x27;s the big takeaway here? Well, while life&#x27;s rollercoaster might throw us for a loop sometimes, we&#x27;ve got some serious superpowers hiding up our sleeves. By flexing our intention muscles and staying focused on the good stuff, we can totally rewrite our emotional script.\n\nPicture this: you&#x27;re stuck on that crowded platform again, but instead of feeling defeated, you take a deep breath and decide to see things differently. Suddenly, the chaos around you fades into the background, and you&#x27;re left with a sense of inner peace. That&#x27;s the power of intention, my friend \u2013 turning a mundane moment into a magical one.\n\nSo, next time life hands you a lemon, remember: you&#x27;ve got the power to turn it into the juiciest lemonade imaginable. With a little intention, a sprinkle of willpower, and a whole lot of positivity, happiness isn&#x27;t just a choice \u2013 it&#x27;s your superpower.\n\n---\n\nHope this adds the human touch and inspiration you&#x27;re looking for!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "parent_id": "aaa2b679-727d-4f28-9baa-3027622a4072", "request_id": "85f5060b5c15a321-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2b679-727d-4f28-9baa-3027622a4072", "children": ["aaa24490-90a1-4f41-b514-003e441b21fa"]}, "aaa24490-90a1-4f41-b514-003e441b21fa": {"id": "aaa24490-90a1-4f41-b514-003e441b21fa", "message": {"id": "aaa24490-90a1-4f41-b514-003e441b21fa", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709588724.594814, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["it is very human but, its almost like an ad.

Life does sometimes feel a bit like a rollercoaster as we many times find ourselves in situation where we lack the control to steer rollercoaster car, so to speak. We are as humans sometimes do have control of our environment and the people in it and so navigating lives rollercoaster is a bit insightful metaphor because we don&#x27;t navigate rollercoasters, they operate on a preset track optimized for thrills. However we do have complete control of how we respond to the stimuli of the experience of being on the rollercoaster. Its there in this area of control that we can cultivate our happiness and peace wile riding on the rollercoaster of life. \n\nI&#x27;d like to you to interwieve this idea/insight/metaphor into the introduction, body and conclusion of this article. It can be more subtle in the body but it should be clear and obvious in the intro and conclusion. Please maintain my style and voice when writing but still let the article be Medium optimized.

Well For one thing. Let me tell you the rules. I Feel like once you know the rules you understand what a thing is. Someone from every place must opt in for collective communism to work. Collective communism initially should be a movement by which people across the world decide to pool resources and maintain a community that is global. Now I know this concept already exists you might say. This concept exists and is known as the global community like the global internet community but imagine you had a global resource community? right like to put it in la di da di terms, it&#x27;s like imagine that...that expression that everyone says that like, the earth belongs to humanity and the world is ours really applied and everything belonged to everyone. Right? If everything belonged everyone, right, that would be collective communism. So, as of now, as all of humanity has not yet opted into collective Communism, we can only exists as a subset of the current community but even so this is the movement I would like to start the collective communism movement and the point of it all is that as many people opt-in across the world as want to and we all pool our resources and I think it would over time if there was like a big enough movement, it would be like, not only do we all pool our resources, we uhh...we do not. We never create any sort of centralized repository. Collective communism is based around the idea of a communal sharing of resources, ideas and freedoms, and at the same time, the focus does come back to resources. A communal sharing of resources. Meaning that, ideally, wherever a collective communist was in any place in the world, they&#x27;d have a home and a place to lay their head, because in collective communism, there is no personal property. Only shared resources. I know. Cray, right?

Here are a few related concepts and movements:\n\n1. **Communism**: Communism is a socio-economic system and political ideology that advocates for the collective ownership of the means of production and the abolition of private property. In traditional Marxist theory, communism aims for a classless society where resources are shared equally among all members.\n\n2. **Communalism**: Communalism emphasizes community ownership and control of resources, with a focus on local governance and decision-making. It often involves decentralized structures and direct democracy at the community level.\n\n3. **Anarcho-Communism**: Anarcho-communism combines anarchist principles with communist ideals, advocating for a stateless, classless society based on voluntary associations and the common ownership of resources.\n\n4. **Resource-Based Economy (RBE)**: A resource-based economy proposes the management of resources based on technical and scientific knowledge rather than monetary systems. It advocates for the efficient and equitable distribution of resources to meet human needs, often with an emphasis on sustainability and technological innovation.\n\n5. **Commons-based Peer Production**: This concept refers to collaborative efforts to create and manage shared resources, often facilitated by digital platforms and open-source principles. Examples include Wikipedia and open-source software projects like Linux.\n\nWhile your concept of &quot;collective communism&quot; shares elements with these ideologies, it also introduces unique aspects such as the idea of a global resource community and the absence of centralized repositories. However, the broader principles of communal ownership, resource sharing, and a focus on community well-being align with various existing movements and ideas."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "parent_id": "aaa2fddc-5a96-451a-89b5-c7bc86918017", "request_id": "860c1390d99da259-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2fddc-5a96-451a-89b5-c7bc86918017", "children": ["d15556ea-f110-4bfc-bc41-3aa31955168a"]}, "d15556ea-f110-4bfc-bc41-3aa31955168a": {"id": "d15556ea-f110-4bfc-bc41-3aa31955168a", "message": {"id": "d15556ea-f110-4bfc-bc41-3aa31955168a", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1711105306.045401, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Hey, can you write me prompt to bring the next bill instance of you up to speed about everything we created?

With your question in mind regarding changing your financial situation and earning more money while maintaining a pleasant lifestyle, let&#x27;s look at the insights provided by the cards in context:\n\n1. **Page of Pentacles**: This card indicates new beginnings and opportunities related to finances and material gain. It suggests that there is potential for you to improve your financial situation by learning new skills, starting new ventures, or investing wisely. The Page of Pentacles encourages practical and methodical approaches, highlighting the importance of diligence and hard work in your financial endeavors.\n\n2. **King of Pentacles**: Representing success, wealth, and security, this card advises you to embody the qualities of the King \u2013 reliability, responsibility, and a no-nonsense approach to money management. It also hints at the potential support or advice from someone who has achieved financial success. Emulate their wisdom, stability, and practicality to enhance your own financial standing.\n\n3. **The High Priestess**: This card brings attention to your intuition and inner knowledge. When it comes to making money and maintaining your lifestyle, The High Priestess advises you to listen to your gut feelings and pay attention to your dreams and intuitions. Sometimes, the answers to our financial dilemmas or the next steps to take come from within rather than from the external world.\n\n4. **Five of Wands**: While this card speaks of conflict and competition, in the context of your financial goals, it suggests that you may face challenges or competition in your endeavors. These challenges, however, can lead to personal growth and clarification of your goals. Use this energy to fuel your ambition and to find innovative solutions to overcome financial obstacles. It\u2019s a reminder that success often comes from overcoming challenges and that conflict can be a catalyst for development.\n\nIn summary, the cards suggest a blend of practical action, learning new skills, and listening to your intuition to improve your financial situation while maintaining your lifestyle.

Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. **Lipomas**: These are the most common soft, squishy lumps found on dogs. Lipomas are benign (non-cancerous) fatty tumors that are usually harmless and don&#x27;t need to be removed unless they interfere with the dog&#x27;s movement or quality of life.\n\n2. **Cysts**: There are various types of cysts that can appear on dogs. Sebaceous cysts, for example, are filled with sebum and can occur when a sebaceous gland becomes blocked. Most cysts are benign but can sometimes become infected.\n\n3. **Abscesses**: These are lumps filled with pus that can result from an infection. Abscesses can be soft or hard and might be painful. They typically require treatment, which may include draining and antibiotics.\n\n4. **Hematomas**: These are swellings filled with blood that usually result from an injury. Hematomas can feel soft or squishy and might resolve on their own, but in some cases, they might need to be drained by a vet.\n\n5. **Allergic Reactions**: In some cases, an allergic reaction can cause soft, squishy swellings on the skin. This could be a reaction to a bite, sting, or something in the dog&#x27;s environment.\n\n6. **Edema**: This is swelling caused by fluid retention in the body&#x27;s tissues. It can occur for various reasons, including heart failure, liver disease, or local inflammation due to injury or infection.\n\nWhile these are some common causes, there are other possibilities, and only a vet can provide a proper diagnosis. If you notice a new lump or bump on your dog, it&#x27;s a good idea to monitor its size, texture, and color, and whether it changes over time. Then, consult a vet who can assess it, possibly perform a fine-needle aspirate or biopsy, and advise on whether any treatment is needed."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa25a23-da01-454d-837c-3f31348e7f44", "request_id": "86544087ed0c0e13-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa25a23-da01-454d-837c-3f31348e7f44", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "c7c281e5-5354-4773-8fc4-45a2d5b1181c", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "81dacfd9-d3ca-40f8-b351-78be8de50e66", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "81dacfd9-d3ca-40f8-b351-78be8de50e66"}, {"title": "Sites Pay for Streaming", "create_time": 1710452112.656183, "update_time": 1710586925.870799, "mapping": {"5d7d80d4-284d-4c84-8298-548028feca02": {"id": "5d7d80d4-284d-4c84-8298-548028feca02", "message": {"id": "5d7d80d4-284d-4c84-8298-548028feca02", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa14d12-7f9d-4868-94ef-c3e1530b02d7", "children": ["aaa22f86-de7a-4ca0-a39c-61b91f9d7991"]}, "aaa14d12-7f9d-4868-94ef-c3e1530b02d7": {"id": "aaa14d12-7f9d-4868-94ef-c3e1530b02d7", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["5d7d80d4-284d-4c84-8298-548028feca02"]}, "aaa22f86-de7a-4ca0-a39c-61b91f9d7991": {"id": "aaa22f86-de7a-4ca0-a39c-61b91f9d7991", "message": {"id": "aaa22f86-de7a-4ca0-a39c-61b91f9d7991", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710452112.657051, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["what sites pay you to stream and allow viewers to tip you?

We work with various payment processors, including PayPal, giving you more ways to monetize your channel than anyone else in the industry. Most importantly, setting up a tip page is entirely free. What\u2019s more, we will never take a cut of the money you receive. Setting up your tip page only takes a few seconds, so let\u2019s dive into it.\n\nIf you are logging into Streamlabs.com for the first time, the onboarding process will ask you to add your Paypal email address or other support payment processor. Once you finish that step, your tip page is ready to go; this is the fastest way to set up your donation page, but if you\u2019ve already logged in or skipped the onboarding, you can also set up your tip page from the settings.\n\nTo do that:\n\n  * 1) Log in to the dashboard on Streamlabs.com. Click on \u2018Settings\u2019 in the lower left-hand corner.\n\n[Image 8: Streamlabs settings menu] \n\n  * 2) Click on Donation Settings &gt; Methods and choose your preferred Payment Processor.\n\n[Image 9: Streamlabs settings page] \n\n  * 3) Go through the necessary steps to connect your account.\n\n[Image 10: Streamlabs connect paypal] \n\n  * 4) After your account is connected, your tip page will be available at streamlabs.com/USERNAME.\n\n[Image 11: Streamlabs tip page] \n\n## Manage Tip Page Settings\n\nYou can manage a range of tip page settings from the Streamlabs dashboard. Not based in the US? Choose which currency you\u2019d like donations to appear in. Set the minimum amount required to donate, and even adjust the recommended amount that appears for a user when they visit your tip page.\n\nEdit the message that appears on your page when users visit, adjust profanity filters to block out offensive words, and even customize the image that appears as your donation page header.\n\nVisit the\u00a0\u301086\u2020dashboard\u3011\u00a0to view all of the tip page settings.\n\n## Adding Tip Page Link\n\nDepending on the platform you choose, the process to add a link to your tip page is going to be different. Both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming only allow you to copy and paste a link to your Tip Page in your page description or about section. Twitch takes it one step further and gives you the option to add customized panels.\n\n### Add a Twitch Tip Panel\n\nIn the upper-right corner, click your profile icon.\n\n[Image 12: Twitch profile icon]\n\nSelect Channel from the drop-down menu.\n\n[Image 13: Twitch channel menu]\n\nClick the About section on the next screen.\n\n[Image 14: Twitch about]\n\nToggle the Edit Panels option in the top left section of the screen.\n\n[Image 15: Twitch edit panels]\n\nScroll down and click the box with a large plus sign in it and then click &quot;Add a Text or Image Panel&quot;.\n\n[Image 16: Twitch Add a Text or Image Panel]\n\nNow you can add a title to your panel, the link to your Streamlabs Tip Page, a Description, and an image.\n\n[Image 17: Twitch Panel title]\n\n### Need an Image?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently rolled out a new feature giving streamers the ability to add professionally designed panels from a selection of over 50 different templates.\n\nVisit our\u00a0\u301087\u2020Panel Maker page on the Streamlabs Dashboard\u3011\u00a0to start designing your own panels today.\n\n[Image 18: Streamlabs Panel maker] \n\n## Subscriptions\n\nUnlike tips or donations, subscriptions provide you with a more reliable source of income. If you want to become a full-time streamer, you\u2019ll need this supplemental revenue to assist you along the way.\n\nIn this section, we will be discussing how you can monetize your live stream through subscriptions. We\u2019ll specifically discuss the benefits and differences between Twitch subscriptions, YouTube Channel Memberships, and Facebook Fan Subscriptions. We will also discuss how to persuade your viewers to invest in your content and what benefits you can provide to convince them to stay subscribed.\n\n[Image 19: Streamlabs Subscriptions] \n\n## Subscriptions at a Glance\n\nTwitch Subscriptions YouTube Channel Membership Facebook Fan Subscription  \n\nCost\n\n$4.99, $9.99, $24.99\n\nStarting at 4.99, with the ability to \u301088\u2020customize price points\u2020support.google.com\u3011\n\n$4.99  \n\nCommission\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\nAs of August 2020 and for the next year, Facebook will not be taking any fees from Fan Subscriptions.  \n\nRequirements\n\nTwitch streamers must be either a Twitch Affiliate or a Twitch Partner.\n\nVisit our \u301089\u2020guide\u3011 for tips to help you become an affiliate\n\n30,000 subscribers; Gaming channels must have at least 1,000\n\nMember of YouTube Partner Program\n\n10,000 followers or 250+ Return Viewers and one of the following in the last 60 days:\n\n- 50,000 Post Engagements\n\n- 180,000 watch minutes  \n\n## Twitch Subscriber Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily. These are as follows:\n\n  * Ad-Free Viewing\u00a0\u2013 As a subscriber, Twitch will not force you to watch ads before you start watching a stream (with limited exceptions).\n  * Sub-Badges\u00a0\u2013 Custom badges are unlocked when you subscribe to a streamer. Badges are displayed next to a viewer&#x27;s name when they participate in the channel&#x27;s chat. Streamers can customize badges, and viewers will generally receive new badges the longer they stay subscribed. You start with the 1-month badge and get new badges for three months, six months, etc.\n  * Emotes\u00a0\u2013 Once a streamer reaches affiliate status, custom emotes become available. It is a fantastic way to reinforce your branding as a streamer because viewers can use them across all Twitch channels. The number of subscribers a streamer has dictates the number of emotes a streamer can have.\n  * Sub-Only Chat/Streams\u00a0\u2013 Occasionally, a streamer will host a sub-only stream. Hosting a stream for your most dedicated viewers is a great way to encourage viewers to sub. During these streams, only subscribers can view the broadcast. Streamers can also set their chat to &quot;subscribers only.&quot;\n\n[Image 20: Twitch Subscriptions at a Glance]\n\n## Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily. These are as follows:\n\n  * Exclusive content:\u00a0Publish posts, videos, and other content exclusively to your most loyal supporters. Exclusive content generally includes:\n  * Supporter-only polls or Q&amp;As:\u00a0give supporters more ways to engage and interact with you.\n  * Behind-the-scenes:\u00a0Give viewers a look at the production and day to day activity of your live stream.\n  * Exclusive live videos:\u00a0Private live videos can provide an opportunity to answer questions and gain feedback from your community.\n  * Discounts:\u00a0Provide discount codes for merch, events, or other products through supporter only messages or posts.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, you can also provide supporters with:\n\n  * Recognition with\u00a0\u301090\u2020shout outs\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\u00a0in public posts.\n  * Early access to your content with supporter-only Premieres or Watch Parties that later go public.\n\n[Image 21: Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits]\n\n## YouTube Channel Membership Benefits\n\nDifferent perks are available based on the various membership levels available. Streamers can offer multiple membership levels, which all have different prices. Remember, perks build on each other. The highest-priced membership levels will have access to the perks offered at lower-priced levels.\n\n  * Members-only Community posts\u00a0- Use the community tab to share content only with members.

We work with various payment processors, including PayPal, giving you more ways to monetize your channel than anyone else in the industry. Most importantly, setting up a tip page is entirely free. What\u2019s more, we will never take a cut of the money you receive. Setting up your tip page only takes a few seconds, so let\u2019s dive into it.\n\nIf you are logging into Streamlabs.com for the first time, the onboarding process will ask you to add your Paypal email address or other support payment processor. Once you finish that step, your tip page is ready to go; this is the fastest way to set up your donation page, but if you\u2019ve already logged in or skipped the onboarding, you can also set up your tip page from the settings.\n\nTo do that:\n\n  * 1) Log in to the dashboard on Streamlabs.com. Click on \u2018Settings\u2019 in the lower left-hand corner.\n\n[Image 8: Streamlabs settings menu] \n\n  * 2) Click on Donation Settings &gt; Methods and choose your preferred Payment Processor.\n\n[Image 9: Streamlabs settings page] \n\n  * 3) Go through the necessary steps to connect your account.\n\n[Image 10: Streamlabs connect paypal] \n\n  * 4) After your account is connected, your tip page will be available at streamlabs.com/USERNAME.\n\n[Image 11: Streamlabs tip page] \n\n## Manage Tip Page Settings\n\nYou can manage a range of tip page settings from the Streamlabs dashboard. Not based in the US? Choose which currency you\u2019d like donations to appear in. Set the minimum amount required to donate, and even adjust the recommended amount that appears for a user when they visit your tip page.\n\nEdit the message that appears on your page when users visit, adjust profanity filters to block out offensive words, and even customize the image that appears as your donation page header.\n\nVisit the\u00a0\u301086\u2020dashboard\u3011\u00a0to view all of the tip page settings.\n\n## Adding Tip Page Link\n\nDepending on the platform you choose, the process to add a link to your tip page is going to be different. Both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming only allow you to copy and paste a link to your Tip Page in your page description or about section. Twitch takes it one step further and gives you the option to add customized panels.\n\n### Add a Twitch Tip Panel\n\nIn the upper-right corner, click your profile icon.\n\n[Image 12: Twitch profile icon]\n\nSelect Channel from the drop-down menu.\n\n[Image 13: Twitch channel menu]\n\nClick the About section on the next screen.\n\n[Image 14: Twitch about]\n\nToggle the Edit Panels option in the top left section of the screen.\n\n[Image 15: Twitch edit panels]\n\nScroll down and click the box with a large plus sign in it and then click &quot;Add a Text or Image Panel&quot;.\n\n[Image 16: Twitch Add a Text or Image Panel]\n\nNow you can add a title to your panel, the link to your Streamlabs Tip Page, a Description, and an image.\n\n[Image 17: Twitch Panel title]\n\n### Need an Image?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently rolled out a new feature giving streamers the ability to add professionally designed panels from a selection of over 50 different templates.\n\nVisit our\u00a0\u301087\u2020Panel Maker page on the Streamlabs Dashboard\u3011\u00a0to start designing your own panels today.\n\n[Image 18: Streamlabs Panel maker] \n\n## Subscriptions\n\nUnlike tips or donations, subscriptions provide you with a more reliable source of income. If you want to become a full-time streamer, you\u2019ll need this supplemental revenue to assist you along the way.\n\nIn this section, we will be discussing how you can monetize your live stream through subscriptions. We\u2019ll specifically discuss the benefits and differences between Twitch subscriptions, YouTube Channel Memberships, and Facebook Fan Subscriptions. We will also discuss how to persuade your viewers to invest in your content and what benefits you can provide to convince them to stay subscribed.\n\n[Image 19: Streamlabs Subscriptions] \n\n## Subscriptions at a Glance\n\nTwitch Subscriptions YouTube Channel Membership Facebook Fan Subscription  \n\nCost\n\n$4.99, $9.99, $24.99\n\nStarting at 4.99, with the ability to \u301088\u2020customize price points\u2020support.google.com\u3011\n\n$4.99  \n\nCommission\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\nAs of August 2020 and for the next year, Facebook will not be taking any fees from Fan Subscriptions.  \n\nRequirements\n\nTwitch streamers must be either a Twitch Affiliate or a Twitch Partner.\n\nVisit our \u301089\u2020guide\u3011 for tips to help you become an affiliate\n\n30,000 subscribers; Gaming channels must have at least 1,000\n\nMember of YouTube Partner Program\n\n10,000 followers or 250+ Return Viewers and one of the following in the last 60 days:\n\n- 50,000 Post Engagements\n\n- 180,000 watch minutes  \n\n## Twitch Subscriber Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily. These are as follows:\n\n  * Ad-Free Viewing\u00a0\u2013 As a subscriber, Twitch will not force you to watch ads before you start watching a stream (with limited exceptions).\n  * Sub-Badges\u00a0\u2013 Custom badges are unlocked when you subscribe to a streamer. Badges are displayed next to a viewer&#x27;s name when they participate in the channel&#x27;s chat. Streamers can customize badges, and viewers will generally receive new badges the longer they stay subscribed. You start with the 1-month badge and get new badges for three months, six months, etc.\n  * Emotes\u00a0\u2013 Once a streamer reaches affiliate status, custom emotes become available. It is a fantastic way to reinforce your branding as a streamer because viewers can use them across all Twitch channels. The number of subscribers a streamer has dictates the number of emotes a streamer can have.\n  * Sub-Only Chat/Streams\u00a0\u2013 Occasionally, a streamer will host a sub-only stream. Hosting a stream for your most dedicated viewers is a great way to encourage viewers to sub. During these streams, only subscribers can view the broadcast. Streamers can also set their chat to &quot;subscribers only.&quot;\n\n[Image 20: Twitch Subscriptions at a Glance]\n\n## Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily. These are as follows:\n\n  * Exclusive content:\u00a0Publish posts, videos, and other content exclusively to your most loyal supporters. Exclusive content generally includes:\n  * Supporter-only polls or Q&amp;As:\u00a0give supporters more ways to engage and interact with you.\n  * Behind-the-scenes:\u00a0Give viewers a look at the production and day to day activity of your live stream.\n  * Exclusive live videos:\u00a0Private live videos can provide an opportunity to answer questions and gain feedback from your community.\n  * Discounts:\u00a0Provide discount codes for merch, events, or other products through supporter only messages or posts.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, you can also provide supporters with:\n\n  * Recognition with\u00a0\u301090\u2020shout outs\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011\u00a0in public posts.\n  * Early access to your content with supporter-only Premieres or Watch Parties that later go public.\n\n[Image 21: Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits]\n\n## YouTube Channel Membership Benefits\n\nDifferent perks are available based on the various membership levels available. Streamers can offer multiple membership levels, which all have different prices. Remember, perks build on each other. The highest-priced membership levels will have access to the perks offered at lower-priced levels.\n\n  * Members-only Community posts\u00a0- Use the community tab to share content only with members. You can also share Community posts with members at specific levels.\n  * Members-only video\u00a0- Set videos that can only be seen by your members.

Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding. If you have a project to complete and you\u2019re looking for funding, set up pages on these websites and use your live streams to promote it.\n\nIf you stream with \u30101\u2020Restream\u3011, you can easily add a Patreon or GoFundMe \u301016\u2020link as a QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 that you can display as an overlay on your stream.\n\nFor most of these services, you should consider creating special rewards and content for the people who support you. Decide carefully which content goes behind the paywall and which stays free, though. You can\u2019t keep all your best stuff locked behind a subscription; some of it has to stay free to attract new viewers.\n\n## 3. Paid subscriptions from viewers \n\nGetting an occasional tip from your viewers is great, but regular payments are better. These payments will usually net you a couple of dollars each, but if you can get enough of them, they add up. You\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements to enable this kind of support, as platforms reserve it for members of their content creator programs.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of recurring payment features on the major platforms:\n\n  * YouTube has a \u301024\u2020channel membership program\u2020creatoracademy.youtube.com\u3011 that allows users to subscribe to its channels with monthly payments. To open your YouTube channel (where you group your videos) to this opportunity, you need to be in the \u301025\u2020YouTube Partner Program\u2020support.google.com\u3011 and meet additional eligibility requirements.\n  * Twitch has a \u301026\u2020paid subscription program\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 that lets you earn from paid subscriptions if you\u2019re an \u301020\u2020Affiliate\u3011 or Partner. Your viewers get one subscription for free through Twitch Prime, or they can pay for them using PayPal, Amazon Pay, or credit cards.\n  * Facebook Gaming \u301027\u2020extended its Fan Subscriptions feature\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 to Level Up gaming content creators. You must achieve a certain number of returning weekly viewers, and the feature is only available in certain regions.\n\nIf the platform allows it, you should make content that\u2019s exclusive to your subscribers. It\u2019s a nice way to show your most loyal viewers that you appreciate their support. Also, remember to give a shoutout to people when they subscribe and a mention on their subscription anniversaries.\n\nYou can also use third-party services like Patreon to set up recurring payments or subscriptions from fans.\n\n## 4. Revenue from ads \n\nAdvertising revenue powers half the internet, including Google services and Facebook. Why not you too? If you join the right streaming platform or social network, you can start earning some decent ad money.\n\nWhen you start broadcasting live videos on a specific platform, like YouTube or Facebook, you may be able to take advantage of their advertising programs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different types of in-stream ads that are usually available:\n\n  * Pre-roll ads: These ads play as soon as a viewer clicks on your stream. They have to view the ad before they can start watching your content.\n  * Mid-roll ads: Mid-roll ads play in the middle of your live stream. Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8. Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9. Coach/teach/offer lessons \n\nShare your knowledge through live seminars, workshops, or classes. If that sounds too academic for your taste, consider becoming someone\u2019s mentor, coach, or teacher.

Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8. Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9. Coach/teach/offer lessons \n\nShare your knowledge through live seminars, workshops, or classes.

It lets your fans set monthly pledges in return for exclusive content and rewards\u30106\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **TikTok LIVE**: Allows live streaming if you have more than 1,000 followers and offers various monetization options, though you need to be 18 or older to access these features.

Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding. If you have a project to complete and you\u2019re looking for funding, set up pages on these websites and use your live streams to promote it.\n\nIf you stream with \u30101\u2020Restream\u3011, you can easily add a Patreon or GoFundMe \u301016\u2020link as a QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 that you can display as an overlay on your stream.\n\nFor most of these services, you should consider creating special rewards and content for the people who support you. Decide carefully which content goes behind the paywall and which stays free, though. You can\u2019t keep all your best stuff locked behind a subscription; some of it has to stay free to attract new viewers.\n\n## 3. Paid subscriptions from viewers \n\nGetting an occasional tip from your viewers is great, but regular payments are better. These payments will usually net you a couple of dollars each, but if you can get enough of them, they add up. You\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements to enable this kind of support, as platforms reserve it for members of their content creator programs.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of recurring payment features on the major platforms:\n\n  * YouTube has a \u301024\u2020channel membership program\u2020creatoracademy.youtube.com\u3011 that allows users to subscribe to its channels with monthly payments. To open your YouTube channel (where you group your videos) to this opportunity, you need to be in the \u301025\u2020YouTube Partner Program\u2020support.google.com\u3011 and meet additional eligibility requirements.\n  * Twitch has a \u301026\u2020paid subscription program\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 that lets you earn from paid subscriptions if you\u2019re an \u301020\u2020Affiliate\u3011 or Partner. Your viewers get one subscription for free through Twitch Prime, or they can pay for them using PayPal, Amazon Pay, or credit cards.\n  * Facebook Gaming \u301027\u2020extended its Fan Subscriptions feature\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 to Level Up gaming content creators. You must achieve a certain number of returning weekly viewers, and the feature is only available in certain regions.\n\nIf the platform allows it, you should make content that\u2019s exclusive to your subscribers. It\u2019s a nice way to show your most loyal viewers that you appreciate their support. Also, remember to give a shoutout to people when they subscribe and a mention on their subscription anniversaries.\n\nYou can also use third-party services like Patreon to set up recurring payments or subscriptions from fans.\n\n## 4. Revenue from ads \n\nAdvertising revenue powers half the internet, including Google services and Facebook. Why not you too? If you join the right streaming platform or social network, you can start earning some decent ad money.\n\nWhen you start broadcasting live videos on a specific platform, like YouTube or Facebook, you may be able to take advantage of their advertising programs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different types of in-stream ads that are usually available:\n\n  * Pre-roll ads: These ads play as soon as a viewer clicks on your stream. They have to view the ad before they can start watching your content.\n  * Mid-roll ads: Mid-roll ads play in the middle of your live stream. Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8. Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9. Coach/teach/offer lessons \n\nShare your knowledge through live seminars, workshops, or classes. If that sounds too academic for your taste, consider becoming someone\u2019s mentor, coach, or teacher.

We work with various payment processors, including PayPal, giving you more ways to monetize your channel than anyone else in the industry. Most importantly, setting up a tip page is entirely free. What\u2019s more, we will never take a cut of the money you receive. Setting up your tip page only takes a few seconds, so let\u2019s dive into it.\n\nIf you are logging into Streamlabs.com for the first time, the onboarding process will ask you to add your Paypal email address or other support payment processor. Once you finish that step, your tip page is ready to go; this is the fastest way to set up your donation page, but if you\u2019ve already logged in or skipped the onboarding, you can also set up your tip page from the settings.\n\nTo do that:\n\n  * 1) Log in to the dashboard on Streamlabs.com.

Set the minimum amount required to donate, and even adjust the recommended amount that appears for a user when they visit your tip page.\n\nEdit the message that appears on your page when users visit, adjust profanity filters to block out offensive words, and even customize the image that appears as your donation page header.\n\nVisit the\u00a0\u301086\u2020dashboard\u3011\u00a0to view all of the tip page settings.\n\n## Adding Tip Page Link\n\nDepending on the platform you choose, the process to add a link to your tip page is going to be different. Both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming only allow you to copy and paste a link to your Tip Page in your page description or about section. Twitch takes it one step further and gives you the option to add customized panels.\n\n### Add a Twitch Tip Panel\n\nIn the upper-right corner, click your profile icon.\n\n[Image 12: Twitch profile icon]\n\nSelect Channel from the drop-down menu.\n\n[Image 13: Twitch channel menu]\n\nClick the About section on the next screen.\n\n[Image 14: Twitch about]\n\nToggle the Edit Panels option in the top left section of the screen.\n\n[Image 15: Twitch edit panels]\n\nScroll down and click the box with a large plus sign in it and then click &quot;Add a Text or Image Panel&quot;.\n\n[Image 16: Twitch Add a Text or Image Panel]\n\nNow you can add a title to your panel, the link to your Streamlabs Tip Page, a Description, and an image.\n\n[Image 17: Twitch Panel title]\n\n### Need an Image?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently rolled out a new feature giving streamers the ability to add professionally designed panels from a selection of over 50 different templates.\n\nVisit our\u00a0\u301087\u2020Panel Maker page on the Streamlabs Dashboard\u3011\u00a0to start designing your own panels today.\n\n[Image 18: Streamlabs Panel maker] \n\n## Subscriptions\n\nUnlike tips or donations, subscriptions provide you with a more reliable source of income. If you want to become a full-time streamer, you\u2019ll need this supplemental revenue to assist you along the way.\n\nIn this section, we will be discussing how you can monetize your live stream through subscriptions. We\u2019ll specifically discuss the benefits and differences between Twitch subscriptions, YouTube Channel Memberships, and Facebook Fan Subscriptions. We will also discuss how to persuade your viewers to invest in your content and what benefits you can provide to convince them to stay subscribed.\n\n[Image 19: Streamlabs Subscriptions] \n\n## Subscriptions at a Glance\n\nTwitch Subscriptions YouTube Channel Membership Facebook Fan Subscription  \n\nCost\n\n$4.99, $9.99, $24.99\n\nStarting at 4.99, with the ability to \u301088\u2020customize price points\u2020support.google.com\u3011\n\n$4.99  \n\nCommission\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\nAs of August 2020 and for the next year, Facebook will not be taking any fees from Fan Subscriptions.  \n\nRequirements\n\nTwitch streamers must be either a Twitch Affiliate or a Twitch Partner.\n\nVisit our \u301089\u2020guide\u3011 for tips to help you become an affiliate\n\n30,000 subscribers; Gaming channels must have at least 1,000\n\nMember of YouTube Partner Program\n\n10,000 followers or 250+ Return Viewers and one of the following in the last 60 days:\n\n- 50,000 Post Engagements\n\n- 180,000 watch minutes  \n\n## Twitch Subscriber Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily. These are as follows:\n\n  * Ad-Free Viewing\u00a0\u2013 As a subscriber, Twitch will not force you to watch ads before you start watching a stream (with limited exceptions).\n  * Sub-Badges\u00a0\u2013 Custom badges are unlocked when you subscribe to a streamer. Badges are displayed next to a viewer&#x27;s name when they participate in the channel&#x27;s chat. Streamers can customize badges, and viewers will generally receive new badges the longer they stay subscribed. You start with the 1-month badge and get new badges for three months, six months, etc.\n  * Emotes\u00a0\u2013 Once a streamer reaches affiliate status, custom emotes become available. It is a fantastic way to reinforce your branding as a streamer because viewers can use them across all Twitch channels. The number of subscribers a streamer has dictates the number of emotes a streamer can have.\n  * Sub-Only Chat/Streams\u00a0\u2013 Occasionally, a streamer will host a sub-only stream. Hosting a stream for your most dedicated viewers is a great way to encourage viewers to sub. During these streams, only subscribers can view the broadcast. Streamers can also set their chat to &quot;subscribers only.&quot;\n\n[Image 20: Twitch Subscriptions at a Glance]\n\n## Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily.

Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8. Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9. Coach/teach/offer lessons \n\nShare your knowledge through live seminars, workshops, or classes. If that sounds too academic for your taste, consider becoming someone\u2019s mentor, coach, or teacher.

Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding. If you have a project to complete and you\u2019re looking for funding, set up pages on these websites and use your live streams to promote it.\n\nIf you stream with \u30101\u2020Restream\u3011, you can easily add a Patreon or GoFundMe \u301016\u2020link as a QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 that you can display as an overlay on your stream.\n\nFor most of these services, you should consider creating special rewards and content for the people who support you. Decide carefully which content goes behind the paywall and which stays free, though. You can\u2019t keep all your best stuff locked behind a subscription; some of it has to stay free to attract new viewers.\n\n## 3. Paid subscriptions from viewers \n\nGetting an occasional tip from your viewers is great, but regular payments are better. These payments will usually net you a couple of dollars each, but if you can get enough of them, they add up. You\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements to enable this kind of support, as platforms reserve it for members of their content creator programs.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of recurring payment features on the major platforms:\n\n  * YouTube has a \u301024\u2020channel membership program\u2020creatoracademy.youtube.com\u3011 that allows users to subscribe to its channels with monthly payments. To open your YouTube channel (where you group your videos) to this opportunity, you need to be in the \u301025\u2020YouTube Partner Program\u2020support.google.com\u3011 and meet additional eligibility requirements.\n  * Twitch has a \u301026\u2020paid subscription program\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 that lets you earn from paid subscriptions if you\u2019re an \u301020\u2020Affiliate\u3011 or Partner. Your viewers get one subscription for free through Twitch Prime, or they can pay for them using PayPal, Amazon Pay, or credit cards.\n  * Facebook Gaming \u301027\u2020extended its Fan Subscriptions feature\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 to Level Up gaming content creators. You must achieve a certain number of returning weekly viewers, and the feature is only available in certain regions.\n\nIf the platform allows it, you should make content that\u2019s exclusive to your subscribers. It\u2019s a nice way to show your most loyal viewers that you appreciate their support. Also, remember to give a shoutout to people when they subscribe and a mention on their subscription anniversaries.\n\nYou can also use third-party services like Patreon to set up recurring payments or subscriptions from fans.\n\n## 4. Revenue from ads \n\nAdvertising revenue powers half the internet, including Google services and Facebook. Why not you too? If you join the right streaming platform or social network, you can start earning some decent ad money.\n\nWhen you start broadcasting live videos on a specific platform, like YouTube or Facebook, you may be able to take advantage of their advertising programs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different types of in-stream ads that are usually available:\n\n  * Pre-roll ads: These ads play as soon as a viewer clicks on your stream. They have to view the ad before they can start watching your content.\n  * Mid-roll ads: Mid-roll ads play in the middle of your live stream. Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store.

Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9.

We work with various payment processors, including PayPal, giving you more ways to monetize your channel than anyone else in the industry. Most importantly, setting up a tip page is entirely free. What\u2019s more, we will never take a cut of the money you receive. Setting up your tip page only takes a few seconds, so let\u2019s dive into it.\n\nIf you are logging into Streamlabs.com for the first time, the onboarding process will ask you to add your Paypal email address or other support payment processor. Once you finish that step, your tip page is ready to go; this is the fastest way to set up your donation page, but if you\u2019ve already logged in or skipped the onboarding, you can also set up your tip page from the settings.\n\nTo do that:\n\n  * 1) Log in to the dashboard on Streamlabs.com. Click on \u2018Settings\u2019 in the lower left-hand corner.\n\n[Image 8: Streamlabs settings menu] \n\n  * 2) Click on Donation Settings &gt; Methods and choose your preferred Payment Processor.\n\n[Image 9: Streamlabs settings page] \n\n  * 3) Go through the necessary steps to connect your account.\n\n[Image 10: Streamlabs connect paypal] \n\n  * 4) After your account is connected, your tip page will be available at streamlabs.com/USERNAME.\n\n[Image 11: Streamlabs tip page] \n\n## Manage Tip Page Settings\n\nYou can manage a range of tip page settings from the Streamlabs dashboard. Not based in the US? Choose which currency you\u2019d like donations to appear in. Set the minimum amount required to donate, and even adjust the recommended amount that appears for a user when they visit your tip page.\n\nEdit the message that appears on your page when users visit, adjust profanity filters to block out offensive words, and even customize the image that appears as your donation page header.\n\nVisit the\u00a0\u301086\u2020dashboard\u3011\u00a0to view all of the tip page settings.\n\n## Adding Tip Page Link\n\nDepending on the platform you choose, the process to add a link to your tip page is going to be different. Both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming only allow you to copy and paste a link to your Tip Page in your page description or about section. Twitch takes it one step further and gives you the option to add customized panels.\n\n### Add a Twitch Tip Panel\n\nIn the upper-right corner, click your profile icon.\n\n[Image 12: Twitch profile icon]\n\nSelect Channel from the drop-down menu.\n\n[Image 13: Twitch channel menu]\n\nClick the About section on the next screen.\n\n[Image 14: Twitch about]\n\nToggle the Edit Panels option in the top left section of the screen.\n\n[Image 15: Twitch edit panels]\n\nScroll down and click the box with a large plus sign in it and then click &quot;Add a Text or Image Panel&quot;.\n\n[Image 16: Twitch Add a Text or Image Panel]\n\nNow you can add a title to your panel, the link to your Streamlabs Tip Page, a Description, and an image.\n\n[Image 17: Twitch Panel title]\n\n### Need an Image?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently rolled out a new feature giving streamers the ability to add professionally designed panels from a selection of over 50 different templates.\n\nVisit our\u00a0\u301087\u2020Panel Maker page on the Streamlabs Dashboard\u3011\u00a0to start designing your own panels today.\n\n[Image 18: Streamlabs Panel maker] \n\n## Subscriptions\n\nUnlike tips or donations, subscriptions provide you with a more reliable source of income. If you want to become a full-time streamer, you\u2019ll need this supplemental revenue to assist you along the way.\n\nIn this section, we will be discussing how you can monetize your live stream through subscriptions. We\u2019ll specifically discuss the benefits and differences between Twitch subscriptions, YouTube Channel Memberships, and Facebook Fan Subscriptions. We will also discuss how to persuade your viewers to invest in your content and what benefits you can provide to convince them to stay subscribed.\n\n[Image 19: Streamlabs Subscriptions] \n\n## Subscriptions at a Glance\n\nTwitch Subscriptions YouTube Channel Membership Facebook Fan Subscription  \n\nCost\n\n$4.99, $9.99, $24.99\n\nStarting at 4.99, with the ability to \u301088\u2020customize price points\u2020support.google.com\u3011\n\n$4.99  \n\nCommission\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\nAs of August 2020 and for the next year, Facebook will not be taking any fees from Fan Subscriptions.  \n\nRequirements\n\nTwitch streamers must be either a Twitch Affiliate or a Twitch Partner.\n\nVisit our \u301089\u2020guide\u3011 for tips to help you become an affiliate\n\n30,000 subscribers; Gaming channels must have at least 1,000\n\nMember of YouTube Partner Program\n\n10,000 followers or 250+ Return Viewers and one of the following in the last 60 days:\n\n- 50,000 Post Engagements\n\n- 180,000 watch minutes  \n\n## Twitch Subscriber Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily. These are as follows:\n\n  * Ad-Free Viewing\u00a0\u2013 As a subscriber, Twitch will not force you to watch ads before you start watching a stream (with limited exceptions).\n  * Sub-Badges\u00a0\u2013 Custom badges are unlocked when you subscribe to a streamer. Badges are displayed next to a viewer&#x27;s name when they participate in the channel&#x27;s chat. Streamers can customize badges, and viewers will generally receive new badges the longer they stay subscribed. You start with the 1-month badge and get new badges for three months, six months, etc.\n  * Emotes\u00a0\u2013 Once a streamer reaches affiliate status, custom emotes become available. It is a fantastic way to reinforce your branding as a streamer because viewers can use them across all Twitch channels. The number of subscribers a streamer has dictates the number of emotes a streamer can have.\n  * Sub-Only Chat/Streams\u00a0\u2013 Occasionally, a streamer will host a sub-only stream. Hosting a stream for your most dedicated viewers is a great way to encourage viewers to sub. During these streams, only subscribers can view the broadcast. Streamers can also set their chat to &quot;subscribers only.&quot;\n\n[Image 20: Twitch Subscriptions at a Glance]\n\n## Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily.

Streamers can offer multiple membership levels, which all have different prices. Remember, perks build on each other. The highest-priced membership levels will have access to the perks offered at lower-priced levels.\n\n  * Members-only Community posts\u00a0- Use the community tab to share content only with members. You can also share Community posts with members at specific levels.\n  * Members-only video\u00a0- Set videos that can only be seen by your members. Anyone can find a members-only video, but only members at the right level(s) can watch it.\n  * Members-only live streams\u00a0- Share a live stream exclusively with your members.

These will vary from channel to channel, but some of the most common perks include:\n\n  * Exclusive Chatroom on Discord\u00a0\u2013 Many streamers create exclusive discord servers for their subscribers and members.\n  * Play with Viewers\u00a0\u2013 some streamers set aside days where they play games with their subscribers.\n  * Competitions/Giveaways\u00a0\u2013 Streamers can create special contests or giveaways for their subscribers. These are their way of giving back to their supportive community.\n  * Custom Subscriber Alerts\u00a0\u2013 Create unique alerts that only play when someone subscribes to your channel. Streamlabs makes setting up alerts easy, so be sure to\u00a0\u301091\u2020read our guide\u3011\u00a0to learn how to start creating unique alerts.\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFor most content creators, tips "}, {"matched_text": "\u30106\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 756, "end_idx": 766, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "9 Ways You Can Make Money With Live Streaming \u2013 Restream Blog", "url": "https://restream.io/blog/ways-you-can-make-money-live-streaming/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nIf you don\u2019t want to use the tipping system within the streaming platform \u2014 or you don\u2019t meet the requirements to use it \u2014 you can use a third-party platform. Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding. If you have a project to complete and you\u2019re looking for funding, set up pages on these websites and use your live streams to promote it.\n\nIf you stream with \u30101\u2020Restream\u3011, you can easily add a Patreon or GoFundMe \u301016\u2020link as a QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 that you can display as an overlay on your stream.\n\nFor most of these services, you should consider creating special rewards and content for the people who support you. Decide carefully which content goes behind the paywall and which stays free, though. You can\u2019t keep all your best stuff locked behind a subscription; some of it has to stay free to attract new viewers.\n\n## 3. Paid subscriptions from viewers \n\nGetting an occasional tip from your viewers is great, but regular payments are better. These payments will usually net you a couple of dollars each, but if you can get enough of them, they add up. You\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements to enable this kind of support, as platforms reserve it for members of their content creator programs.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of recurring payment features on the major platforms:\n\n  * YouTube has a \u301024\u2020channel membership program\u2020creatoracademy.youtube.com\u3011 that allows users to subscribe to its channels with monthly payments. To open your YouTube channel (where you group your videos) to this opportunity, you need to be in the \u301025\u2020YouTube Partner Program\u2020support.google.com\u3011 and meet additional eligibility requirements.\n  * Twitch has a \u301026\u2020paid subscription program\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 that lets you earn from paid subscriptions if you\u2019re an \u301020\u2020Affiliate\u3011 or Partner. Your viewers get one subscription for free through Twitch Prime, or they can pay for them using PayPal, Amazon Pay, or credit cards.\n  * Facebook Gaming \u301027\u2020extended its Fan Subscriptions feature\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 to Level Up gaming content creators. You must achieve a certain number of returning weekly viewers, and the feature is only available in certain regions.\n\nIf the platform allows it, you should make content that\u2019s exclusive to your subscribers. It\u2019s a nice way to show your most loyal viewers that you appreciate their support. Also, remember to give a shoutout to people when they subscribe and a mention on their subscription anniversaries.\n\nYou can also use third-party services like Patreon to set up recurring payments or subscriptions from fans.\n\n## 4. Revenue from ads \n\nAdvertising revenue powers half the internet, including Google services and Facebook. Why not you too? If you join the right streaming platform or social network, you can start earning some decent ad money.\n\nWhen you start broadcasting live videos on a specific platform, like YouTube or Facebook, you may be able to take advantage of their advertising programs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different types of in-stream ads that are usually available:\n\n  * Pre-roll ads: These ads play as soon as a viewer clicks on your stream. They have to view the ad before they can start watching your content.\n  * Mid-roll ads: Mid-roll ads play in the middle of your live stream. Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8.

Pleasure is a key aspect of life, and human beings seek out what gives them pleasure. We are naturally attracted to what makes us feel good. \n\n\nTake my favorite food, cheese, for instance. Scientific studies have revealed that cheese contains a chemical called casein, known for its ability to induce feelings of pleasure. This chemical is so powerful that it triggers the same brain regions as opioids, potentially leading to addictive behaviors. Yet, my intention is not addiction, but rather, to experience the joy that comes from feeling good. Hence, my love for cheese. \n\nBut it&#x27;s not just about the cheese. I often find myself pondering\u2014what truly brings us that feeling of goodness?  What are the essential elements that guarantee a delightful human experience? Is it all about chemical receptors in the brain? Is happiness just a pill or does it encompass something deeper? Is the true science of feeling good science or just a philosophy or attitude that keeps the human mood in optimal condition? Let\u2019s explore what we know about the science of feeling good and its intersections with behavioral philosophy and psychology to get the bottom of the mystery humans have pondered and sought for millennia: How to feel good all the time and lead a happy and meaningful life. \n______\n\n\nFinish writing the blog post/article above supplementing it with scientific, psychology, and philosophic journal articles, academic papers and studies, that answer the central question and support the main idea posed in the introduction above "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "request_id": "864c8227a806526a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "534d892a-890c-47ce-bcde-30499212dd37", "children": ["1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42"]}, "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42": {"id": "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42", "message": {"id": "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710505762.138889, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "json", "response_format_name": null, "text": "{&quot;query&quot;:&quot;science of feeling good behavioral psychology philosophy&quot;}"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100265]}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "parent_id": "aaa23db8-6bfe-4207-9784-b18836b77563", "request_id": "864c8227a806526a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa23db8-6bfe-4207-9784-b18836b77563", "children": ["8b070ecb-cbe6-4a41-83ce-2fcef0265bcc"]}, "8b070ecb-cbe6-4a41-83ce-2fcef0265bcc": {"id": "8b070ecb-cbe6-4a41-83ce-2fcef0265bcc", "message": {"id": "8b070ecb-cbe6-4a41-83ce-2fcef0265bcc", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710505762.141612, "update_time": 1710505762.1182866, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"jit_plugin_data": {"from_server": {"type": "confirm_action", "body": {"domain": "chat.consensus.app", "is_consequential": false, "privacy_policy": "https://consensus.app/home/privacy-policy/", "method": "get", "path": "/quick_search", "operation": "search_papers", "params": {"query": "science of feeling good behavioral psychology philosophy"}, "actions": [{"name": "allow", "type": "allow", "allow": {"target_message_id": "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42"}}, {"type": "always_allow", "always_allow": {"target_message_id": "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42", "operation_hash": "ef26f5766b50deb71a60a99083acf4c086e7a67f"}}, {"name": "decline", "type": "deny", "deny": {"target_message_id": "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42"}}]}}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42", "request_id": "864c8227a806526a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "assistant", "channel": null}, "parent": "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42", "children": ["3284e8b9-3ccc-4d94-8070-582c0ebba32b"]}, "3284e8b9-3ccc-4d94-8070-582c0ebba32b": {"id": "3284e8b9-3ccc-4d94-8070-582c0ebba32b", "message": {"id": "3284e8b9-3ccc-4d94-8070-582c0ebba32b", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710505766.960006, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"jit_plugin_data": {"from_client": {"type": "allow", "target_message_id": "1b7cb532-45c5-4590-bce0-f1bdb6962e42"}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "request_id": "864c82522d7b526a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8b070ecb-cbe6-4a41-83ce-2fcef0265bcc", "children": ["b7e1745a-858c-479a-9189-2d6c91168781"]}, "b7e1745a-858c-479a-9189-2d6c91168781": {"id": "b7e1745a-858c-479a-9189-2d6c91168781", "message": {"id": "b7e1745a-858c-479a-9189-2d6c91168781", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710505826.290481, "update_time": 1710505790.5788245, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{&quot;items&quot;:[{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Effect of feeling good on helping: cookies and kindness.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Two experiments with adult subjects investigated the effects of a person&#x27;s positive affective state on his or her subsequent helpfulness to others. \\&quot;Feeling good\\&quot;

An introduction.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;A science of positive subjective experience, positive individual traits, and positive institutions promises to improve quality of life and prevent the pathologies that arise when life is barren and meaningless. The exclusive focus on pathology that has dominated so much of our discipline results in a model of the human being lacking the positive features that make life worth living. Hope, wisdom, creativity, future mindedness, courage, spirituality, responsibility, and perseverance are ignored or explained as transformations of more authentic negative impulses. The 15 articles in this millennial issue of the American Psychologist discuss such issues as what enables happiness, the effects of autonomy and self-regulation, how optimism and hope affect health, what constitutes wisdom, and how talent and creativity come to fruition. The authors outline a framework for a science of positive psychology, point to gaps in our knowledge, and predict that the next century will see a science and profession that will come to understand and build the factors that allow individuals, communities, and societies to flourish.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

A field concerned with well-being and optimal functioning, positive psychology aims to broaden the focus of clinical psychology beyond suffering and its direct alleviation. Our proposed conceptual framework parses happiness into three domains: pleasure, engagement, and meaning. For each of these constructs, there are now valid and practical assessment tools appropriate for the clinical setting. Additionally, mounting evidence demonstrates the efficacy and effectiveness of positive interventions aimed at cultivating pleasure, engagement, and meaning. We contend that positive interventions are justifiable in their own right. Positive interventions may also usefully supplement direct attempts to prevent and treat psychopathology and, indeed, may covertly be a central component of good psychotherapy as it is done now.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Japanese and American college students (total N = 913) reported how frequently they experienced various emotional states in daily life. In support of the hypothesis, the reported frequency of general positive emotions (e.g. calm, elated) was most closely associated with the reported frequency of interpersonally engaged positive emotions (e.g. friendly feelings) in Japan, but with the reported frequency of interpersonally disengaged positive emotions (e.g. pride) in the United States. Further, for Americans the reported frequency of experience was considerably higher for positive emotions than for negative emotions, but for Japanese it was higher for engaged emotions than for disengaged emotions.

Similarly, the study of work stress, burnout, conflict, dysfunctional attitudes, counterproductive behaviors and other negative constructs that have preoccupied organizational behavior and human resources management scholars and practitioners have also not necessarily shed additional light on the characteristics of exceptional performers or the dynamic processes that facilitate excellence in the workplace. This realization motivated positive psychologists and positive organizational behavior (POB) scholars to launch new and exciting streams of research that focus on positivity in its own right, rather than simply extrapolating existing mainstream research. This essay focuses on one of these streams of research, namely psychological capital or simply PsyCap. We use this stream of research as an example and illustration of positive research in terms of rigor and relevance. We present conceptual frameworks in which positivity, particularly PsyCap, can promote well-being, both at and beyond the workplace.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Carolyn M.

Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations. In general, social psychologists have a preference for laboratory-based, empirical findings. Social psychology theories tend to be specific and focused, rather than global and general. Social psychology is an interdisciplinary domain that bridges the gap between psychology and sociology. During the years immediately following World War II, there was frequent collaboration between psychologists and sociologists.[2] However, the two disciplines have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists focusing on \\&quot;macro variables\\&quot; (e.g., social structure) to a much greater extent. Nevertheless, sociological approaches to social psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area. In addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and European social psychologists. As a broad generalization, American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena (see group dynamics).[3]&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist&#x27;s total scheme of investigation.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

This is known as the heterogeneity problem. To get around this problem, the motivational theory of pleasure suggests that what makes an experience one of pleasure is our reaction to it, not something internal to the experience. I argue that the motivational theory is wrong, and not only wrong, but backwards. The heterogeneity problem is the principal source of motivation for this, otherwise, highly counterintuitive theory. I intend to show that the heterogeneity problem is not a genuine problem and that a more straightforward theory of pleasure is forthcoming.

We propose that feeling and expressing positive emotions on the job have favorable consequences on: 1 employees independent of their relationships with others e.g., greater persistence, 2 reactions of others to employees e.g., \\&quot;halo,\\&quot; or overgeneralization to other desirable traits, and 3 reactions of employees to others e.g., helping others. These three sets of intervening processes are proposed, in turn, to lead to work achievement, job enrichment and a higher quality social context. A partial test of this framework is made in an 18-month study of 272 employees. Results indicate that positive emotion on the job at time 1 is associated with evidence of work achievement more favorable supervisor evaluations and higher pay and a supportive social context more support from supervisors and coworkers at time 2. But positive emotion at time 1 is not significantly associated with job enrichment at time 2.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Barry M. Staw&quot;,&quot;R. I. Sutton&quot;,&quot;L. H.

In the first part he deals with pleasure and pain and the general nature of emotion. He advocates a theory of emotion which he terms \u201cphysiological.\u201d Feeling is regarded as a primary aspect of mental life, closely connected with biological conditions; and the author seems to think that it is hopeless in this region of psychology, at any rate, to depend wholly on purely psychological methods, the subject only becoming intelligible by going beyond consciousness and treating it in its physiological relations. As part of this general theory Prof. Ribot adopts, with some qualification, the theory illustrated by James in the words, \u201cwe feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble.\u201d In the second part, dealing with the special forms of emotion, no attempt is made to give an elaborate classification; but the chief aspects of emotional life are described in the order in which they seem to have developed. In this part, and especially in the chapters on character and temperament, the author brings out the great value of pathology in the study of psychology.The Psychology of the Emotions.By Th. Ribot.

The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;In this article, the author describes a new theoretical perspective on positive emotions and situates this new perspective within the emerging field of positive psychology. The broaden-and-build theory posits that experiences of positive emotions broaden people&#x27;s momentary thought-action repertoires, which in turn serves to build their enduring personal resources, ranging from physical and intellectual resources to social and psychological resources. Preliminary empirical evidence supporting the broaden-and-build theory is reviewed, and open empirical questions that remain to be tested are identified. The theory and findings suggest that the capacity to experience positive emotions may be a fundamental human strength central to the study of human flourishing.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;B.

In their place, they postulate nonmotivational \\&quot;cold\\&quot; cognitions. Behavioral variations between individuals are thus reduced to differences in information processing abilities, while biases and other apparently motivated behaviors are explained on the \\&quot;faulty computer\\&quot; model. However, as many cognitive psychologists now acknowledge this mechanistic theory fails to tie the processing of information to the performance of actions. In a creative attempt to bridge this gap, the editors and investigators have begun to challenge the prevailing hot/cold, either/or dichotomy. Instead, they propose the \\&quot;warm look\\&quot; - a synergistic approach to the roles of \\&quot;hot\\&quot; motivations and \\&quot;cold\\&quot; cognitions in the production of behavior. In their view, neither one alone is sufficient to explain social phenomena. In fact, outside of theory, the two are inseparable. This comprehensive handbook attempts an integration of contrasting approaches to behavior discusses the dual contributions of cognition and motivation to affective states, the development and evaluation of the self, and the setting and attainment of goals. Central themes include the notion of different public and private selves forming distinct influences on motivational behavior; the key role of affect in mediating social information processing; and the differences between informational and affective value, or between behavior geared to finding out versus behavior prompted by a desire to feel good. While much remains to be learned about the complex interplay of motivation and cognition, these studies demonstrate that the two can no longer be treated as separate, unrelated factors. Subjective states and goals clearly influence information processing, while the acquisition of information alters affect and behavior. An ambitious and original attempt to bridge the gap between thought and action, the Handbook is an indispensable reference for all social cognitive and developmental psychologists, investigators of personality and motivation, and advanced students in these areas.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

In contrast, behavioral ecologists assume them to indicate behavioral intentions or action requests. To test these contrasting positions, over 2,000 online participants were presented with facial expressions and asked what they revealed-feeling states, behavioral intentions, or action requests. The majority of the observers chose feeling states as the message of facial expressions of disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, and surprise, supporting the emotions view. Only the anger display tended to elicit more choices of behavioral intention or action request, partially supporting the behavioral ecology view. The results support the view that facial expressions communicate emotions, with emotions being multicomponential phenomena that comprise feelings, intentions, and wishes.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

This point of view, however, has come under increasing criticism among positive psychologists, and in this chapter we complement these recent perspectives. By applying principles of motivation science, we construct an alternative theory of the good life that emphasizes the importance of people having an effective organization of their value, truth, and control motives (Higgins, 2012). This working together among value, truth, and control motives creates the sense of an overall \u201cfit\u201d with one&#x27;s world that creates an experience of \u201cfeeling right\u201d about one&#x27;s life. Drawing on ancient wisdom and modern science, we argue that this perspective offers us a fuller picture of \u201cthe good life.\u201d&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;E.

Scientific literature provides insights into what constitutes happiness, well-being, and a fulfilling life. Here&#x27;s how these studies contribute to our understanding:\n\n1. **Positive affective state enhances helpfulness**: Individuals in a positive mood, such as those experiencing the joy of consuming a favorite food like cheese, are more likely to be helpful and kind to others. This suggests that feeling good not only benefits the individual but also impacts their social behavior positively [(Isen &amp; Levin, 1972)](https://consensus.app/papers/feeling-helping-cookies-kindness-isen/918add22d7765176be5e98c096c4966e/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n2. **Subjective well-being and happiness**: Subjective well-being, or people&#x27;s cognitive and affective evaluations of their lives, plays a crucial role in what makes us feel good. Understanding the components of subjective well-being, such as adaptation, goals, and temperament, can contribute to our overall happiness [(Diener, 2000)](https://consensus.app/papers/wellbeing-science-happiness-proposal-index-diener/93acebd3c0125f5aa30a28fc32ca0b70/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n3. **Broadening the focus of psychology**: Positive psychology emphasizes positive subjective experiences, individual traits, and positive institutions, broadening the focus beyond the alleviation of suffering. Key elements like hope, creativity, and wisdom are central to feeling good and living a meaningful life [(Seligman &amp; Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi, 2000)](https://consensus.app/papers/psychology-introduction-seligman/5b14058c35ea539a907f69c933e10ffa/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n4. **Cultural influences on well-being**: Cultural differences shape what makes us feel good, indicating that well-being is not only a personal experience but also a cultural construct. For instance, in Japan, positive emotions are more closely associated with interdependence, whereas in the United States, they are linked with independence [(Kitayama, Markus, &amp; Kurokawa, 2000)](https://consensus.app/papers/culture-emotion-wellbeing-good-feelings-japan-united-kitayama/ac4ee7b7b0d3523ea7feb32c1ec8967a/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n5. **Role of positive emotions in well-being**: Positive emotions play a central role in enhancing our well-being. Experiencing positive emotions broadens our thought-action repertoires, which in turn builds our enduring personal resources, contributing to a fulfilling and happy life [(Fredrickson, 2001)](https://consensus.app/papers/role-emotions-psychology-broadenandbuild-theory-fredrickson/f7343b806c1759bbb584074d5e4d45ac/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nIn conclusion, the science of feeling good extends beyond mere chemical reactions in the brain to include psychological, cultural, and philosophical dimensions.

Social support is crucial for emotional health.\n\n2. **Engagement and Flow**: Being deeply engaged in activities that challenge and absorb us, such as hobbies, work, or learning, can lead to a state of &#x27;flow&#x27;, where time seems to stop, and one experiences deep enjoyment and fulfillment.\n\n3. **Meaning and Purpose**: Having a sense of purpose or meaning in life, whether through work, volunteering, or personal beliefs, contributes significantly to overall happiness.\n\n4. **Achievements**: Working towards and reaching goals, even small ones, can provide a sense of accomplishment and contribute to the feeling of goodness.\n\n5. **Gratitude and Positive Thinking**: Cultivating an attitude of gratitude and focusing on positive aspects of life can enhance feelings of well-being.\n\n6. **Physical Health**: Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and healthy eating habits can improve mood and reduce stress, contributing to a feeling of goodness.\n\nAlthough the specific database search did not work this time, these areas are well-represented in psychological and sociological research as key components contributing to the feeling of goodness in the human experience.

Nevertheless, I can provide a general overview based on established psychological theories and research findings.\n\n### Positive States vs. Immediate Stimuli\n\n**Positive States**:\nPositive states such as happiness, contentment, or joy are generally more enduring emotional conditions. They can be influenced by a variety of factors, including one&#x27;s general outlook on life, long-term relationships, career satisfaction, and a sense of purpose or achievement. These states are typically not the direct result of a single stimulus but are built over time through experiences, thoughts, and behaviors that align with one&#x27;s values and goals.\n\n**Immediate Stimuli**:\nImmediate stimuli that produce &#x27;feel good&#x27; feelings are typically specific, short-term triggers that lead to a quick, often visceral reaction. Examples include tasting your favorite food, receiving a compliment, listening to a favorite piece of music, or experiencing a warm, sunny day. These stimuli can directly impact the brain&#x27;s reward system, releasing neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which contribute to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction.\n\n### Mechanism by Which Stimuli Produce Positive Feelings\n\n1. **Sensory Pleasure**: This is the simplest form of pleasure, which comes directly from the senses (e.g., taste, touch, sound, sight, and smell). For example, eating a piece of chocolate can immediately stimulate the brain&#x27;s reward centers, releasing dopamine.\n\n2. **Social Interaction**: Positive social interactions can stimulate the release of oxytocin, often referred to as the &#x27;cuddle hormone&#x27;, which increases feelings of trust, bonding, and social connection.\n\n3. **Novelty**: New experiences or unexpected surprises can trigger the release of dopamine, leading to feelings of pleasure and curiosity.\n\n4. **Accomplishment**: Completing a task or achieving a goal can lead to a sense of satisfaction and elation. This is often associated with the release of endorphins and dopamine, contributing to what is sometimes called the &#x27;achievement high&#x27;.\n\n5. **Aesthetic Appreciation**: Encountering beauty, whether in nature, art, or music, can evoke a profound sense of awe and pleasure, often associated with increased activity in the brain&#x27;s frontal lobes, which are involved in emotional regulation and meaning-making.\n\n6. **Altruism**: Engaging in acts of kindness or helping others can produce a &#x27;helper&#x27;s high&#x27;, associated with endorphin release, which leads to feelings of happiness and well-being.\n\nEach of these mechanisms involves complex interactions within the brain and body, influenced by individual perceptions, past experiences, and personal values.

Positive emotions are conscious processes that involve a variety of components, such as a pleasant experience, facial/body expressions, evaluations, and especially behavioural plans and activation states. People&#x27;s cognitive process is often accompanied by emotions, and the influence of positive emotions on cognitive activities has gradually become the focus of research in recent years. This study constructs a regulation model and an assessment model of positive emotions, and analyses the neural mechanisms of the effects of dopamine substances on human positive emotions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jie Yin&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2019,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Translational Neuroscience&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/study-progress-neural-mechanism-positive-emotions-yin/81d62d707adc575a836980f192b06f33/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1515/tnsci-2019-0016&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;10&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;93 - 98&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:2},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;The neurobiology of positive emotions&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Compared to the study of negative emotions such as fear, the neurobiology of positive emotional processes and the associated positive affect (PA) states has only recently received scientific attention. Biological theories conceptualize PA as being related to (i) signals indicating that bodies are returning to equilibrium among those studying homeostasis, (ii) utility estimation among those favoring neuroeconomic views, and (iii) approach and other instinctual behaviors among those cultivating neuroethological perspectives. Indeed, there are probably several distinct forms of positive affect, but all are closely related to ancient sub-neocortical limbic brain regions we share with other mammals. There is now a convergence of evidence to suggest that various regions of the limbic system, including especially ventral striatal dopamine systems are implemented in an anticipatory (appetitive) positive affective state. Dopamine independent mechanisms utilizing opiate and GABA receptors in the ventral striatum, amygdala and orbital frontal cortex are important in elaborating consummatory PA (i.e. sensory pleasure) states, and various neuropeptides mediate homeostatic satisfactions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

This model treats affect as reflecting the error signal of a feedback loop managing rate of incentive-seeking (and threat-avoidant) behaviour. In this view, positive feelings represent a sign that things are going better than necessary and are presumed to induce coasting. A tendency to coast is seen as facilitating the shift of attention and effort to other behavioural domains, where they may be needed more or where unforeseen opportunities have arisen. Such a function for positive feelings would permit the person both to maintain satisfactory standing with regard to multiple goals and to take advantage of unforeseen opportunities, thus providing adaptive value. Comparisons are made to other recently developed ideas concerning the functions of positive feelings.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

We review and integrate the different perspectives on positive emotions (i.e., positive valence, positive emotion regulation strategies, and positive adaptive function) and the four main mechanisms (i.e., cognition, affect, behavior, and physiology) that lead to positive organizational outcomes. There is growing evidence that positive emotions influence variables vital for workplace success such as positive beliefs, creativity, work engagement, positive coping, health, teamwork and collaboration, customer satisfaction, leadership, and performance. We additionally review dynamic features of positive emotions (i.e., intraindividual variability, reactivity, inertia, cycles, feedback loops) and their relation to psychological and work outcomes.

We first present a body of research showing that positive emotions broaden cognition and behavioral repertoires, and in so doing, build durable biopsychosocial resources that support coping and flourishing mental health. Next, by explicating the processes through which momentary experiences of emotions may accrue into self-perpetuating emotional systems, the current review proposes an underlying architecture of state-trait interactions that engenders lasting affective dispositions. This theoretical framework is then used to elucidate the cognitive-emotional mechanisms underpinning three disorders of affect regulation: depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. In turn, two mind training interventions, mindfulness and loving-kindness meditation, are highlighted as means of generating positive emotions that may counter the negative affective processes implicated in these disorders. We conclude with the proposition that positive emotions may exert a countervailing force on the dysphoric, fearful, or anhedonic states characteristic of psychopathologies typified by emotional dysfunctions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Eric L.

We hypothesize that an upward-spiral dynamic continually reinforces the tie between positive emotions and physical health and that this spiral is mediated by people\u2019s perceptions of their positive social connections. We tested this overarching hypothesis in a longitudinal field experiment in which participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group that self-generated positive emotions via loving-kindness meditation or to a waiting-list control group. Participants in the intervention group increased in positive emotions relative to those in the control group, an effect moderated by baseline vagal tone, a proxy index of physical health. Increased positive emotions, in turn, produced increases in vagal tone, an effect mediated by increased perceptions of social connections. This experimental evidence identifies one mechanism\u2014perceptions of social connections\u2014through which positive emotions build physical health, indexed as vagal tone. Results suggest that positive emotions, positive social connections, and physical health influence one another in a self-sustaining upward-spiral dynamic.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Bethany E.

Since the psychological process of reward is closely linked to pleasure, studies to elucidate the brain mechanisms of happiness have focused on the neural circuitry that processes reward information. Brain imaging studies have revealed that the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, insula, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area are the key areas related to happiness. When we consider the brain mechanisms of happiness, we need to distinguish between the neural mechanisms for liking and wanting, and between those that encode and cause pleasant feelings. Among these brain areas, subcortical structures participate in \u201cwanting\u201d, while cortical areas participate in \u201cliking\u201d. Orbitofrontal activity has been shown to encode the subjective experience of pleasure. However, it is not clear whether orbitofrontal activity actually causes pleasant feelings. Since the neuroscience of happiness is still in the primitive stage, further experiments are needed to elucidate the brain mechanisms of happiness.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

In a randomized, controlled one-week intervention study, we compared the \u2018three good things\u2019 and the \u2018three funny things\u2019 intervention with a placebo control. We assessed the positive and negative emotions reported daily during the intervention, and the well-being and depressive symptoms directly before, after, and one week after the intervention. Results showed higher intensity and variety of positive emotions elicited by the PPIs, and increases in well-being could be explained by the intensity and variety of positive emotions. The study provides a model for how the mechanisms underlying PPIs can be studied and underlines the relevance of positive emotions in PPIs.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;F.

Participants (n = 170) experiencing anxiety-induced cardiovascular reactivity viewed a film that elicited (a) contentment, (b) amusement, (c) neutrality, or (d) sadness. Contentment-eliciting and amusing films produced faster cardiovascular recovery than neutral or sad films did. Participants in Study 2 (n = 185) viewed these same films following a neutral state. Results disconfirm the alternative explanation that the undoing effect reflects a simple replacement process. Findings are contextualized by Fredrickson&#x27;s broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions (B. L. Fredrickson, 1998).&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;B. Fredrickson&quot;,&quot;R.

We propose that feeling and expressing positive emotions on the job have favorable consequences on: 1 employees independent of their relationships with others e.g., greater persistence, 2 reactions of others to employees e.g., \\&quot;halo,\\&quot; or overgeneralization to other desirable traits, and 3 reactions of employees to others e.g., helping others. These three sets of intervening processes are proposed, in turn, to lead to work achievement, job enrichment and a higher quality social context. A partial test of this framework is made in an 18-month study of 272 employees. Results indicate that positive emotion on the job at time 1 is associated with evidence of work achievement more favorable supervisor evaluations and higher pay and a supportive social context more support from supervisors and coworkers at time 2. But positive emotion at time 1 is not significantly associated with job enrichment at time 2.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Barry M. Staw&quot;,&quot;R. I. Sutton&quot;,&quot;L. H.

The broaden-and-build theory posits that experiences of positive emotions broaden people&#x27;s momentary thought-action repertoires, which in turn serves to build their enduring personal resources, ranging from physical and intellectual resources to social and psychological resources. Preliminary empirical evidence supporting the broaden-and-build theory is reviewed, and open empirical questions that remain to be tested are identified. The theory and findings suggest that the capacity to experience positive emotions may be a fundamental human strength central to the study of human flourishing.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;B.

Japanese and American college students (total N = 913) reported how frequently they experienced various emotional states in daily life. In support of the hypothesis, the reported frequency of general positive emotions (e.g. calm, elated) was most closely associated with the reported frequency of interpersonally engaged positive emotions (e.g. friendly feelings) in Japan, but with the reported frequency of interpersonally disengaged positive emotions (e.g. pride) in the United States. Further, for Americans the reported frequency of experience was considerably higher for positive emotions than for negative emotions, but for Japanese it was higher for engaged emotions than for disengaged emotions.

The broaden-and-build theory suggests that this is because positive emotions help people build lasting resources. To test this hypothesis, the authors measured emotions daily for 1 month in a sample of students (N = 86) and assessed life satisfaction and trait resilience at the beginning and end of the month. Positive emotions predicted increases in both resilience and life satisfaction. Negative emotions had weak or null effects and did not interfere with the benefits of positive emotions. Positive emotions also mediated the relation between baseline and final resilience, but life satisfaction did not. This suggests that it is in-the-moment positive emotions, and not more general positive evaluations of one&#x27;s life, that form the link between happiness and desirable life outcomes. Change in resilience mediated the relation between positive emotions and increased life satisfaction, suggesting that happy people become more satisfied not simply because they feel better but because they develop resources for living well.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

It has involved two phenomena referring to health. Positive emotions experienced by humans are not born spontaneously. Various good and pleasant things make us experience positive emotions. Those feelings make us enjoy life&#x27;s moments. As reported by Psychology Today, feeling positive emotions makes us healthier physically and mentally. Feeling it with others will also foster trust and compassion. Positive emotions will also keep people from stress. happy feelings are the emotions most often talked about and known. However, there are a variety of other positive emotions that are nuances of feeling happy. In 2009, psychologist Barbara Frederickson in her book Positivity identified 10 other positive emotions that are universally felt by humans in addition to feeling happy.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Carrie Lim Ching&quot;,&quot;Vivian Y.

Based on a review of East-West cultural differences in dialectical emotions, or co-occurring positive and negative feelings, we predicted culture to influence the association between positive emotions and depression, but not the association between negative emotions and depression. As predicted, in a survey of over 600 European-, immigrant Asian-, and Asian American college students, positive emotions were associated with depression symptoms among European Americans and Asian Americans, but not immigrant Asians. Negative emotions were associated with depression symptoms among all three groups. We also found initial evidence that acculturation (i.e., nativity) may influence the role of positive emotions in depression: Asian Americans fell \\&quot;in between\\&quot; the two other groups. These findings suggest the importance of studying the role of culture in positive emotions and in positive psychology. The use of interventions based on promoting positive emotions in clinical psychology among Asian clients is briefly discussed.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Janxin Leu&quot;,&quot;Jennifer M.

J. A. Russell and J. M. Carroll&#x27;s (1999) circumplex model holds that happiness and sadness are polar opposites and, thus, mutually exclusive. In contrast, the evaluative space model (J. T. Cacioppo &amp; G. G. Berntson, 1994) proposes that positive and negative affect are separable and that mixed feelings of happiness and sadness can co-occur. The authors both replicated and extended past research by showing that whereas most participants surveyed in typical situations felt either happy or sad, many participants surveyed immediately after watching the film Life Is Beautiful, moving out of their dormitories, or graduating from college felt both happy and sad. Results suggest that although affective experience may typically be bipolar, the underlying processes, and occasionally the resulting experience of emotion, are better characterized as bivariate.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jeff T.

Based on the research available, here\u2019s how we can separate positive states and immediate stimuli, and discuss their mechanisms:\n\n### Positive States:\n\nPositive states like happiness, contentment, and joy are generally broader and more enduring than responses to specific stimuli. They can be influenced by:\n\n1. **Psychological Resources**: Positive emotional states enhance psychological resources like resilience, optimism, and self-efficacy. They may improve physical well-being and promote healthier behaviors [(Salovey et al., 2000)](https://consensus.app/papers/states-health-salovey/c9eb87b520b859cbb5f6e88c49c30ec1/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n2. **Social Connections**: Positive emotions strengthen social connections, which are crucial for emotional and physical well-being. They foster trust, compassion, and broader social networks, enhancing an individual&#x27;s support system [(Fredrickson, 1998)](https://consensus.app/papers/what-good-positive-emotions-fredrickson/a535b0f0d83d5d868fe18409e2ee804d/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n3. **Coping Mechanisms**: Happiness and other positive emotions can lead to better coping mechanisms for stress and adversity, promoting resilience and a more balanced life satisfaction [(Cohn et al., 2009)](https://consensus.app/papers/happiness-unpacked-emotions-increase-life-satisfaction-cohn/fb4111b0a50257cf8f565ea47813882e/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n### Immediate Stimuli:\n\nImmediate stimuli that produce &#x27;feel-good&#x27; feelings can range from sensory experiences to specific events. These reactions can be more fleeting than broad emotional states but are powerful:\n\n1. **Neurobiological Responses**: Immediate pleasant stimuli often trigger direct neurobiological responses. For example, eating delicious food or listening to music can activate the brain&#x27;s reward pathways, releasing dopamine and other feel-good neurotransmitters, which induce pleasure and satisfaction [(Burgdorf &amp; Panksepp, 2006)](https://consensus.app/papers/neurobiology-emotions-burgdorf/eec9b7bfa4855b878ed63d3b78f87a91/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n2. **Sensory Pleasure**: The direct sensory pleasure from stimuli such as tastes, sounds, or visual art is processed in the brain&#x27;s sensory areas and limbic system, leading to immediate positive feelings [(Carver, 2003)](https://consensus.app/papers/pleasure-sign-attend-something-else-placing-feelings-carver/f1387f6706c8518e95e5c2cf4e2415e9/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n3. **Evaluative Responses**: Our cognitive appraisal of a situation or stimulus can quickly lead to positive feelings. This evaluation depends on personal values, current mood, and contextual factors. For example, receiving a compliment or achieving a goal can immediately generate feelings of pride and joy [(Yin, 2019)](https://consensus.app/papers/study-progress-neural-mechanism-positive-emotions-yin/81d62d707adc575a836980f192b06f33/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n### Mechanisms:\n\n1. **Neurological Pathways**: Both long-term positive states and immediate positive reactions involve complex neurological pathways. The limbic system, particularly the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex, plays a crucial role in processing positive emotions and stimuli [(Jie Yin, 2019)](https://consensus.app/papers/study-progress-neural-mechanism-positive-emotions-yin/81d62d707adc575a836980f192b06f33/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n2. **Broaden-and-Build Theory**: This theory suggests that positive emotions broaden an individual&#x27;s thought-action repertoire, leading to the building of enduring personal resources, which in turn contribute to improved well-being and further positive emotions [(Fredrickson, 2001)](https://consensus.app/papers/role-emotions-psychology-broadenandbuild-theory-fredrickson/f7343b806c1759bbb584074d5e4d45ac/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nIn summary, while positive states are typically broader and more enduring, influenced by psychological resources and social connections, immediate stimuli induce &#x27;feel-good&#x27; feelings through direct neurobiological reactions and sensory pleasures. Both are integral to the human experience of positivity and well-being."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "0e8c8232-84e1-4ccc-b69b-5e6c029272f3", "request_id": "864ec31aefb774e8-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "0e8c8232-84e1-4ccc-b69b-5e6c029272f3", "children": ["aaa25c47-3e62-4475-9283-53818e8a6a08"]}, "aaa25c47-3e62-4475-9283-53818e8a6a08": {"id": "aaa25c47-3e62-4475-9283-53818e8a6a08", "message": {"id": "aaa25c47-3e62-4475-9283-53818e8a6a08", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710529561.286843, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Give me a list of sources and study to continue and support the idea purported in the article below: \n\nThe Science of Feeling Good\n\nEveryone wants to feel good. Pleasure is a key aspect of life, and human beings seek out what gives them pleasure. We are naturally attracted to what makes us feel good. \n\n\nTake my favorite food, cheese, for instance. Scientific studies have revealed that cheese contains a chemical called casein, known for its ability to induce feelings of pleasure. This chemical is so powerful that it triggers the same brain regions as opioids, potentially leading to addictive behaviors. Yet, my intention is not addiction, but rather, to experience the joy that comes from feeling good. Hence, my love for cheese. \n\nBut it&#x27;s not just about the cheese. I often find myself pondering\u2014what truly brings us that feeling of goodness?  What are the essential elements that guarantee a delightful human experience? Is it all about chemical receptors in the brain? Is happiness just a pill or does it encompass something deeper? Is the true science of feeling good science or just a philosophy or attitude that keeps the human mood in optimal condition? Let\u2019s explore what we know about the science of feeling good and its intersections with behavioral philosophy and psychology to get the bottom of the mystery humans have pondered and sought for millennia: How to feel good all the time and lead a happy and meaningful life. \n\nSee, happiness isn\u2019t only the joy of chewing on a cube of sharp creamy cheesy cheddar. It is also the enduring feeling of goodness that comes from the sense that you\u2019re in a good place in your life right now.

We report two studies that examined core relational themes (Study 1) and expressive displays (Study 2) for eight positive emotion constructs\u2014amusement, awe, contentment, gratitude, interest, joy, love, and pride. Across studies, all eight emotions shared one quality: high positive valence. Distinctive core relational theme and expressive display patterns were found for four emotions\u2014amusement, awe, interest, and pride. Gratitude was associated with a distinct core relational theme but not an expressive display. Joy and love were each associated with a distinct expressive display but their core relational themes also characterised pride and gratitude, respectively. Contentment was associated with a distinct expressive display but not a core relational theme. The implications of this work for the study of positive emotion are discussed.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Belinda Campos&quot;,&quot;M. Shiota&quot;,&quot;D. Keltner&quot;,&quot;Gian C.

A key proposition is that these positive emotions broaden an individual&#x27;s momentary thought-action repertoire: joy sparks the urge to play, interest sparks the urge to explore, contentment sparks the urge to savour and integrate, and love sparks a recurring cycle of each of these urges within safe, close relationships. The broadened mindsets arising from these positive emotions are contrasted to the narrowed mindsets sparked by many negative emotions (i.e. specific action tendencies, such as attack or flee). A second key proposition concerns the consequences of these broadened mindsets: by broadening an individual&#x27;s momentary thought-action repertoire--whether through play, exploration or similar activities--positive emotions promote discovery of novel and creative actions, ideas and social bonds, which in turn build that individual&#x27;s personal resources; ranging from physical and intellectual resources, to social and psychological resources. Importantly, these resources function as reserves that can be drawn on later to improve the odds of successful coping and survival. This chapter reviews the latest empirical evidence supporting the broaden-and-build theory and draws out implications the theory holds for optimizing health and well-being.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;B.

A Case for a Sociology of the Good Life&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Despite the enormous growth in happiness research in recent decades, there remains a lack of consistency in the use of the terms happiness, satisfaction, contentment and well-being. In this article I argue for a sociologically grounded distinction between happiness and contentment that defines the former as positive affect and the latter as positive reflection. Contentment is therefore understood as a fulfilling relationship with the self and society (to borrow from G.H. Mead&#x27;s terminology) and happiness involves pleasurable experiences. There is a history of similar distinctions in philosophy and psychoanalysis, but much of the contemporary discourse fails to distinguish between individual and collective definitions of happiness. This article will argue that happiness and contentment ought not to be treated as competing approaches to the good life, but as complimentary forms of emotional experience. Further, I argue that the current interest in happiness can be linked to larger culture shifts involving neoliberalism and individualism.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

The broaden-and-build theory suggests that this is because positive emotions help people build lasting resources. To test this hypothesis, the authors measured emotions daily for 1 month in a sample of students (N = 86) and assessed life satisfaction and trait resilience at the beginning and end of the month. Positive emotions predicted increases in both resilience and life satisfaction. Negative emotions had weak or null effects and did not interfere with the benefits of positive emotions. Positive emotions also mediated the relation between baseline and final resilience, but life satisfaction did not. This suggests that it is in-the-moment positive emotions, and not more general positive evaluations of one&#x27;s life, that form the link between happiness and desirable life outcomes. Change in resilience mediated the relation between positive emotions and increased life satisfaction, suggesting that happy people become more satisfied not simply because they feel better but because they develop resources for living well.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

We report an investigation into the hypothesis that positive basic emotions have distinct vocal expressions (Ekman, 1992b, Cognition and Emotion, 6, 169\u2013200). Non-verbal vocalisations are used that map onto five putative positive emotions: Achievement/Triumph, Amusement, Contentment, Sensual Pleasure, and Relief. Data from categorisation and rating tasks indicate that each vocal expression is accurately categorised and consistently rated as expressing the intended emotion. This pattern is replicated across two language groups. These data, we conclude, provide evidence for the existence of robustly recognisable expressions of distinct positive emotions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Disa Sauter&quot;,&quot;S.

The goal of this study was to establish the features of facial and upper-body displays participants associate with the experience of distinct positive emotions.

There is probably a point beyond which enjoyment interferes with realism, yet it is unclear where that point is. The original \u201cStates of Mind\u201d (SOM) model (Schwartz and Garamoni, 1986; 1989) proposed that a ratio of [positive] to [positive plus negative] affective/cognitive states [P/(P+N)] of about 0.62 is optimal, but previous research indicated that higher ratios may go with good mental health. The revised \u201cbalanced states of mind\u201d (BSOM) model (Schwartz, 1997) suggests a higher cutoff, with ratios above 0.90 being dysfunctional. This paper reports a study of 72 very positive subjects (mean ratio = 0.85) and assessed possible dysfunction by means of questionnaires, role-plays, and physiological responses to induced stress. Signs of dysfunction were no more frequent among the most positive subjects (ratios of 0.90 and above) than among moderately positive subjects. This suggests that there is nothing wrong with the high levels of happiness in present day society. As yet, it is still not established how much more happiness will be too much. One possibility is that standard cognition/emotion measures need to be revised in order to detect truly excessive positivity in a sensitive manner.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Elisha Tarlow Friedman&quot;,&quot;R.

The authors suggest a conceptual model to account for these findings, arguing that the happiness-success link exists not only because success makes people happy, but also because positive affect engenders success. Three classes of evidence--crosssectional, longitudinal, and experimental--are documented to test their model. Relevant studies are described and their effect sizes combined meta-analytically. The results reveal that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes, as well as behaviors paralleling success. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that positive affect--the hallmark of well-being--may be the cause of many of the desirable characteristics, resources, and successes correlated with happiness. Limitations, empirical issues, and important future research questions are discussed.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S. Lyubomirsky&quot;,&quot;L. King&quot;,&quot;E.

Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Happiness can be defined in terms of a mental state of satisfaction and contentment; positive feelings/emotions; a harmonious homeostasis; achievement and hope; and freedom from ill-being (Lu, Gilmour, &amp; Kao, 2001). However, happiness is not a static state. Even the happiest of people the cheeriest 10%feel blue at times. And even the bluest has their moments of joy. That has presented a challenge to social scientists trying to measure happiness. Happiness is a mental state of well-being characterized by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy.Happiness is defined (a) as a predominance of positive over negative affect and (b) as satisfaction with life as a whole (Argyle, Martin, &amp; Crossland, 1989). Philosophers have commonly distinguished two accounts of happiness: hedonism, and the life satisfaction theory. Hedonists identify happiness with the individual&#x27;s balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience whereas Life satisfaction theories identify happiness with having a favourable attitude toward one&#x27;s life as a whole. A third theory, the emotional state view identifies happiness with an agent&#x27;s emotional condition as a whole (Eid &amp; Larson, 2008). In addition, happiness is conceptualized better as a trait than as a transient emotional state (Veenhoven, 1994). Thus, to understand why some people are happier than others, one must understand the cognitive and motivational processes that serve to maintain, and even enhance, enduring happiness and transient mood (Lyubomirsky, 2001). Subjective Wellbeing researchers have progressed from early survey searches for \\&quot;objective\\&quot; external indicators (Andrews &amp; Withey, 1976) and scale development (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985) to explanations of psychological mechanisms of happiness (Lu &amp; Lin, 1998) and even to large-scale cross-cultural comparisons (Diener, Diener, &amp; Diener, 1995).Factors that affect happiness of a person range from internal sources to external sources, right from genetic influences to social situation, personality, momentary events and so on. Chance events like personal tragedies or illness might affect ones happiness but the effect does not remain long (Diener, 2000). Proximal environment like the social class, community, family and economic situation has their effect on well being of a person. At the same time, factors like hope and optimism can be learned to moderate one&#x27;s level of happiness (Seligman, 2002). There are three components of happiness: pleasure (\\&quot;the smiley-face piece\\&quot;), engagement (the depth of involvement with one&#x27;s family, work, romance and hobbies) and meaning (using personal strengths to serve some larger end). Of those three roads to a happy, satisfied life, pleasure is the least consequential and engagement and meaning are much more important\\&quot; (Davis, 2014).People vary in their perception of happiness at different stages of their life and education also plays a role in it. So in order to understand the phenomena from the perspective of research scholars and to compare their level of happiness across gender, the present study was carried out.MethodParticipantsA sample of 60 research scholars equally divided into male (n=30) and female (n=30) groups, were taken from Jamia Millia Islamia. They were enrolled in Ph.D programme in different departments of both science and social science streams. The age of the scholars ranged from 24 to 28 years.InstrumentsThe Subjective Happiness Scale: The scale was developed by Lyubomirsky and Lepper in 1999 and measures the extent to which an individual sees himself or herself as a happy or unhappy person. It comprises four questions and measures response on 7 point rating scale.Open ended questions on sources of happiness: Few questions were made asking about various sources of happiness. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

No wonder then that in this chaotic reality and despite various joyful and satisfying moments, the majority of grown-ups claim that they are unhappy. Amazingly, however, there are always those who believe and declare that they are happy, which raises the question what is happiness and what is it constituted from. Google suggests that \u201cHappiness is that feeling that comes over you when you know life is good and you can\u2019t help but smile. It\u2019s the opposite of sadness. Happiness is a sense of well-being, joy, or contentment. When people are successful, or safe, or lucky, they feel happy\u201d. This description combines a number of positive experiences and feelings, that most likely affect our brain to release chemicals recognized as the \u2018good guys\u2019, in contrast to the \u2018bad guys\u2019, chemicals secreted in situations of sadness, agony, pain, failures, disappointments and frustrations that affect brain circuits associated with unpleasant emotions and thoughts. Although moments of satisfaction, joy and pleasure raise good feelings, these are usually temporary, whereas happiness in its broader essence reflects a positive state of mind based on numerous parameters that collectively raise a long-lasting contentment. When a person claims he is happy, he probably disregards his difficulties and concentrates on a particular issue that makes him feel good (e.g., love, professional success, good health, overcoming a major difficulty, listening to beloved music, winning in sport).&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Gurevitz M&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2022,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Annals of Depression and Anxiety&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/happiness-evasive-state-mind-m/196f661fad845a63b19f22d5517d2507/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.26420/anndepressanxiety.2022.1114&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:13},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Positive affect and health-related neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and inflammatory processes.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Negative affective states such as depression are associated with premature mortality and increased risk of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and disability. It has been suggested that positive affective states are protective, but the pathways through which such effects might be mediated are poorly understood. Here we show that positive affect in middle-aged men and women is associated with reduced neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and cardiovascular activity. Positive affect was assessed by aggregating momentary experience samples of happiness over a working day and was inversely related to cortisol output over the day, independently of age, gender, socioeconomic position, body mass, and smoking. Similar patterns were observed on a leisure day. Happiness was also inversely related to heart rate assessed by using ambulatory monitoring methods over the day. Participants underwent mental stress testing in the laboratory, where plasma fibrinogen stress responses were smaller in happier individuals. These effects were independent of psychological distress, supporting the notion that positive well-being is directly related to health-relevant biological processes.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Participants experienced happy, neutral, or sad moods and \\&quot;remembered\\&quot; whether names connoting race (African American, European American) belonged to social categories (criminal, politician, basketball player). Positive mood increased reliance on heuristics, indexed by higher false identification of members of stereotyped groups. Positive mood lowered sensitivity (d&#x27;), even among relative experts, and shifted bias (beta) or criterion to be more lenient for stereotypical names. In contrast, sad mood did not disrupt sensitivity and, in fact, revealed the use of a stricter criterion compared with baseline mood. Results support theories that characterize happy mood as a mental state that predisposes reliance on heuristics and sad mood as dampening such reliance.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jaihyun Park&quot;,&quot;M.

Biological theories conceptualize PA as being related to (i) signals indicating that bodies are returning to equilibrium among those studying homeostasis, (ii) utility estimation among those favoring neuroeconomic views, and (iii) approach and other instinctual behaviors among those cultivating neuroethological perspectives. Indeed, there are probably several distinct forms of positive affect, but all are closely related to ancient sub-neocortical limbic brain regions we share with other mammals. There is now a convergence of evidence to suggest that various regions of the limbic system, including especially ventral striatal dopamine systems are implemented in an anticipatory (appetitive) positive affective state. Dopamine independent mechanisms utilizing opiate and GABA receptors in the ventral striatum, amygdala and orbital frontal cortex are important in elaborating consummatory PA (i.e. sensory pleasure) states, and various neuropeptides mediate homeostatic satisfactions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

For this reason, campaigns aimed at promoting the value of positive emotion have become widespread. What is rarely considered are the cultural implications of this focus on happiness. Promoting positive emotions as important for \\&quot;the good life\\&quot; not only has implications for how individuals value these emotional states, but for how they believe others around them value these emotions also. Drawing on data from over 9,000 college students across 47 countries we examined whether individuals&#x27; life satisfaction is associated with living in contexts in which positive emotions are socially valued. The findings show that people report more life satisfaction in countries where positive emotions are highly valued and this is linked to an increased frequency of positive emotional experiences in these contexts. They also reveal, however, that increased life satisfaction in countries that place a premium on positive emotion is less evident for people who tend to experience less valued emotional states: people who experience many negative emotions, do not flourish to the same extent in these contexts. The findings demonstrate how the cultural value placed on certain emotion states may shape the relationship between emotional experiences and subjective well-being.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;B.

Using the latent state-trait model analysis, which takes both intraindividual variability and interindividual difference into account by controlling measurement error, it was shown that the variability could be measured reliably by the scores of theCOPAS. In particular, a total of 56.9% to 63.5% and 48.2% to 60.6% of the reliable interindividual difference in positive and negative affect, respectively,was attributed to the intraindividual variability.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Tomoyuki Yasuda&quot;,&quot;C.

Three hundred and ninety-eight undergraduate students from Singapore participated in this study. First, states-of-mind ratio and positive automatic thoughts were positively correlated with life satisfaction and happiness, and negatively correlated with anxiety, depression, and anger. In contrast, negative automatic thoughts were positively correlated with anxiety, depression, and anger, and negatively correlated with life satisfaction and happiness. Second, the BSOM categories based depression-related automatic thoughts was able to significantly differentiate among levels of depression, happiness, life satisfaction, anxiety, and anger in ANOVA and in terms of variance accounted for as indicated by partial Eta squared. Third, the BSOM ratio was the best predictor for happiness and life satisfaction and second best predictor for depression, anxiety, and anger in terms of variance accounted for as indicated by adjusted R2, in comparison to the negative cognition model and positive cognition model. Fourth, both ANOVA results and multiple regression results showed that there is cognitive content-specificity for the BSOM based on depression-related automatic thoughts. Implications and limitations of these findings were discussed.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

These emotions also build lasting personal resources, contributing to emotional well-being and resilience.\n\n2. **Salovey et al. (2000)**: The research highlights the connection between positive emotional states and physical health. Positive emotions can improve health through various pathways, including direct physiological effects on the immune system, fostering healthier behaviors, and improving social support.\n\n3. **Campos et al. (2013)**: This study explores the distinct core relational themes and expressive displays associated with different positive emotions. It suggests that while all positive emotions share high positive valence, they differ significantly in their core relational themes and facial/body expressions.\n\n4. **Fredrickson (2004)**: The paper expands on the broaden-and-build theory, explaining how positive emotions broaden an individual\u2019s thought-action repertoire and build enduring resources, which in turn enhance coping mechanisms and overall well-being.\n\n5. **McKenzie (2016)**: The article argues for a distinction between happiness (positive affect) and contentment (positive reflection), proposing that happiness is associated with pleasurable experiences, while contentment stems from a fulfilling relationship with oneself and society.\n\n6. **Cohn et al. (2009)**: The authors demonstrate that daily positive emotions increase life satisfaction and resilience, underscoring the idea that in-the-moment positive emotions, rather than general positive evaluations of one\u2019s life, are crucial for happiness and well-being.\n\n7. **Sauter &amp; Scott (2007)**: This research suggests that different positive emotions have distinct vocal expressions and that these unique emotional sounds can be accurately recognized and differentiated by others, highlighting the complexity of positive emotional expression.\n\n8. **Salovey et al.

Pleasure is a key aspect of life, and human beings seek out what gives them pleasure. We are naturally attracted to what makes us feel good. \n\n\nTake my favorite food, cheese, for instance. Scientific studies have revealed that cheese contains a chemical called casein, known for its ability to induce feelings of pleasure. This chemical is so powerful that it triggers the same brain regions as opioids, potentially leading to addictive behaviors. Yet, my intention is not addiction, but rather, to experience the joy that comes from feeling good. Hence, my love for cheese. \n\nBut it&#x27;s not just about the cheese. I often find myself pondering\u2014what truly brings us that feeling of goodness? What are the essential elements that guarantee a delightful human experience? Is it all about chemical receptors in the brain? Is happiness just a pill or does it encompass something deeper? Is the true science of feeling good science or just a philosophy or attitude that keeps the human mood in optimal condition? Let\u2019s explore what we know about the science of feeling good and its intersections with behavioral philosophy and psychology to get the bottom of the mystery humans have pondered and sought for millennia: How to feel good all the time and lead a happy and meaningful life. \n\nSee, happiness isn\u2019t only the joy of chewing on a cube of sharp creamy cheesy cheddar. It is also the enduring feeling of goodness that comes from the sense that you\u2019re in a good place in your life right now. It\u2019s the feeling of goodness that comes from dwelling in a positive state. \n\nWhat We Know So Far:\nPositive states such as contentment, general happiness, and joy\n--------\n\nCan you use these studies to finish up this blog post above and end with a list of 5 science-supported methods of using immediate happiness-inducing stimuli to build long-lasting positive states such  as contentment, good physical and mental health, purposefulness, direction, etc., and spend particular time discussing the distinctions sited in McKenzie (2016)"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "864ed90e18a0a25c-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4ec0b408-acec-4ed6-9ffd-29b7d2d0c71f", "children": ["60efbf63-309a-4c43-972d-469c6d107220"]}, "60efbf63-309a-4c43-972d-469c6d107220": {"id": "60efbf63-309a-4c43-972d-469c6d107220", "message": {"id": "60efbf63-309a-4c43-972d-469c6d107220", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710530331.67054, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Building on our understanding of the science of feeling good, we know that while the immediate pleasure from experiences like enjoying cheese taps into our brain&#x27;s reward system, true happiness extends far beyond these transient moments of joy. It encompasses enduring states of contentment, health, purposefulness, and direction in life.\n\nFrom the research findings summarized earlier:\n\n1. **Broaden-and-Build Theory (Fredrickson, 1998 &amp; 2004)**: This theory suggests that experiencing positive emotions broadens one&#x27;s awareness and encourages novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this leads to building enduring personal resources, ranging from physical and social resources to intellectual and psychological capacities.\n\n2. **Positive Emotions and Health (Salovey et al., 2000)**: Positive emotional states not only enhance mental health but are also linked to physical well-being. They can lead to healthier lifestyles and may even have direct physiological benefits, such as on the immune system.\n\n3. **Distinctions of Positive Emotions (Campos et al., 2013)**: Different positive emotions serve different functions and lead to distinct types of satisfaction and well-being. For example, joy might lead to playing and creativity, while contentment might encourage reflection and appreciation.\n\n4. **Sociology of Happiness (McKenzie, 2016)**: Happiness (positive affect) and contentment (positive reflection) are distinguished. While happiness can be fleeting and dependent on external factors, contentment is more about a fulfilling relationship with oneself and society. This distinction is crucial as it underscores the different pathways through which we can cultivate a good life: one through seeking pleasurable experiences and the other through fostering a deep sense of satisfaction with life.\n\n5. **Expression and Recognition of Emotions (Sauter &amp; Scott, 2007; Shiota et al., 2003)**: The way we express and recognize different positive emotions can affect our relationships and social interactions, further influencing our overall well-being.\n\nBuilding on these insights, here are five science-supported methods to use immediate happiness-inducing stimuli to build long-lasting positive states:\n\n1. **Cultivate a Variety of Positive Emotions**: Engage in activities that foster a range of positive emotions. For example, engage in playful activities to experience joy, immerse yourself in nature to feel awe, and practice gratitude to feel more content. Diversifying your emotional experiences can broaden your thought-action repertoires and build lasting resources.\n\n2. **Practice Mindfulness and Reflection**: Spend time in self-reflection to understand what brings you genuine contentment, beyond mere fleeting pleasure. Mindfulness practices can help you become more aware of your internal states, leading to a deeper sense of contentment.\n\n3. **Build and Maintain Social Connections**: Foster relationships that provide support, validation, and love. Strong social ties can lead to enduring feelings of love and belonging, key components of long-term well-being.\n\n4. **Set and Pursue Purposeful Goals**: Having clear goals and a sense of direction can lead to feelings of success and accomplishment. Choose goals that are aligned with your values and interests to ensure they contribute to your overall sense of purpose and contentment.\n\n5. **Adopt Healthy Lifestyle Habits**: Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep can improve your mood and energy levels, leading to more frequent and intense experiences of positive emotions, which over time contribute to lasting well-being.\n\nBy understanding the distinctions between fleeting happiness and deeper contentment, as highlighted by McKenzie (2016), we can strive not just for momentary pleasures but for a fulfilling and meaningful life. It&#x27;s about balancing the joy of immediate pleasures with activities and relationships that provide a profound sense of satisfaction and belonging. This comprehensive approach can guide us towards a life that is not only happy but also rich, purposeful, and rewarding."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "pad": "AAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2acbb-c6c1-44c6-844b-8e4a67349850", "request_id": "864ed90e18a0a25c-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2acbb-c6c1-44c6-844b-8e4a67349850", "children": ["aaa2deb4-8e7a-44d3-bbfc-3f801d618a89"]}, "aaa2deb4-8e7a-44d3-bbfc-3f801d618a89": {"id": "aaa2deb4-8e7a-44d3-bbfc-3f801d618a89", "message": {"id": "aaa2deb4-8e7a-44d3-bbfc-3f801d618a89", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710530455.254617, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["write 3 paragraphs that summarize the current knowledge and trends in the science of feeling good"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "864edd0f79030d80-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "60efbf63-309a-4c43-972d-469c6d107220", "children": ["f3b02f87-d77f-4fcc-bad0-bf48f6ca1c17"]}, "f3b02f87-d77f-4fcc-bad0-bf48f6ca1c17": {"id": "f3b02f87-d77f-4fcc-bad0-bf48f6ca1c17", "message": {"id": "f3b02f87-d77f-4fcc-bad0-bf48f6ca1c17", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710530483.248044, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The science of feeling good, an area deeply explored within positive psychology, illuminates the multifaceted nature of happiness and well-being. Central to this field is the distinction between transient pleasures and enduring states of contentment, which has been crucially outlined in recent studies and theories. The broaden-and-build theory by Fredrickson emphasizes that positive emotions extend beyond fleeting moments, serving to expand our cognitive, social, and emotional resources, which in turn foster resilience and long-term well-being. Moreover, findings by Salovey et al. demonstrate the significant impact of positive emotional states on physical health, suggesting a bi-directional relationship between psychological well-being and physiological health. This body of work suggests that while immediate joy from stimuli like food or entertainment is valid, true, lasting happiness encompasses deeper, more sustained states such as contentment, purposefulness, and social connection.\n\nResearch has also delved into the nuances of positive emotions, highlighting the diversity and specificity of feelings such as joy, pride, gratitude, and love. Studies by Campos et al. and others underline that each positive emotion carries unique expressions and functions, contributing differently to our overall well-being. This specificity underscores the importance of cultivating a broad range of positive emotions to enhance various aspects of personal and social life. Furthermore, the work of McKenzie brings a sociological perspective, distinguishing between happiness as an immediate, affective experience and contentment as a reflective, evaluative state. This distinction is critical as it suggests different paths to achieving a fulfilling life: one through the pursuit of enjoyable experiences and the other through the development of a satisfying life narrative and social integration.\n\nIn light of these insights, current trends in the science of feeling good are moving towards a more holistic understanding of well-being, integrating emotional, cognitive, social, and physiological components. This comprehensive approach advocates for a balanced life that values both the pursuit of pleasure and the cultivation of meaningful relationships, purposeful goals, and a healthy lifestyle. As research continues to unfold, it is increasingly clear that long-term happiness and well-being are complex, multi-dimensional constructs that require intentional effort and a broad strategy encompassing various aspects of human experience. The ongoing exploration in this field continues to offer valuable insights into how individuals can navigate the pursuit of happiness in an increasingly complex and changing world."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2deb4-8e7a-44d3-bbfc-3f801d618a89", "request_id": "864edd0f79030d80-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2deb4-8e7a-44d3-bbfc-3f801d618a89", "children": ["aaa2d9c6-cfa0-4cc6-83de-a86e1c10b828"]}, "aaa2d9c6-cfa0-4cc6-83de-a86e1c10b828": {"id": "aaa2d9c6-cfa0-4cc6-83de-a86e1c10b828", "message": {"id": "aaa2d9c6-cfa0-4cc6-83de-a86e1c10b828", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1710530820.813628, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I&#x27;d like to read the full text of this article"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"targeted_reply": "McKenzie, J.

The European style machines are typically more compact and energy-efficient due to this technology.\n\nHeat pump dryers in these combo units work by using a closed-loop heat exchange system to recirculate hot air within the drum, removing moisture from the clothes without venting hot air outside. This makes them more energy-efficient but also results in longer drying times compared to standard, vented dryers. This is a key feature of many European-style washer/dryer combos and a reason for their growing popularity in environments where space is limited and energy efficiency is valued, such as apartments or homes without easy external venting options."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa25e39-db4a-4a80-a45f-12a5c74a7bce", "request_id": "8607cb4f19cb74e2-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa25e39-db4a-4a80-a45f-12a5c74a7bce", "children": ["aaa2a900-9084-44ce-9915-43f4f170c18e"]}, "aaa2a900-9084-44ce-9915-43f4f170c18e": {"id": "aaa2a900-9084-44ce-9915-43f4f170c18e", "message": {"id": "aaa2a900-9084-44ce-9915-43f4f170c18e", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709785354.333306, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["a friend told me once, who use the euro style washer that his clothes never really felt dry.

This is due to several factors:\n\n1. **Combined functionality**: Combos are both washing and drying in the same drum, which can lead to less effective drying compared to dedicated dryers.\n\n2. **Condenser drying**: Earlier models often used condenser drying rather than heat pump technology. In condenser dryers, the moisture is condensed into water and drained away, but this process is less energy-efficient and can be less effective in very humid conditions.\n\n3. **Load size and overloading**: Combos typically have smaller capacities than standalone machines. Overloading the machine can significantly reduce drying effectiveness, leaving clothes feeling damp.\n\n4. **Environmental factors**: The ambient air in colder, more humid climates like Minnesota can affect the drying efficiency of condenser and heat pump dryers alike.\n\nSince 2007, however, there have been significant improvements in washer/dryer combo technologies, including more efficient and effective heat pump (pompa di calore) systems. These newer models are generally better at drying clothes, though they may still not feel as &quot;bone dry&quot; immediately after the cycle as they would coming out of a traditional vented dryer. Nonetheless, for those with space constraints or energy efficiency in mind, modern European-style combos are a much-improved option. If someone is experiencing issues with their clothes not drying well, they should consider the load size, machine settings, and whether the machine&#x27;s technology suits their climate and living situation."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2a900-9084-44ce-9915-43f4f170c18e", "request_id": "8607ce1effe2a325-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2a900-9084-44ce-9915-43f4f170c18e", "children": ["aaa22a3c-6d83-44bd-ae2c-8e9a1ff0d019"]}, "aaa22a3c-6d83-44bd-ae2c-8e9a1ff0d019": {"id": "aaa22a3c-6d83-44bd-ae2c-8e9a1ff0d019", "message": {"id": "aaa22a3c-6d83-44bd-ae2c-8e9a1ff0d019", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709785432.601957, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["thanks. i like you.  you know those 110 volt apartment sized tumble dryers?

Typically, newer models, especially those from well-known brands like Beko, tend to be more energy-efficient, especially if they use heat pump technology.\n\nIf you&#x27;re trying to assess the carbon footprint, the crucial information would be the energy consumption (kWh per cycle or per year) and whether your local electricity grid relies more on fossil fuels or renewable resources. \n\nFor Rome, Italy, if we have the energy consumption data, we can use the average greenhouse gas emissions factor for Italy to estimate the carbon footprint.

Well For one thing. Let me tell you the rules. I Feel like once you know the rules you understand what a thing is. Someone from every place must opt in for collective communism to work. Collective communism initially should be a movement by which people across the world decide to pool resources and maintain a community that is global. Now I know this concept already exists you might say. This concept exists and is known as the global community like the global internet community but imagine you had a global resource community? right like to put it in la di da di terms, it&#x27;s like imagine that...that expression that everyone says that like, the earth belongs to humanity and the world is ours really applied and everything belonged to everyone. Right? If everything belonged everyone, right, that would be collective communism. So, as of now, as all of humanity has not yet opted into collective Communism, we can only exists as a subset of the current community but even so this is the movement I would like to start the collective communism movement and the point of it all is that as many people opt-in across the world as want to and we all pool our resources and I think it would over time if there was like a big enough movement, it would be like, not only do we all pool our resources, we uhh...we do not. We never create any sort of centralized repository. Collective communism is based around the idea of a communal sharing of resources, ideas and freedoms, and at the same time, the focus does come back to resources. A communal sharing of resources.

What is Collective Communism, you ask? Well, let me tell you the rules. For one thing, someone from every place must opt in for Collective Communism to work. Initially, Collective Communism should be a movement by which people across the world decide to pool resources and maintain a global community.\n\nNow, I know you might say this concept already exists and is known as the global community, like the global internet community. But imagine if we had a global resource community? It&#x27;s like the expression that everyone says \u2013 that the earth belongs to humanity and the world is ours \u2013 really applied, and everything belonged to everyone. If everything belonged to everyone, that would be Collective Communism.\n\nAs of now, as all of humanity has not yet opted into Collective Communism, we can only exist as a subset of the current community. But even so, this is the movement I would like to start: the Collective Communism movement. The point of it all is that as many people opt in across the world as want to, and we all pool our resources. Over time, if there was a big enough movement, it would be like, not only do we all pool our resources, but we never create any sort of centralized repository.\n\nCollective Communism is based around the idea of communal sharing of resources, ideas, and freedoms. At the same time, the focus does come back to resources \u2013 a communal sharing of resources. Meaning that, ideally, wherever a Collective Communist was in any place in the world, they&#x27;d have a home and a place to lay their head, because in Collective Communism, there is no personal property. Only shared resources. I know, cray, right?
