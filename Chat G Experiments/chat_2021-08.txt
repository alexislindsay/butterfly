After an introduction to the problem of overcoming social dilemmas\n\nthrough collective ac t io ,th e  remainder of this article is divided into six sections. The first briefly reviews the\ntheoretical predictions of curently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second\nsection summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by\nextensive erperimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to\nshow how individuals achieve results that are &quot;better than rational&quot; by building conditions where reciprocity,\nreputation  and trust can help to overcome the stong temptations of short-nun self-interest. The fourth\nsection raises the possibiliry of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops\nan  initial theoretical sc ea rio , and the  final section concludes by examining the implications o f  placing\nreciprocity reputation  and  trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.\n\nwe are hand-waving at  our central questions. I am\nafraid that  we do a lot of hand-waving.\n\net me start with a provocative statement. You\nwould not be reading this article if it were not for\nsome of our ancestors learning how to undertake\n\ncollective action to solve social dilem mas. Successive\ngenerations have added to the stock of everyday knowl-\nedge about how to instill productive norms of behavior\nin their children and to craft rules to support collective\naction that produces public goods and avoids &quot;trage-\ndies of the commons.&quot;I What our ancestors and con-\ntemporaries have learned about engaging in collective\naction for mutual defense,child rearing,and survival is\nnot , however, understood or explained by the extant\ntheory of collective action.\n\nThe lessons of effective collective action are not\nsimple\u2014as is obvious from human history and the\nimmense tragedies that humans have endured ,as  well\nas the successes we have realized. As global relation-\nships become even more intricately intertwined and\ncomplex,however, our survival becomes more depen-\ndent on empirically grounded scientific understanding.\nWe have not yet developed a behavioral theory of\ncollective action based on models of the individual\nconsistent with empirical evidence about how individ-\nuals make decisions in social-dilemma situations. A\nbehavioralcommitment to theory grounded in empir-\nical inquiry is essential if we are to understand such\nbasic questions as why face-to-face communication so\nconsistently enhances cooperation in social dilemmas\nor how structural variables facilitate or impede cffec-\ntive collective action.\n\nSocial dilemmas occur whenever individuals in inter-\ndependent situations face choices in which the maxi-\nmization of short-term self-interest yields outcomes\nleaving all participants worse off than feasible alterna-\ntives. In a public-good dilemma, for example, all those\nwho would benefit from the provision of a public\ngood\u2014such as pollution control, radio broadcasts  or\nweather forecasting\u2014find it costly to contribute and\nwould prefer others to pay for the good instead. If\neveryone follows the equilibrium strategy, then the\ngood is not provided or  is underprovided  Yet, every-\none would be better off if everyone were to contribute.\n\nSocial dilemmas are found in all aspects of life,\nleading to momentous decisions affecting war and\npeace as well as the mundane relationships of keeping\npromises in everyday life.Social dilemmas are called by\nmany names, including the public-good or collective-\ngood problem(Olson 1965, P.  Samuelson 1954),shirk-\ning(Alchian and Demsetz 1972), the free-rider prob-\nlem(Edney 1979,Grossman and Hart 1980),moral\nhazard(Holmstrom 1982),the credible commitment\ndilemma(Williams, Collins, and Lichbach 1997), gen-\neralized social exchange (Ekch 1974; Emerson 1972a,\n\nYet, the theory of collective action is the central\nsubject of political science  It is the core of the justifi-\ncation for the state.

She argues that traditional models of rationality fail to account for how individuals collectively overcome social dilemmas. Instead, she points to empirical evidence suggesting that individuals can achieve outcomes better than those predicted by rational choice theory through the development of social norms like reciprocity, reputation, and trust.\n\nThe article outlines the limitations of current rational choice theories and highlights the importance of empirical research in understanding how collective action can be facilitated in practice. Ostrom suggests the necessity of developing &quot;second-generation&quot; models of rationality that better reflect observed behaviors in social dilemmas.\n\nThis address serves as a pivotal point for political science and related disciplines, urging a reevaluation of how theories of collective action are conceptualized and applied, especially in complex and interdependent global relationships.\n\nFor a detailed exploration and specific textual references from the article, consider viewing the document through a PDF viewer or upgrading to AI Drive Pro for enhanced features and document access."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAA", "parent_id": "642e1f76-74ae-47da-8e86-8bae4687af71", "request_id": "87d43e01e80b0e52-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "642e1f76-74ae-47da-8e86-8bae4687af71", "children": ["aaa2bf9e-8783-4be6-915d-20554278f548"]}, "aaa2bf9e-8783-4be6-915d-20554278f548": {"id": "aaa2bf9e-8783-4be6-915d-20554278f548", "message": {"id": "aaa2bf9e-8783-4be6-915d-20554278f548", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714613476.263819, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["what is rational choice theory?

These decisions are often modeled as attempts to maximize benefits while minimizing costs. The theory is used extensively in economics, sociology, and political science to model human behavior in various contexts, from market transactions to social interactions and political decision-making.\n\n### Key Points of Rational Choice Theory:\n\n1. **Self-Interest**: It posits that individuals act in their own best interest, carefully weighing the costs and benefits of possible alternatives before making decisions.\n\n2. **Utility Maximization**: The core idea is that individuals seek to maximize their utility, or satisfaction, from the choices they make.\n\n3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Decisions are made by comparing the expected costs against the benefits of an action. A rational actor would only engage in an action if the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\n4. **Preferences**: Individuals have clear and consistent preferences among the available choice alternatives that allow them to order these choices.\n\n5. **Optimal Decision**: It assumes that individuals have the capability and necessary information to assess the choices available to them and select the best possible option according to their goals and constraints.\n\n### Applications and Criticisms:\n\n- **Applications**: Rational choice theory is foundational in theories of market behavior and is also used for models in other social sciences, such as sociology and political science, to explain phenomena like voting behavior, crime, and family relationships.\n\n- **Criticisms**: Critics argue that the theory may oversimplify human behavior, ignoring emotional, ethical, and social influences that can also significantly impact decision-making processes. Critics also point out that access to complete information and the capacity to process it are often unrealistic.\n\nDespite criticisms, rational choice theory remains a fundamental concept used to understand and predict decisions in a broad array of academic fields and practical applications."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "aaa2bf9e-8783-4be6-915d-20554278f548", "request_id": "87d44030bdaa0e6f-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2bf9e-8783-4be6-915d-20554278f548", "children": ["aaa2a082-27c8-4d0d-aabc-da46d56e81bd"]}, "aaa2a082-27c8-4d0d-aabc-da46d56e81bd": {"id": "aaa2a082-27c8-4d0d-aabc-da46d56e81bd", "message": {"id": "aaa2a082-27c8-4d0d-aabc-da46d56e81bd", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714613687.945784, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["give me and outline and  summary of the article and the key ideas presented"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-Ncpmu4wKrkhcdiuraEkfqWZq", "size": 645483, "name": "Week 1_Two Enduring Lessons from Elinor Ostrom.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf"}], "request_id": "87d4455ae8f24c6d-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "3db0fc70-cb4a-434c-9d7a-d1ff32671c2c", "children": ["2b651537-5bd1-4693-a5f0-d629eaebb05e"]}, "2b651537-5bd1-4693-a5f0-d629eaebb05e": {"id": "2b651537-5bd1-4693-a5f0-d629eaebb05e", "message": {"id": "2b651537-5bd1-4693-a5f0-d629eaebb05e", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714613706.931212, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "file-Ncpmu4wKrkhcdiuraEkfqWZq", "domain": "Week 1_Two Enduring Lessons from Elinor Ostrom.pdf", "text": "\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nBenjamin N.

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).  In honor of the couple, IU renamed the workshop, The \n\nVincent and Elinor Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.   \n13 See International Association for the Study of the Commons (2012b). \n14 For more details, see International Association for the Study of the Commons (2012a). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\nhttp://www.iasc-commons.org/commons-digest\nhttp://www.iasc-commons.org/commons-digest\nhttp://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nII. Applying Ostrom\u2019s Lessons to Commons in the Cultural Environment (or Knowledge \n\nCommons) \n\nOstrom may be most well known among environmental scholars, but her lessons extend well \n\nbeyond natural environmental resources.  Here, I focus on commons in the cultural environment.  \n\nThis label sometimes confuses people; so let me briefly explain.  I use the term \u201ccultural \n\nenvironment\u201d to refer to the various cultural, intellectual, scientific and social resources/systems \n\nthat we inherit, use, experience, interact with, change, and pass on to future generations.  \n\nCommons in the cultural environment thus refers to information commons, science commons, \n\ncultural commons, data commons, and other types of intellectual resource commons \n\n(Frischmann, 2012: 253-314; Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, 2010a; Frischmann, 2007).  \n\nAs shorthand, I and others sometimes refer to these as knowledge commons (Hess and Ostrom, \n\n2005).  There are good reasons for casting a wide net and grouping information, science, \n\nknowledge, culture, data, and so on together.  For brevity, I may refer to one member or another, \n\nbut the analysis that follows applies to all. \n\nIt turns out that intellectual resources have their own \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d-type allegory.  It \n\nis usually invokes the \u201cfree rider\u201d as the selfish actor.  Replace Hardin\u2019s pasture with an \n\nintellectual resource\u2014for example, an idea\u2014and consider what happens when the resource is \n\nopenly accessible to all.  Everyone who can profitably make use of the idea will do so, as much \n\nand as often and in whatever manner suits them.  \u201cSo what?\u201d you may ask, \u201cWhere is the tragedy \n\nin that?  There is no depletion and so there is no ruin.\u201d  Ideas are public goods, not common pool \n\nresources; ideas are consumed nonrivalrously; they have infinite capacity and are not congested \n\nor depleted.  Unconstrained consumption does not seem to pose a problem.  However, there is a \n\ncatch.  We posited an existing idea.  The trouble is that, unlike a pasture, ideas are products of \n\nhuman intellect; they must be created and often require investment.  Unconstrained consumption \n\nof intellectual resources presents a risk for potential investors because it may be difficult to \n\nrecover a sufficient return from those who consume the idea.  We might call these consumers \n\n\u201cfree riders\u201d because they are getting a free ride on the idea creator\u2019s investment.\n15\n\n The result of \n\nfree riding is not too much consumption; rather, it is consumption without payment, and that \n\nmight lead to underproduction of the shared resource, that is, the idea. \n\nWhen viewed from a dynamic perspective, tragic underproduction of intellectual resources \n\nappears to be an inevitable social dilemma so long as consumption is unconstrained.  In fact, the \n\nunderlying problem can be modeled to look exactly like Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons \n\n                                                             \n15 There are a number of complications.  First, even if consumers pay something to contribute to the production of \n\nthe public good, they may behave strategically and misrepresent their actual preferences with the objective of letting \nothers bear a greater proportion of the costs (Samuelson, 1954).  This is a variant of the free-riding problem \n\ndiscussed in the text, but it does not correspond to ex post opportunism and is not solved by exclusion via \n\nintellectual property rights (Frischmann, 2012:  265). Second, some consumers (competitors) who obtain access to \n\nthe resource can share it with others at a marginal cost of zero.  Such sharing may fuel competition but undercut \n\ninvestors\u2019 ability to secure a return.     \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nallegory.  At its core, the free rider allegory also illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each \n\nindividual rationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs.  In \n\nthis context, the social costs encompass the risk to investment and resulting underproduction of \n\npublic goods over time.  Again, the model can be easily translated into a classic collective action \n\nproblem.  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the shared \n\nresource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption appears unsustainable.  A solution is needed.  \n\nIn remarkable parallelism, many analysts simply assume the free rider allegory describes a \n\nnormal (rather than exceptional) problem.  Again, a binary solution set naturally follows:  To \n\navoid tragedy, society must turn to production subsidized by government or to intellectual \n\nproperty-enabled markets.  Government subsidization does not involve introducing constraints \n\non consumption.  Instead, the underproduction problem is dealt with head on.  Government \n\ndirects funds to research activities that yield intellectual resources and thus investment risks no \n\nlonger matter.  These intellectual resources can be shared openly and freely.  On the other hand, \n\nintellectual property rights, such as patents and copyrights, lower the costs of exclusion, enable \n\ntransactions, and mitigate the risk to investment posed by free riders. Intellectual property rights \n\nthus enable markets to function more effectively in supplying intellectual resources.  Both \n\napproaches rely on collective action through government but differ substantially in terms of the \n\nmanner in which resource allocation decisions are made.\n16\n\n    \n\nThe free rider allegory, like the tragedy of the commons allegory, has played a powerful role in \n\nshaping the relevant discourse, policy, and law (Lemley, 2005).  It figures prominently in the \n\nclassroom (textbooks), courtroom (legal opinions), and halls of Congress (political debate).  \n\nYet we should focus on reality and be wary of powerful allegories.  Following Ostrom, we \n\nshould ask two foundational sets of questions:  First, how well does the free rider allegory describe \n\nreality?  Is it a useful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals?   \n\nDoes it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis for choosing or \n\ndesigning regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between government subsidization \n\nand intellectual property-enabled markets reflect the full range of options?  Are there alternative \n\ninstitutions and/or means for collective action? \n\nFree riding\u2014the act of freely using resources generated by another person without payment or \n\neven authorization\u2014is normal.  As I (Frischmann, 2012: 161) argued recently: \n\nfree riding is pervasive in society and a feature, rather than a bug, of our economic, \n\ncultural, and social systems. There are innumerable examples of free riding in society, and \n\nthere is little reason to think that such behavior is inefficiently suppressing investment \n\nincentives systematically throughout society.  Rather, idea diffusion and competition, \n\n                                                             \n16 For a discussion of how government and market resource allocation decisions depend on fundamentally different \n\ndemand signals and evaluation, and how these differences impact the cultural environment, see Frischmann (2012: \n\n109-110, 253-314 ).  \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\namong other important social processes, depend significantly on free\u2014unauthorized, \n\nunlicensed, unapproved and often unpaid\u2014riding.  \n\nThe more difficult question is whether free riding that involves intellectual resources \n\nsystematically reduces incentives to invest in such resources.  Does such free riding normally lead \n\nto a social dilemma?  The claim that it does hinges on certain premises about the behavior of \n\ninvestors.  How does free riding impact actual people who invest time, money, effort, or other \n\nresources to produce intellectual resources?  Does the risk of free riding diminish their incentives \n\nto invest?\n17\n\n   \n\nWhether private incentives are in fact inefficiently suppressed by this risk depends on the type of \n\ninvestment, the intellectual resource in question, and the particular context.  Many intellectual \n\nresources plainly are not subject to this particular concern, as evidenced by the fact that people \n\nconsistently generate the resources without being disabled by concerns over misappropriation.  In \n\nmany situations, people make investments because the expected private benefits exceed their fixed \n\ncosts, regardless of whether or not others free ride.  Appropriating benefits through market \n\nexchange of the intellectual resource or some derivative product may not be relevant to the \n\ninvestor.  For example, we engage in many intellectually productive activities because participation \n\nitself provides sufficient private benefits (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, 2010a; Frey, \n\n2008: 35). Participation can be fun, intellectually stimulating, educational, service-oriented, among \n\nother things (Benkler, 2006; Schweik and English, 2012).  Participation may not be effortless or \n\nfree; it may require substantial investment.  Regardless, the private value derived from \n\nparticipation may be sufficient, and external benefits conferred to others that use or consume the \n\noutput (i.e., the intellectual resource) may be irrelevant to incentives to invest.\n18  \n\nSimilarly, in many \n\nsituations, people create, invent, and innovate because the anticipated returns from their own use of \n\nthe results are sufficient to justify the investment.  There is a rich literature on user innovation that \n\ndemonstrates how many significant innovations result from users seeking to solve their own \n\nparticular problems, needs, or curiosities (Von Hippel, 2006; Strandburg, 2009: 871-888). People \n\noften engage in such activities without disabling concern over free riding.  \n\nThere are many other examples, but the point should be clear.  Free riding does not necessarily \n\nreduce incentives to invest and does not inevitably lead to a social dilemma.  Reality is \n\nconsiderably more complex than the free rider allegory suggests, and there is no good reason for \n\nsystematically marginalizing the many situations in which free riding that involves intellectual \n\nresources does not reduce incentives to invest.  Such myopia is inexcusable.  The bottom line is \n\n                                                             \n17 If free riding does diminish incentives to invest, we would still need to investigate how and to what degree.  \n\nAmong other things, reducing free riding via intellectual property rights likely exhibits diminishing returns in terms \n\nof the impact on incentives.  For further discussion, see Frischmann and Lemley (2007). \n18 Even if those benefits could be internalized, such internalization could potentially decrease incentives to invest \n\nand prove quite costly (Pink, 2010: 37; Amabile, 1996: 17; Benkler, 2006: 298; Frischmann and Lemley, 2007). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nthat the allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently complete manner to \n\nqualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing solutions.  Much more is needed. \n\nMy hypothesis is that free riding negatively impacts investment incentives and leads to social \n\ndilemmas in only exceptional circumstances, but frankly, I do not have empirical evidence to test \n\nthis hypothesis (nor does anyone else, to my knowledge).  My hypothesis is based on anecdote and \n\nobservation, as well as a broad conception of the relevant universe of free riding phenomena and \n\ncircumstances (investment opportunities).  Regardless, as noted above, I confidently claim that \n\nfree riding is ubiquitous and often quite beneficial in the sense that it is an important feature of \n\ncompetition and idea diffusion in society, often generating positive externalities as free riders use \n\nideas productively (Frischmann, 2012).  Consequently, we must take care when prescribing \n\nsolutions to solve supposed social dilemmas associated with free riding. \n\nEven in situations where free riding reduces incentives to invest and a social \u201cunderproduction\u201d \n\ndilemma arises,\n19\n\n it turns out that there are many complications that are too easily overlooked.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s substantive lesson applies with equal force.  First, there are no panaceas.  Government \n\nsubsidies and intellectual property rights are prominent means for addressing social dilemmas, \n\nbut both \u201csolutions\u201d are far from perfect; both are incomplete and introduce their own \n\ncomplications, biases, and inefficiencies.\n20\n\n  Second, and more important for purposes of this \n\narticle, there are many alternative solutions that people regularly employ to avoid tragedy.   \n\nCommons in the cultural environment are an important set of alternatives that deserve systematic \n\nstudy (Hess and Ostrom, 2005).  \n\nBefore proceeding, it is important to be clear about what I mean when I refer to commons; the \n\nconcept is remarkably fluid and varies considerably in its usage across different disciplines.  \n\nHere is how I use it:   \n\nCommons is an institutionalized community practice, a form of community management or \n\ngovernance.  It applies to resources, and it involves a group or community of people, but the \n\ncommons itself is not the resources, the community, a place, or a thing. Commons is the \n\ninstitutional arrangement of these elements.  \u201cThe basic characteristic that distinguishes \n\ncommons from noncommons is institutionalized sharing of resources among members of a \n\ncommunity\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, 2010b: 841).  Critically, there is incredible \n\nvariance among commons in terms of the types of resources and communities, and consequently, \n\nin terms of the institutions through which governance is practiced or implemented.  Of course, \n\nthere are various obstacles to sustainable sharing.  The tragedy of the commons allegory \n\nhighlights one, and the free riding allegory highlights another.  In reality, communities can and \n\noften do overcome these and other obstacles through constructed as well as emergent \n\n                                                             \n19 The classic example of a context in which this dilemma arises is the pharmaceuticals industry (Burk and Lemley, \n\n2009.) \n20 There is a rich literature that defies a brief summary.  \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\ncommons.\n21\n\n  And yet, as Ostrom made clear, commons can and often do fail, and thus demand \n\nsystematic study. \n\nCommons in the cultural environment refers to the institutionalized community practice of \n\nsharing information, science, knowledge, data, and other types of intellectual and cultural \n\nresources.  Many communities regularly share such resources and overcome concerns about free \n\nriding and other dilemmas.\n22\n\n  \n\nMost obvious may be research commons, given the importance of sharing and collaboration \n\nnorms within scientific research communities (Reichman and Uhlir, 2003; Merton, 1973).  \n\nReichman and Uhlir (2003) examined scientific data commons, pressures on the \u201csharing ethos\u201d \n\nwithin various scientific communities, and institutional means for reconstructing commons.  \n\nCook-Deegan and Dedeurwaerdere (2006) examined research commons in the life sciences and \n\nmapped out some of the relationships between the structure and function of the resource \n\ncommons and the relevant community.  The National Research Council of the National \n\nAcademies sponsored an international conference in 2009 that explored microbial research \n\ncommons.  Participants examined how upstream microbial research inputs\u2014microbial data, \n\nliterature, and research materials\u2014can be managed as a commons (Uhlir, 2011; Reichman, \n\nDedeurwaerdere and Uhlir, forthcoming).   \n\nMadison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a) discussed the following less obvious examples:  \n\nintellectual property pools, in which owners of patents in a technological domain license their \n\npatents to a common \u201cpool\u201d from which producers of complex products can obtain all of the \n\npermissions needed to make and sell goods that use the patents; open source computer software \n\nprojects, which offer users of open source programs the ability to create and share modifications \n\nto the programs;\n23\n\n Wikipedia, which offers users of this Internet encyclopedia the power to add to \n\nand edit its contents; the wire service for journalism operated by the Associated Press, which \n\nallows individual member media outlets the opportunity to publish work produced by other \n\nmembers; and \u201cjamband\u201d fan communities, which record, share, and comment on musical \n\nperformances of their favorite groups\u2014with the permission of the artists themselves.  We \n\nmentioned additional examples, including medieval guilds, \u201cthe modern research university and \n\n                                                             \n21 The distinction between constructed and emergent commons arose in the exchange we had with Professors Wendy \n\nGordon and Gregg Macey in the Cornell Law Review (Gordon, 2010: 735,n.14; Macey, 2010: 785-780; Madison, \n\nFrischmann and Strandburg, 2010b: 846-847). \n22 Some dilemmas arise from the traditional solutions to the free rider problem.  For example, intellectual property \n\nrights can interfere with productive use of intellectual resources and deter investments in areas where investors \n\nperceive a threat of exclusive rights \u201cblocking\u201d utilization or further development.  I will not explore the various \n\ndilemmas here, but I would like to make clear that commons are sometimes constructed to overcome problems \ncreated by intellectual property rights (e.g., avoiding a so-called anti-commons).  Yet in other contexts, intellectual \n\nproperty rights are critical inputs for creating a commons and facilitating cooperation and joint production (e.g., \n\nopen source software development projects, such as Linux) (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, 2010a). \n23 For a systematic study of open source software projects using the IAD Framework, see Schweik and English \n\n(2012).   \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nthe departmental and disciplinary structures that lie within and above it,\u201d and the Request for \n\nComments (\u201cRFCs\u201d) series that defines the technical protocols of the Internet.  During a \n\nconference hosted at New York University in 2011, scholars presented case studies that ranged \n\nfrom rare disease research consortia to recreational roller derby leagues.   \n\nThere are many different commons in the cultural environment.  Yet we know very little about \n\nthem:  How do such commons work?  Where do they come from, what contributes to their \n\ndurability and effectiveness, and what undermines them?   \n\nIn the past decade, scholars in various disciplines have become interested in studying these types \n\nof commons, and some have begun case studies.  However, their research too often is focused \n\nnarrowly on the specific case or an isolated area, such as academic publishing or open source \n\nsoftware, and fails to investigate the broader institutional questions and to appreciate the need for \n\nsystematic analysis.\n24\n\n  As a result, they tend to consider only a limited number of descriptive \n\nvariables, which makes integration and learning from a body of case studies quite difficult. \n\nGuided by Ostrom\u2019s methodological lesson and building on her IAD framework as well as her \n\npioneering book with Charlotte Hess (Hess and Ostrom, 2005), Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg (2010a) developed a research framework to facilitate systematic study of commons in \n\nthe cultural environment.  The underlying nature and structure of the inquiry as well as the focus \n\non complexity, context, communities, and institutions unites our project with her legacy.  \n\nNonetheless, we needed to adapt and extend the IAD framework to account for significant \n\ndifferences between commons in the natural environment and commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment.  Most obvious, the resources are different, and as a result, the obstacles that must \n\nbe overcome for institutionalized sharing to work are different.  Thus, for example, the \n\ngovernance structures for commons in the cultural environment manage existing resources as \n\nwell as production and integration of new resources.  Another interesting complication is the \n\ncomplex role of legal institutions in delineating intellectual resources, for example, by defining \n\nwhat constitutes the expression in software that might be governed by open source software \n\nlicenses.  Notably, this complication raises resource boundary and corresponding resource \n\nmanagement issues that are less salient for commons in the natural environment. \n\nMadison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a) explored these and other differences extensively, \n\nand explained why the differences call for a series of inquiries specifically tailored to commons \n\nin the cultural environment.  It turns out that the exogenous variables are more intertwined in this \n\ncontext because separating the managed resources from the attributes and rules-in-use of the \n\ncommunity that produces them can be incredibly difficult, if not impossible in some \n                                                             \n24 This is not a critique of those scholars.  The point is that someone carefully studying a particular information \n\ncommons\u2014say, a patent pool\u2014may not appreciate\u2014much less have the tools or incentives to observe, record, and \n\nevaluate\u2014the many descriptive variables concerning the shared resources, community members, institutions, and \n\ncontext that would facilitate comparison with other commons in the cultural environment\u2014say, other intellectual \n\nproperty pools, open source projects, online commons-based peer-production, jambands, and so on.  \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\ncontexts.  Moreover, distinguishing outcomes from resources and community attributes is not \n\nalways strictly possible, since the interactions of the participants in these commons are \n\ninextricably linked with the form and content of the knowledge output, which in turn is itself a \n\nresource for future production.  At this stage, we have identified the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for our framework and divided the \n\ninvestigation of such variables into groups of questions, summarized in the following \n\nabbreviated outline: \n\nI. Background Environment \n\na. What is the background context (legal, cultural, etc.) of this particular commons? \n\nb. What is the \u201cdefault\u201d status of the resources involved in the commons?  Patented?  \n\nCopyright? Open? \n\n \n\nII. Attributes of the Commons \n\na. Resources \n\ni. Identify all resources being pooled and how they are created or obtained \n\nii. Describe the characteristics of the resources, such as whether they are rival \n\nor non-rival, whether they are tangible or intangible, the technologies \n\nneeded to create, obtain, or maintain them, and the technologies and skills \n\nrequired to use them \n\nb. Community Members \n\ni. Identify community members and describe their roles \n\nii. Describe the degree and nature of openness of the community with respect \n\nto each type of community member and the general public \n\nc. Goals and objectives of the commons \n\ni. Identify the goals and objectives of the commons \n\nii. Identify the history and narrative of the commons \n\n \n\nIII. Governance \n\na. What are the governance mechanisms of the commons (e.g., membership rules, \n\nresource contribution or extraction standards and requirements, conflict resolution \n\nmechanisms, sanctions for rule violation) \n\nb. Who are the decision-makers and how are they selected? \n\nc. What are the institutions that govern decision-making? \n\nd. What informal norms govern the commons? \n\ne. How do nonmembers interact with the commons?  What institutions govern those \n\ninteractions? \n\nf. What legal structures (including intellectual property rules, subsidies, contract and \n\nlicensing law, antitrust provisions) govern the functioning of the commons? \n\n \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nIV. Patterns and Outcomes \n\na. What benefits are delivered to members and to others (including innovations and \n\ncreative output, production, sharing, and dissemination of those innovations and \n\noutput to a broader audience, and social interactions that emerge from the \n\ncommons?) \n\nb. What costs and risks are associated with the commons, including, for example, \n\nany negative externalities? \n\n \n\nEssentially, these clusters of issues guide more detailed inquiry.  Case studies across disciplines \n\nand reviews of existing literature that address commons in the cultural environment will help \n\nspecify relevant attributes within each cluster.  We are developing a coding manual for case \n\nstudies, and we expect the framework to evolve further as researchers apply it to specific case \n\nstudies.  This process is currently underway.   \n\nTaking another page from Ostrom\u2019s lesson book, we have begun to build an international and \n\ninterdisciplinary research community.  Many case studies are underway; more are being planned.  \n\nIt may be a while before we have any major scientific findings to report; it may be slow-going, \n\nlaborious, and incremental.  But that is fine because, as Ostrom showed us, good (social) \n\nscientific research often takes time. \n\nConclusion \n\nElinor Ostrom received the Nobel Prize because of her groundbreaking and path-setting research.  \n\nMany people are only starting to realize and understand the import of her theoretical and \n\nempirical contributions to institutional economics.  These contributions will continue to shape \n\nresearch and education in economics, political science, law, and other disciplines concerned with \n\ninstitutions that shape collective action and community governance of shared resources.   \n\nThe two enduring lessons I highlighted in this article are more basic.  They derive from her \n\nscientific approach to research, and her corresponding demand for rigorous, systematic inquiry.  I \n\nam grateful to have learned these lessons, as I believe they provide a basis for continuing her \n\nwork and extending it to other contexts.  Commons in the cultural environment are one example, \n\nbut there are others\u2014e.g., infrastructure commons and privacy commons.  Simple models of \n\nsocial dilemmas, as well as binary thinking about solutions (government versus market), are \n\nlegion. \n\nI am grateful to have known Elinor Ostrom and to have learned all that she taught me.  She is \n\nmissed, but she remains present in the minds and hearts of the many people she influenced, as \n\nher dedication and insights inspire and fuel future work. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n  \n\nAmabile, T.

Frischmann, &quot;Two Enduring Lessons from Elinor Ostrom,&quot; pays homage to Ostrom&#x27;s profound influence on understanding and managing commons\u2014resources shared by a community, whether they be environmental, cultural, or knowledge-based. The article distills two major lessons from Ostrom&#x27;s work:\n\n1. **Embrace Complexity and Context**: Ostrom advocated for recognizing the nuanced realities of managing commons, which often defy simplistic theoretical models. Her work demonstrated that local, community-based management could successfully govern shared resources without the need for heavy-handed governmental or private control, challenging the prevailing &#x27;tragedy of the commons&#x27; narrative.\n\n2. **Systematic, Evolutionary Learning**: Ostrom promoted a methodological approach that spans various disciplines and emphasizes continuous learning and adaptation. This approach involves detailed case studies and the development of frameworks like the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which guides the systematic study of different commons arrangements.\n\nFrischmann discusses how these lessons apply not only to environmental resources but also to knowledge and cultural commons, where issues of access and management resemble those in environmental contexts. The author emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research and the need for a flexible, evolving approach to studying and managing commons, reflecting Ostrom&#x27;s legacy of innovative, applicable research methodologies.\n\nOverall, the article serves as both a tribute to Ostrom&#x27;s enduring influence and a call to apply her insights more broadly across disciplines to better understand and manage shared resources."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "2b651537-5bd1-4693-a5f0-d629eaebb05e", "request_id": "87d4455ae8f24c6d-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "2b651537-5bd1-4693-a5f0-d629eaebb05e", "children": ["aaa234e1-b95c-4856-93c1-3f585af5b1eb"]}, "aaa234e1-b95c-4856-93c1-3f585af5b1eb": {"id": "aaa234e1-b95c-4856-93c1-3f585af5b1eb", "message": {"id": "aaa234e1-b95c-4856-93c1-3f585af5b1eb", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714613873.752856, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["summary, outline, key ideas, relevance to the topic of sustainable resource management?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-1EbX6yKJHWZ8YVg961t80SeT", "size": 322752, "name": "Week 1_Growth and Collapse of a Resource System.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf"}], "request_id": "87d449e50fdf0e6a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "515b72a8-1642-4b3f-8395-1fab9986f43a", "children": ["ca9db370-b577-439e-a513-e26db0b0137b"]}, "ca9db370-b577-439e-a513-e26db0b0137b": {"id": "ca9db370-b577-439e-a513-e26db0b0137b", "message": {"id": "ca9db370-b577-439e-a513-e26db0b0137b", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714613909.182597, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "file-1EbX6yKJHWZ8YVg961t80SeT", "domain": "Week 1_Growth and Collapse of a Resource System.pdf", "text": "\nGrowth and Collapse of a Resource System: an Adaptive Cycle of Change in Public Lands \nGovernance and Forest Management in Alaska  \n\nAuthor(s): Colin M.

Beier 1,2, Amy Lauren Lovecraft 1, and F. Stuart Chapin, III 1\n\nABSTRACT. Large-scale government efforts to develop resources for societal benefit have often\nexperienced cycles of growth and decline that leave behind difficult social and ecological legacies. To\nunderstand the origins and outcomes of these failures of resource governance, scholars have applied the\nframework of the adaptive cycle. In this study, we used the adaptive cycle as a diagnostic approach to trace\nthe drivers and dynamics of forest governance surrounding a boom\u2013bust sequence of industrial forest\nmanagement in one of the largest-scale resource systems in U.S. history: the Tongass National Forest in\nsoutheastern Alaska. Our application of the adaptive cycle combined a historical narrative tracing dynamics\nin political, institutional, and economic subsystems and a longitudinal analysis of an indicator of overall\nsystem behavior (timber harvests). We found that federal policies in concert with global market changes\ndrove transformative change in both forest governance (policy making) and forest management (practices),\nthrough creation and dissolution of subsidized long-term lease contracts. Evidence of the systemic resilience\nprovided by these leases was found in the analysis of industry responses to market volatility before and\nafter Tongass-specific federal reforms. Although the lease contracts stabilized the Tongass system for a\nperiod of time, they fostered a growing degree of rigidity that contributed to a severe industrial collapse\nand the subsequent emergence of complex social traps. Broader lessons from the Tongass suggest that\nlarge-scale changes occurred only when the nested economic and policy cycles were in coherence, and a\nsystemic effort to minimize social and ecological variability ultimately resulted in catastrophic collapse of\ngovernance. This collapse resulted in a pervasive and challenging legacy that prevents Tongass\nreorganization and limits the adaptive capacity of the larger social\u2013ecological system of southeastern\nAlaska. Although this legacy has inhibited system renewal for two decades, recent trends indicate the\nemergence of new opportunities for progress toward sustainable governance of the Tongass National Forest.\n\nKey Words: adaptive cycle; Alaska; forest management; resource governance; rigidity traps; U.S. National\nForests\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGovernment efforts to stimulate the development of\nnatural resources for public benefit often seek to\nimplement a vision at grand scales that, over time,\ncreates a cycle of dependency that undermines the\noriginal social purpose as well as the resource base\nthat was intended to be sustained. In the United\nStates, this has occurred with respect to agriculture\n(Light et al. 1995), forestry (Repetto 1998, Trosper\n2003), fisheries (Francis and Reiger 1995, Pauly et\nal. 2005), water (Ostrom 1990, Lee 1995), and many\nother types of resource systems (Holling and Meffe\n1996). Similar cycles of dependency have emerged\n\nthrough international aid programs to developing\nnations that were intended to create self-sufficiency\nthrough resource development. Although the goals\nof these programs are often socially admirable and\nprovide an economic stimulus to initiate changes\nthat would otherwise lack the resources to emerge\n\u2014i.e., to escape from poverty traps (Carpenter and\nBrock 2008)\u2014they often result in challenging\nsocial traps (Costanza 1987) that can constrain\noptions for future generations. Why have these\ngovernance efforts failed so consistently, and what\nlessons can be learned that would enlighten efforts\nto address new frontiers of resource governance and\npublic welfare in a rapidly changing world?\n\n1University of Alaska-Fairbanks, 2SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\nmailto:cbeier@esf.edu\nmailto:ffall@uaf.edu\nmailto:terry.chapin@uaf.edu\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nIn this article, we analyze the rise, collapse, and\naftermath of one of the largest resource governance\nprograms in the history of the United States:\nindustrial timber production in the Tongass National\nForest (Tongass) of southeastern Alaska. Although\nlarge-scale industrial forestry emerged as a\nmechanism for stimulating social welfare and\neconomic growth, the Tongass has become one of\nthe most controversial issues of public land\nmanagement in the United States (Wilkinson 1997).\nAs such, its story has been framed in several ways:\nas the central theme in the history and purpose of\nthe U.S. Forest Service in Alaska (Rakestraw 1989);\nas an acute example of political influence,\nmismanagement, and corruption resulting in\nenvironmental degradation (Durbin 1999); as a\ncomplex situation governed by entrenched\ninfluences and acrimonious personal relationships,\nas described by a former agency chief (Steen 2004);\nas a local drama of lost jobs and livelihoods due to\n\u201ceconomic vandalism\u201d by environmentalists\n(Soderberg and DuRette 1988); and as a study of\ncumulative regulatory complications and policy\nreforms resulting in conflicted governance and a\n\u201cdeadlock\u201d among institutions and stakeholder\ngroups (Nie 2006).\n\nAlthough each account yields valuable insights,\nthey present an incomplete and often normative\npicture of the Tongass case and its broader\nimplications for the regional social\u2013ecological\nsystem (SES) of southeastern Alaska; and therefore,\nprovide little guidance on how resource systems\nmight be more effectively governed for long-term\nsustainability and greater public benefit. In this\narticle, we present the first analysis that examines\nthe links among policy, institutions, economies, and\necosystems that shaped the governance of the\nTongass during the 20th century. We apply a\nresilience lens and use the framework of the\nadaptive cycle (Holling and Gunderson 2002) as a\ndiagnostic tool to investigate the nested attributes\nof the Tongass system (Ostrom 2007). Building on\na previous group of adaptive-cycle studies of\nmanagement and governance systems (Gunderson\net al. 1995), we (1) developed an adaptive-cycle\nnarrative of the Tongass coupled with a quantitative\nindicator of system behavior (annual timber\nharvests), (2) traced the adaptive cycles of policy,\ninstitutional, and economic subsystems to identify\nsynergistic feedbacks that drove transformative\nchange at larger scales, and (3) compared adaptive-\ncycle interactions among subsystems to identify\nsources of resilience and vulnerability.\n\nObjectives and Key Questions\n\nIn this case study, we apply the adaptive cycle as\nboth a theoretical framework and a diagnostic\nmethod to reveal the dynamics and interactions of\na resource governance and management system\nnested within a larger SES. We chose the adaptive\ncycle because the Tongass boom\u2013bust cycle typified\nthe \u201cpathology of resource management\u201d (Holling\nand Meffe 1996), characterized by a cyclical pattern\nof dynamics that links ecological (resource) and\nsocial (governance) systems in a higher-order\ncoupled system (SES) (Gunderson et al. 1995,\nHolling et al. 2002b). The adaptive cycle explains\nthe dynamics of a system that is initiated\n(organization [\u03b1]), mobilizes and develops (growth\n[r]), attains a stable configuration (conservation\n[K]), changes to a different structure (collapse [\u2126]),\nand begins the process anew (reorganization [\u03b1]).\nOur focus is on the coupled cycles of change in\ngovernance (through policy and leadership),\nresource management (through practices and\nplanning), and private industry (through processing\nand sale of forest products), and their overall\nimpacts on the southeastern Alaska SES. The\nadaptive-cycle framework supports the systematic\nidentification of key interactions and feedbacks\namong system components that drove system\ndynamics, allowing us to address the following\nquestions:\n\n\u25cf What factors (ecological, economic, cultural,\npolitical) had the greatest overall influence\non stability and change in Tongass\ngovernance and management?\n \n\n\u25cf What aspects of Tongass governance (via\npolicy) and forest management (via practice)\nwere especially vulnerable to drivers of\nchange?\n \n\n\u25cf How did the system stabilize itself against\nexternal perturbation?\n \n\n\u25cf What was the source of this resilience and\nhow was it eventually lost? Was collapse\ntriggered by changes in one or many aspects\nof the system?\n \n\n\u25cf What aspects of the Tongass system resulted\nin the social\u2013ecological legacy that currently\ninhibits renewal toward a more sustainable\nsystem of forest governance?\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n \n\u25cf How does this legacy inhibit progress? How\n\ncan this legacy be overcome to facilitate\nsystem renewal and restore adaptive\ncapacity?\n\nA Systems Framework\n\nWe define the \u201cTongass system\u201d as a coupled\nsystem of governance (the set of structures and\nprocesses by which people make decisions and\nshare power) and management (the set of actions\nthat manipulate a system to achieve desired\noutcomes) nested within in the larger SES. We\nrecognize three nested subsystems of the Tongass\nsystem (Fig. 1): the \u201cinstitutional subsystem,\u201d\nincluding the U.S. Forest Service, principally the\nTongass administration; the \u201cpolicy subsystem\u201d\nthat governs Tongass management and land-use\ndecision making; and the \u201ceconomic subsystem\u201d\nthat defines the structure, capacity, and efficiency\nof the regional industry and market value of its\nproducts. Each subsystem may experience adaptive\ncycles of change influenced by internal components\nand drivers of change (e.g., Tongass managers and\ntheir preferences, legislation specific to Tongass\ngovernance, and economic factors pertaining to\nlocal industry) as well as external components and\ndrivers (e.g., national leadership in the Forest\nService, federal legislation, and global timber\nmarkets) (Fig. 1). Our approach is to explain larger-\nscale SES dynamics by describing the subsystem\ndynamics, which are more easily observed and can\ngenerate transformative feedbacks at larger scales\n(Walker et al. 2004).\n\nIn this article, governance concerns the decisions\nmade regarding the policy goals for the Tongass in\nthe context of a broader vision and purpose for the\nregion of southeastern Alaska, specifically its\ncommunities and natural resources. Management is\nthe active implementation of specific practices, such\nas industrial even-aged forestry, to reach these\nobjectives. Governance emerges primarily from the\npolicy subsystem and management emerges\nprimarily from the institutional subsystem, although\nthe two are functionally coupled.\n\nFor this case study, we narrowly define the regional\necosystem with a focus on environmental factors\nthat directly influenced governance and management,\n\nand the processes that controlled ecological\nresponses to management practices. These include\nthe condition of the old-growth forest resource,\nspatial variation in forest productivity, and the\nremote and rugged geography of the region that\nshaped the options available for resource\ndevelopment (Fig. 1). We did not address\nsuccessional dynamics because these primary\nforests were largely unmodified by human actions\nwhen industrial forestry began, and because second-\ngrowth forests did not reach a harvestable age during\nthe short lifespan of industrial forestry in the region.\nHanley et al. (2005) and Beier et al. (2008) address\nthe longer-term ecological implications of clearcut\nharvesting and even-aged management practices in\nthe temperate rainforests of southeastern Alaska.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nUsing this system structure and the adaptive-cycle\nframework, we developed a historical narrative of\nthe Tongass system that traces a complete loop of\nthe adaptive cycle, beginning with the creation of\nthe Tongass National Forest (1908), passage of key\nlegislation fostering industrial development (1947),\nboom years during which timber production peaked\n(1970), collapse of the regional industry (1997), and\nthe contentious stalemate of the present day (2009).\nIn parallel with this narrative, we traced system\ndynamics using annual timber outputs, a\nquantitative variable reflecting an emergent\nproperty of the Tongass system. Based on this\nlongitudinal analysis (Fig. 2) and a historical\ntimeline of key events in Tongass governance and\nmanagement (Appendix 1), we described the\nadaptive cycle of each subsystem, the cross-\nlinkages among adaptive cycles, and events that\ntriggered \u201ctipping points\u201d in the larger SES. In\nsummarizing the narrative, we address our research\nquestions and revisit Holling and Meffe\u2019s (1996)\n\u201cpathology of resource management\u201d concept to\ndraw broader conclusions from the Tongass case.\n\nSYSTEMS NARRATIVE\n\nOrganization Phase [\u03b1] 1908\u20131947\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the foundations\nof the Tongass system emerged during its\norganization [\u03b1] phase\u2014analogous to the \u201cpioneer\u201d\nstage of forest succession, when several interacting\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nFig. 1.

In\nthe Tongass, the arrival of new actors, conditions,\nand drivers of change interacted to dictate the\nstructure, dynamics, and controls over the future\nsystem.\n\nDuring the 19th century, forests in southeastern\nAlaska were harvested only for local use, primarily\nto support fur traders, the salmon industry, and the\n\nGold Rush. In 1908\u2014a decade after the U.S. Forest\nService was established, four decades after Alaska\u2019s\npurchase from Russia, and coincident with public\nrecognition of Alaska\u2019s natural wealth in gold,\nsalmon, and timber\u2014the 6.7 million acre Tongass\nNational Forest was established, and within a year,\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt and U.S. Forest\nService founder Gifford Pinchot expanded the\nTongass by an additional 8.7 million acres to create\nthe largest national forest in the United States.

Longitudinal analysis of annual timber harvest outputs from the Tongass National Forest and\nsubsystem dynamics (see Appendix 2), divided into the four phases of the adaptive cycle: organization,\ngrowth, conservation, and collapse.\n\nits earliest beginnings, Tongass managers were\npioneers of a broad vision to encourage regional\npopulation growth and establish a clear U.S.\npresence in Alaska by developing a strong, self-\nsufficient economy based on timber production\n(Rakestraw 1989, Nie 2006). The roots of the\nTongass approach\u2014to convert old-growth forests\nto \u201cmore manageable\u201d second-growth stands, while\nfueling a forest-products industry based on pulp and\nsawtimber\u2014were evident upon completion of the\nfirst federal inventories. In 1909, Tongass officials\nsuggested that pulp production was the best use of\nold-growth rainforests, that \u201cthe chief need is for a\n\nplanned harvest of the mature timber\u201d (Rakestraw\n1989:23), and recommended revision of federal law\nto allow the sale of National Forest lands for\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, this industrial approach required\nsignificant private investment to establish a\nsufficient economy of scale to make Tongass timber\nprofitable. Despite the pursuit of such investments\nby key figures, including U.S. Forest Service Chief\nWilliam Greeley in the 1920s and Alaska Regional\nForester Frank Heintzleman throughout the 1930s\nand 1940s, these efforts were thwarted by economic\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nconstraints, including poor regional infrastructure,\ndistance from markets, and the Great Depression.\n\nWorld War II and its aftermath provided the catalyst\nto implement industrial forestry in the Tongass,\nbecause American wartime demand for airplane\nlumber exceeded supplies in Oregon and\nWashington, which had been depleted during World\nWar I. To capture this opportunity, Heintzleman\nsought the advice of timber-industry executives in\npresenting his case for what became the Alaska\nSpruce Log Program (ASLP). Created as an agency\nin 1942, ASLP supplied mills in the continental\nUnited States with high-grade Sitka spruce logs\nfrom the Tongass. At the time, Tongass logging\noccurred primarily by hand-felling the best trees in\naccessible sites, such as beach fringes and river\nbottoms. However, the collective opinion of\nTongass managers, many of whom were\nprofessionally trained foresters, was that clearcutting\nwas a far superior method (Rakestraw 1989).\nTaylor\u2019s (1935) Ecology article provided scientific\njustification for the change from high grading to\nclearcutting in the Alaskan rainforest. With this\njustification, Tongass managers shifted the\nsilvicultural prescription to clearcutting and sought\nto demonstrate the economic viability of harvesting\nthe low-grade timber that comprised the majority of\nthe Tongass timber base.\n\nIn the 18 months of ASLP operation, the program\nexported 38.5 million board feet (MBF) of high-\ngrade spruce to continental U.S. mills, and\ntransferred 46 MBF of lower (utility) grade material\nto local Alaska mills. The ASLP-legislated target\nwas 100 MBF/year of high-grade Sitka spruce, with\nno mention of low-grade materials whatsoever.\nAlthough short lived, the wartime program\ndemonstrated the commercial viability of both\nsawtimber and utility-grade materials from the\nTongass. It also forged strong relationships among\nTongass officials, national policy makers, and\ntimber-industry representatives (Rakestraw 1989).\n\nIn summary, the organization [\u03b1] phase consisted\nof a series of events that initiated adaptive cycles\nsimultaneously in the institutional, policy, and\neconomic subsystems. These adaptive cycles in the\nsubsystems defined the future configuration of the\nTongass system and prepared it for transformation\n(Appendix 2). Key actors in these subsystems\nworked together to shape a common vision of\nindustrial forestry in Alaska (i.e., built the horizontal\nlinks among subsystems), which they viewed as\n\nboth the best path to economic growth and self-\nsufficiency and the best practice for using and\nmanaging the region\u2019s abundant forest resources.\n\nGrowth Phase [r] 1947\u20131975\n\nThe passage of the Tongass Timber Act (TTA) in\n1947 was a landmark event in forest governance that\nmoved the Tongass system into the growth [r] phase.\nWith the TTA, Tongass officials applied a federally\nmandated blueprint to mobilize the resources and\nexpertise required to make industrial forestry a\nreality in Alaska\u2014analogous to the rapid biomass\naccumulation and altered competitive balance\namong species in an early successional forest. In the\nTongass, this involved development of a trained\nworkforce and infrastructure; long-term timber\nleases that altered the relationship between forest\nmanagers and forest users; and increased production\nof forest products (Fig. 2). By authorizing long-term\nguaranteed contracts, favorable scaling and pricing\nrules, and several other subsidies, the TTA provided\nthe impetus needed to overcome economic\nthresholds and transform to a new state of industrial\nforestry.\n\nThe provisions of the TTA were framed by\nlegislators, Tongass officials, and timber-industry\nexecutives. The latter two groups of actors had\nnegotiated terms of lease contracts before the\nlegislation\u2019s passage (Rakestraw 1989). Other\ninterests, including other federal agencies with\nstakes in Alaska land management, were summarily\nexcluded from negotiations, and the bill received\nlittle debate in Congress. The preparation and\npassage of the TTA galvanized the close links\namong agency, legislative, and private-industry\nactors (Rakestraw 1989, Nie 2006), forming a\n\u201cpolicy monopoly\u201d (Baumgartner and Jones 1993,\nKingdon 1995, True et al. 1999) of the Tongass\nsystem, which achieved unprecedented measures to\nfoster industrial-scale forestry, including long-term\nleases that guaranteed non-competitive access to\nmillions of acres of publicly owned forest land.\nLease holders were required to operate pulp mills\nin the region and, in return, received low-interest\nloans, a favorable log-scaling system, and refunds\nof road-building costs (Soderberg and DuRette\n1988). Harvest units in leases were planned largely\nby company foresters and then released to lease\nholders on demand (without open bidding) by the\nTongass. The U.S. Forest Service planning process\nat this time was relatively unfettered by legislative\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\ncomplications, public participation, or judicial\ndecisions (Nie 2006). As a result, there was a low\ndegree of transparency and a high degree of internal\ncontrol in the execution of the long-term timber\ncontracts; such traits are characteristic of industries\noperating on public resources through a policy\nmonopoly (Repetto 1988).\n\nEarly in this period, the Tongass system mobilized\nrapidly in the direction prescribed and supported by\nits policy monopoly. Immediately after the TTA,\nthe U.S. Forest Service and the newly formed\nKetchikan Pulp Company (KPC) agreed to\npreliminary terms of a lease contract. The KPC\ncontract was finalized in 1951 and guaranteed over\n8.5 billion board feet of timber over 50 years, subject\nto 5-year reviews by the U.S. Forest Service; the\nKPC contract set aside nearly one-fifth of the\nTongass for exclusive bidding rights (Soderberg and\nDuRette 1988). In 1953, the Japanese-owned\nAlaska Pulp Development Co. was incorporated in\nthe United States and signed a 50-year, 4.5 billion\nboard foot contract requiring construction of a large\nsawmill and pulp mill in Sitka. By 1959, the Alaska\nPulp Company (APC) was in operation in Sitka.\nAnother long-term contract with the Pacific\nNorthwest Timber Co. was finalized with the\nconstruction of large sawmill in Wrangell. Other\nlease offerings included large tracts in some of the\nmost biologically rich areas of the Tongass, e.g.,\none lease included nearly 90% of productive forests\non Admiralty Island, which today exists as a\nkeystone reserve of regional biodiversity (Beier\n2008).\n\nWithin 5 years of passage of the TTA, roughly 14\nbillion board feet of Tongass timber was under\ncontract to lease holders. In 1953, Regional Forester\nHeintzleman retired from the U.S. Forest Service\nand was appointed Territorial Governor of Alaska,\nwhere he continued vigorous pursuit of\nprogressively larger timber leases in the region\n(Rakestraw 1989). The three existing lease contracts\nproduced over 90% of Tongass timber harvested\nduring the 1960s and 1970s. In the early 1970s, the\nsystem\u2019s growth phase reached several milestones:\nmaximum annual harvest from the Tongass (560\nMBF), maximum Alaskan share of U.S. timber\nexports to Japan (42%), and the small town of\nKetchikan became the third-largest producer of\ncellulose pulp in the world.\n\nDuring this period, a series of legislative and judicial\ndecisions (Appendix 3), beginning in 1960 with the\n\nMultiple Use Sustained Yield Act (MUSYA), began\nto erode the discretional authority of the U.S. Forest\nService (LeMaster 1984). These \u201cperturbations\u201d to\nthe Tongass policy subsystem were largely driven\nby the growing influence of the U.S. environmental\nmovement. With the exception of one major lawsuit\n(Sierra Club v Hardin), these events were not\nspecific to the Tongass and did not significantly\ninfluence system behavior, based on harvest trends\n(Fig. 2). However, these events did begin to\nchallenge the Tongass policy monopoly and its\ncontrol over forest governance by establishing new\nrules and venues for debate and decision making.\nFor this reason, these events provide a window into\nhow the Tongass system was stabilized, or\nconserved, in the face of change\u2014these interactions\nare the focus of the following section.\n\nIn summary, during the growth [r] phase, Tongass\ntimber outputs grew rapidly and stabilized at a\nharvest level roughly 20 times greater than during\nthe organization [\u03b1] phase (Fig. 2). This\ntransformation in the Tongass system resulted from\na solidification of the links among the institutional,\npolicy, and economic subsystems, creating a rigid\nsystem that had minimal transparency or links to\nother processes such as the environmental lobby or\nsmall-scale logging companies that had interests in\nTongass governance. The mills in Ketchikan, Sitka,\nand Wrangell prospered, and the regional industry\nsupported an estimated 3500 local jobs and\nnumerous local schools, which benefited from\ndirect transfers of timber-based revenues (Allen et\nal. 1998). At the beginning of the [r] phase,\nlegislation created positive feedbacks in the policy\nsubsystem that triggered implementation of the\nTongass system; and toward its conclusion,\nlegislation created negative feedbacks that\nincreased the rigidity of internal links among all\nsubsystems of the Tongass. During this period, the\neconomic subsystem was driven largely by positive\nfeedbacks fostering continued growth in forest-\nproducts manufacturing (Appendix 2), which\npeaked in 1970. Because of the tight links among\nthe three subsystems, the positive feedbacks in the\npolicy and economic subsystems drove the growth\nof the Tongass system.\n\nConservation phase [K] 1975\u20131990\n\nBefore 1975, the Tongass system and its policy\nmonopoly remained largely unfettered by changes\nin public opinion and federal policy associated with\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nthe environmental movement. In 1975, for the first\ntime, a federal court ruled against the practice of\nclearcut logging in the Tongass. This event moved\nthe Tongass system into a conservation [K] phase\n\u2014a state analogous to the \u201cclimax\u201d stage of a mature\nforest when the dominant canopy trees strongly\ninfluence endogenous conditions and the system is\nlargely resilient to disturbance (Holling and\nGunderson 2002). During this phase, the Tongass\nsystem faced external, converging drivers of change\nin public policy (Nie 2006), institutional\ngovernance (LeMaster 1984), and global markets\n(Crone 2004). The interactions of these drivers with\ncomponents of the Tongass system revealed the\nmechanisms providing stability and resilience, as\nwell as incipient vulnerabilities. The conservation\nphase is aptly named in two senses: it was a period\nof growing influence of environmental (conservation)\nadvocates in Tongass governance; and it was a\nperiod in which the Tongass system was stabilized\n(or conserved) against directional and mostly\nexternal drivers of change. The latter meaning\u2014\nmaintenance of the system status quo\u2014is our focus.\n\nIn lawsuits against the U.S. Forest Service in\nMontana and West Virginia, federal courts ruled\nthat clearcutting in National Forests was in violation\nof the intent and language of the Organic Act of\n1898 (Nie 2006). Immediately afterward,\nenvironmentalists filed suit (Zieske v Butz) to\nprevent further Tongass clearcut logging by KPC\nand won an initial victory. This ruling was the first\ndirect challenge to the legality of an existing\nTongass long-term contract. By contrast, the Sierra\nClub v. Hardin action (1965\u20131971) sought to\nprevent a pending contract by opposing its\nassociated pulp mill on environmental grounds. The\nZieske v Butz decision set a powerful, albeit brief\nprecedent against industrial-scale logging in the\nTongass; if broadly applied, the decision would\nhave forced the U.S. Forest Service to default on the\ntimber contracts upon which the regional industry\ndepended. The Tongass decision, and those that\npreceded it, led to a stalemate that required\nimmediate intervention by the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe National Forest Management Act (NFMA),\ndrafted largely to allow National Forest timber\noperations to resume, prescribed broad reforms to\nthe U.S. Forest Service planning process. Adding\nfurther to complications created by earlier\nlegislation, the NFMA required each National\nForest to complete a comprehensive management\nplan using an interdisciplinary approach with\ngreater opportunities for public participation.\n\nMoreover, the NFMA strongly reiterated the\nmultiple-use concept (of MUSYA), but neither\nprovided specific guidelines for its application, nor\nreduced the agency\u2019s discretion in achieving the\nmultiple-use objective. As a result, legislators left\nNFMA\u2019s intent open to debate and effectively\ntransferred the venue of that debate to federal courts,\nin turn fostering the legal \u201cobstructionism\u201d that has\nbecome the principal source of paralysis in U.S.\nForest Service planning (Nie 2006). With growing\nopposition to the long-term leases, the Tongass\nplanning process became one of the most\ncontentious in the nation (Malmsheimer et al. 2004).\n\nTongass governance was further complicated by the\nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act\n(ANILCA) of 1981, which reserved nearly one-\nthird of Tongass lands as protected areas. As a result,\nthe ANILCA effectively reduced the operable\nTongass timber base (productive forest land), also\nby roughly one-third (Beier 2008). The Tongass was\none of the most contentious issues in the ANILCA\ndebate (Cahn 1982) because of vehement opposition\nby the Tongass policy monopoly and local\nstakeholder groups who viewed land withdrawals\nas a direct threat to regional economic welfare\n(Nelson 2004). In exchange for difficult\ncompromises on wilderness designation in the\nTongass, a number of provisions supporting the\nregional industry and assuring subsidies to lease\nholders were included in the ANILCA (Beier 2008).\nThe most significant Tongass-related provision\nnegotiated into the bill by Senator Ted Stevens\nauthorized at least $40 million annually to support\nthe timber-sale program. With this guaranteed\nfunding, the Tongass was instructed to supply the\nregional industry 4.5 billion board feet of timber\nvolume per decade. This provision had the effect of\nformally redefining the allowable (maximum) sale\nquantity prescribed in the 1979 Forest Plan as the\ntarget harvest quantity. Tongass managers\ninterpreted this as a mandate to harvest 450 MBF\neach year regardless of market demand (Nie 2006),\nin turn creating an additional source of rigidity in\nthe institutional subsystem of the Tongass. The\nfunding also supported low-interest loans for lease\nholders, research for improvement of forest yields\nand processing efficiency, and new markets for\nTongass forest products. The ANILCA also\nexempted the Tongass from federal guidelines\nrequiring removal of non-commercial-grade forests\nfrom the operable timber base. In total, these\nprovisions had the effect of reaffirming timber\nproduction as the \u201cbest use\u201d of all non-reserved\nTongass lands.\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nDuring this period, increased volatility in timber\nexport markets, and the industry response to these\nfluctuations, signaled the shift of the economic\nsubsystem into the [K] phase (Appendix 2). In 1979,\nexport markets for Tongass pulp products\nexperienced a dramatic decline that lasted\nthroughout much of the 1980s, due mostly to shifts\nin global demand and increased competition\n(Rakestraw 1989). Tongass harvests declined\nclosely in parallel with market fluctuations (Fig. 2),\nsuggesting that much of the regional industry was\noperating at or near the margin, despite the\nconsiderable subsidies received by the long-term\nlease holders. Meanwhile, increased competition\nand the growing disparity between Alaskan mills\nand their competitors, in terms of technology and\nefficiency, posed major challenges to the regional\nindustry (Crone 2004).\n\nIn summary, during the conservation [K] phase, the\nTongass system proved resilient to multiple\nperturbations from legal challenges and new\nlegislation that had either a national focus (NFMA,\nEndangered Species Act (ESA), National\nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA)) or an Alaska-\nwide focus (ANILCA), as well as market\nfluctuations driven by global demand and increased\ncompetition. Although federal environmental\nlegislation and subsequent judicial decisions began\nto erode the primacy of U.S. Forest Service\ndiscretion in governance, the Tongass policy\nmonopoly was able to minimize the impact of these\nchanges; and in response to its most direct threat (to\ndate), was able to safeguard its authority in the\nANILCA debate (Beier 2008). Hence the policy\nsubsystem was in a [K] phase because the policy\nmonopoly remained resilient in the face of rapidly\nstrengthening and expanding drivers of change\n(Appendix 2). Resilience in the policy subsystem\nprevented these perturbations from strongly\ndestabilizing either the institutional or the economic\nsubsystems, thus stabilizing the entire Tongass\nsystem. However, this stability arose entirely\nthrough the addition of rigidity to existing links\namong subsystems, setting the stage for collapse of\nthe entire Tongass system, as we describe below.\n\nCollapse Phase [\u2126] 1990\u20132008\n\nPassage of the Tongass Timber Reform Act (TTRA)\ninitiated the collapse [\u2126] phase of Tongass\nmanagement\u2014analogous to the release stage\ntypically initiated by a stand-replacing event, such\n\nas a fire or disease outbreak, that exceeds the\nresilience of the mature forest. Likewise, the\n\u201cmature\u201d Tongass system became rigid and\nmaladaptive in response to a confluence of events\nthat fostered simultaneous collapse dynamics in the\npolicy and economic subsystems. Within 5 years of\nthe passage of the TTRA, Tongass timber\nproduction declined by roughly 85% and stabilized\nat an output level equivalent to the pre-industrial\nproduction level (Fig. 1).\n\nIn a 1983 lawsuit, Reid Bros. Logging v Ketchikan\nPulp Co., the plaintiffs claimed that KPC unfairly\nforced smaller operators out of the industry. The\ncourt ruled that KPC had engaged in illegal\nconspiracy and anti-competitive practices, and in\nsubsequent lawsuits, ruled that KPC and APC had\ncolluded to marginalize the smaller timber\ncompanies (Durbin 1999). These rulings did not\nimmediately affect the long-term leases, but\ncertainly contributed to the legislative rebuke of the\nlease structures codified several years later in the\nTTRA (Nie 2006).\n\nIn a strong rebuke of the legitimacy of the long-term\nleases, the TTRA essentially dismantled the\nTongass policy monopoly, which in turn drove the\npolicy subsystem to collapse. First and foremost,\nthe TTRA repealed the minimum annual harvest\nmandate and associated subsidies that were won by\nTongass advocates in the ANILCA debate and\ninstead instructed managers to \u201cprovide for the\nmultiple use and sustained yield of all renewable\nforest resources,\u201d to \u201cseek to provide a supply of\ntimber\u201d according to market demand, and to\n\u201cpromote fair competition\u201d in the regional industry\n[emphasis added]. The law modified the lease\ncontracts by eliminating bidding preferences,\npurchaser road credits, and pricing advantages\ngiven to lease holders. The TTRA also created\nTongass-wide stream buffers to protect local\nfisheries, which removed some of most productive\n(and valuable) remaining Tongass stands from\npotential harvest (Nie 2006). As interpreted by the\n9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the TTRA\ninstructed that Tongass management was to be\nguided by \u201cnot an inflexible harvest level, but a\nbalancing of the market, the law, and other uses,\nincluding preservation\u201d [emphasis added].\n\nIn the economic subsystem, investors and industry\nexecutives viewed the TTRA as a sign that Tongass-\nbased operations would no longer be predictable or\nprofitable (Nie 2006). A number of other indicators,\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nmostly related to market volatility and aging mill\ninfrastructure, also pointed to industry collapse.\nFirst, the APC contract depended on the sustained\nlevels of high Japanese demand for Alaskan\nsawtimber and cellulose pulp, even after post-war\nreconstruction had been completed. By 1985, due\nto a decline in pulp markets, the Tongass share of\nU.S. timber exports to Japan dropped to its lowest\npoint (6%) since APC began operations in Sitka.\nSecond, by the 1980s, most mill facilities in Alaska\nlagged far behind regional and global competitors\nin terms of efficiency and technology. Yet because\nof the age and capital amortization of most mills in\nthe region, decisions about both production levels\nand mill improvements were largely driven by\nshort-term profitability. Coupled with the high\noperating costs in southeastern Alaska, poor\nmarkets triggered sporadic mill closures and re-\nopenings throughout the 1980s and 1990s (Morse\n2000). Between 1984 and 1987, all of the major\nmills in the region\u2014except those owned by KPC\nand APC\u2014closed for at least a 3-year period, and\ntwo of these mills never reopened (Brackley et al.\n2006). This volatile economic environment, in\nconcert with growing political uncertainty, strongly\ndiscouraged further investment in mill operations\nor improvements.\n\nSoon after the TTRA, Alaskan export markets\nexperienced another cyclical downturn similar to\nthat of the 1980s, although of lesser magnitude in\nterms of price deflation (Crone 2004). This time,\nhowever, lease holders decided to close the major\npulp mills in Sitka (in 1994) and Ketchikan (in\n1997). These mill closures violated the terms of the\nlease contracts, which were subsequently\nterminated by the U.S. Forest Service, prompting a\nround of lawsuits by the lease holders; APC lost\ntheir case, and KPC settled for $140 million.\n\nIn the institutional subsystem, the TTRA ushered in\nan era in which Tongass decision making effectively\nshifted to judicial and political venues outside of the\nagency (Nie 2006). A recent study estimated that\nfrom 1997\u20132003, 88% of NEPA-required\nenvironmental impact statement (EIS) decisions\nwere appealed on the Tongass; of these, nearly all\nconcerned timber sales, road permits, and other\nrelated development activities (U.S. Department of\nAgriculture (USDA) Forest Service 2004). The\naccumulation of several decades of environmental\npolicies and planning statutes concerning the U.S.\nForest Service fostered an environment where \u201cthe\nthreat of judicial review, injunction, remand, and\n\nthe like cast a very long shadow on agency decision\nmaking\u201d (Nie 2006). Two events immediately\nfollowing the TTRA created further uncertainty in\nthe Tongass administration: first, a 1991\nmoratorium on National Forest logging in Oregon\nand Washington was enacted in response to the\nnorthern spotted-owl (Strix occidentalis caurina)\ncontroversy and the ESA (Trosper 2003); second,\nthe election of President Clinton (1992) caused\nmajor political shifts in the U.S. Forest Service,\nsymbolized most clearly by the appointment of\nwildlife biologist Jack Ward Thomas as agency\nchief, the first non-forester in agency history to hold\nthat position (Steen 2004).\n\nDuring this turbulent period, the Forest Service was\nin the process of revising the 1979 Tongass Forest\nPlan, as required by NFMA. Because the TTRA was\nenacted 3 years into the Forest Plan revision process,\nthe law required Tongass officials to \u201cgo back to the\ndrawing board,\u201d which eventually resulted in a\ndecade-long, $13 million planning effort (Nie\n2006). In many ways, this planning process and its\npriorities suggested a new direction for Tongass\ngovernance, as the new Forest Plan and the process\nof its development were starkly different from its\npredecessor. The 1997 Tongass Land Management\nPlan (TLMP) incorporated the principles of\necosystem management, species conservation, and\nold-growth forest reserves, and designated roughly\n36% of the Tongass in a land-use category of\n\u201cNatural Setting,\u201d where minimal timber harvesting\nand road construction is allowed. In doing so, the\n1997 TLMP reduced the operable Tongass timber\nbase and maximum allowable annual sale quantity\nby nearly half. Including the reserves created by the\nANILCA in 1980, the 1997 TLMP left 28% of the\nTongass land base for timber production. By\ncontrast, roughly 95% of productive forest lands\nwere scheduled for harvest when Congress passed\nthe Tongass Timber Act in 1947. Clearly, the\nTongass had reorganized its institutional priorities,\nas forced primarily by \u201cnew\u201d factors, namely\ndecades of policy reforms and political shifts related\nto public opinion against clearcutting (Bliss 2000).\n\nDespite new factors shaping the Tongass system,\nthis period has been consistently influenced by\npowerful remnants of the erstwhile policy\nmonopoly. Although the Alaska congressional\ndelegation unsuccessfully obstructed the passage of\nthe TTRA and strongly opposed the conservation\ndirectives of the 1997 TLMP, they effectively used\nlegislative committee positions and seniority to\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nexert their influence through budget \u201criders\u201d\u2014\nadditions to bills unrelated to their intent\u2014and other\ninstruments, some of which have been adversarial\nin nature. For example, in exchange for allowing\nthe TLMP planning process to proceed with\nadditional conservation areas and reduced emphasis\non timber operations, Senator Stevens appropriated\n$110 million of \u201cTongass Disaster Relief Funds\u201d\nfrom the federal budget, yielding individual payouts\nranging from $30 000 to $100 000 per lost job\n(Whitney 1996). Senator Stevens and the Alaska\ndelegation also used, with varying levels of success,\nnumerous riders to influence Tongass governance,\nincluding: a separate annual payment of\napproximately $30 million in \u201crelief funds\u201d to the\ncity of Ketchikan; a 1995 provision that would have\nstrictly limited the discretion of Tongass managers\nto set new logging limits and conduct NEPA-\nrequired environmental research; and a 1998\nprovision that would have instructed the Tongass to\nprepare exactly 253 MBF for sale the following\nyear. This last provision, which was removed from\nthe budget before passage, outlined specific legal\nand fiscal consequences if Tongass managers did\nnot fully comply. As of 2008, these \u201cappropriation\npolitics\u201d have remained the dominant way the\nTongass is governed by the Congress (Nie 2006).\n\nIn summary, the collapse [\u2126] phase was initiated by\ndramatic and Tongass-focused policy changes\n(TTRA) that effectively dismantled the Tongass\npolicy monopoly and thus irreversibly transformed\nthe policy subsystem. Closure of the pulp mills in\nSitka and Ketchikan, triggered largely by fiscal\nconcerns arising from both loss of lease subsidies\nand market volatility, forced action in the\ninstitutional subsystem to terminate the long-term\nlease contracts. As the glue that held the entire\ngovernance system together\u2014i.e., coupling the\ninstitutional, economic, and policy subsytems of the\nTongass into a rigid configuration\u2014the dissolution\nof lease contracts had catastrophic consequences.\nRigidity in the system, created initially to promote\ngrowth but increased over time as a mechanism to\nresist external changes, precluded any efforts to\nadapt or transform. Since collapse, Tongass\ngovernance has been largely incapable of\nreorganization.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe preceding narrative suggests the importance of\nchanges in federal policy and larger-scale economic\nfactors as the key drivers of adaptive-cycle\ndynamics in Tongass governance. Policy mobilized\nmuch of the initial growth, provided much of the\nstability during the conservation phase, and served\nto destabilize\u2014at first incrementally and then rather\nsuddenly\u2014the industrial forestry regime of the\nTongass. The changing economic context dictated\nthe timing of policy implementation (growth phase)\nand eroded the resilience of the Tongass system\nduring its collapse. We found that, in both the\ninitiation and collapse of the Tongass system,\ntransformative change occurred only when the\nadaptive cycles of two or more subsystems were in\ncoherence\u2014in other words, when some synergy\nexisted in economic, political, and institutional\ncomponents. Our observation that policy drivers\nresulted in brief, dramatic changes (or \u201clurches\u201d)\ninterspersed with long periods of relative stability,\nis consistent with punctuated equilibrium theories\nof policy making (True et al. 1999). As observed in\nother forest-governance systems (Baskerville\n1995), this suggests that non-linear shifts in policy\ncan drive similar dynamics in larger-scale\ngovernance systems involving ecological, economic,\nand institutional components and controls (Holling\net al. 2002b).\n\nWe can trace the importance of the policy monopoly\nthroughout the Tongass adaptive cycle. In the \u201cfore-\nloop\u201d of growth [r] and conservation [K], the policy\nmonopoly fostered change by creating the long-term\nleases and subsequently provided stability to the\nsystem against external perturbations. Growth was\nfostered by policies that created incentives for local\ninvestment to capture the market opportunities\nemerging from post-World War II reconstruction.\nThese horizontal links between the policy and\neconomic subsystems fostered resilience. Stability\nwas also fostered in the institutional subsystem by\nmaintaining exclusive control over venues of\ndecision making and planning, by ensuring lease\nholder subsidies, and by influencing policy making\nat various scales as it pertained to the Tongass.\nOverall, by maintaining the legitimacy of the long-\nterm leases, the policy monopoly conserved the\nentire system\u2019s stability. Over time, however, this\nmonopoly was eroded as the feedbacks of\nenvironmental and regulatory reforms accumulated\nin both the institutional and policy subsystems.\nThese reforms reflected broader changes in public\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nopinion (Bliss 2000) associated with the\nenvironmental movement at scales larger than the\nTongass and were specifically provoked by\nmanagement outcomes and legal actions in other\nNational Forests (Trosper 2003). As these cross-\nscale feedbacks (panarchy) drove collapse in the\npolicy subsystem, the Tongass system lost its\nresilience to market-oriented perturbations and\nexperienced a precipitous decline in output\u2014\ninitiating dynamics of collapse [\u2126] and providing\nopportunities for potential reorganization [\u03b1] that\nhave not yet been realized.\n\nEvidence of this policy-supported resilience can be\nfound by comparing system dynamics (annual\nharvest outputs) during two periods of price\ndepression in Alaskan export markets: (1) during\nthe 1980s while the long-term lease subsidies were\nin place and (2) during the 1990s after the TTRA\neliminated lease subsidies. During the first severe\nprice depression faced by the Tongass-based\nindustry, although the long-term leases and\nsubsidies were considered safe, market volatility\nresulted in similar fluctuations in harvest output.\nWhen market prices recovered and stabilized,\nharvests rebounded to previous levels (Fig. 2). In\nother words, when the policy subsystem was\nresilient, it afforded resilience to the economic\nsubsystem by assuring investor confidence in the\nlong-term leases and future profit potential (Nie\n2006). In contrast, when a second, but less severe,\nmarket downturn occurred in the early 1990s (Crone\n2004), the entire system collapsed, triggered by\nclosure of the regional pulp mills and the subsequent\ntermination of both lease contracts. We suggest the\nprincipal difference was the state of the policy\nsubsystem, which had entered a collapse [\u2126] phase\n(upon passage of the TTRA) before the second\nmarket downturn. Therefore, by reducing investor\nconfidence in a stable timber supply from the\nTongass (Nie 2006) in addition to eliminating\nsubsidies, the TTRA destabilized the economic\nsubsystem, making it much less resilient to market\nvolatility.\n\nLastly, our case study illustrated the importance of\nscale mismatches and cross-scale interactions in the\nSES. Because of a relatively short observation\nperiod, the apparent lack of negative impacts of\neven-aged management practices in Alaska led\nmanagers to falsely conclude that ecological\nresponses to logging practices were benign, if not\nfavorable. In fact, the short-term feedbacks at the\nlocal scale were almost entirely positive, both in\n\nterms of societal benefits and reinforcing scientific\nassumptions about forest responses to clearcutting\n(Rakestraw 1989). Today, however, recognition of\nthe lagged ecological costs of forest harvest in\nAlaska (Beier et al. 2008) has prompted urgent\nefforts to sustain subsistence and commercial\nresources while managing second-growth forests.\nOf course, this mismatch in temporal scales (i.e.,\necological processes vs. human observation) was\napparent in the longer-term outcomes from similar\nforest management in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.\nEnvironmental advocates who perceived the\ndegradation of these National Forests resulting from\nsimilar industrial practices (Trosper 2003) feared a\nsimilar fate for the Tongass in Alaska (Durbin\n1999). Their dramatic influence on National Forest\ngovernance in the late 20th century acted across\nscales to end industrial logging in the Tongass. This\nsuggests that ecological feedbacks from other\nregions, through processes fostered by a democratic\nsociety, act to drive transformative change in\ngovernance.\n\nHolling\u2019s Pathology and the Tongass Rigidity\nTrap\n\nIn many ways the Tongass case epitomizes the\n&quot;pathology of resource management&quot; described by\nHolling et al. (2002a: 6):\n\nNew policies and development usually\nsucceed initially, but they lead to agencies\nthat gradually become rigid and myopic,\neconomic sectors that become slavishly\ndependent...and a public that loses trust in\ngovernance.\n\nFor the Tongass, an initial period of rapid growth\ngave way to a period in which Holling&#x27;s pathology\nbecame obvious. Forest managers became bound to\nthe rigid requirements of the long-term contracts\nregardless of dramatic changes in their political and\neconomic landscape. As this landscape shifted,\nTongass governance remained rigidly focused on\nexecuting lease contracts and sustaining the regional\nindustry. The fate of the industry and its dependent\ncommunities hinged on lease holder subsidies that\nsought to ensure the local manufacture of forest\nproducts would continue in conjunction with\nfavorable export markets. In addition to\nemployment and infrastructure development\nprovided by the forest-products economy, many\nremote southeastern Alaska communities relied\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nheavily on U.S. Forest Service timber receipts for\npublic-school funding (Allen et al. 1998). Not\nunique to the Tongass, this \u201cslavish dependence\u201d of\nagency, economy, and community has been a\ncharacteristic outcome of U.S. National Forest\ntimber programs (Repetto 1988), especially in the\nPacific Northwest (Trosper 2003).\n\nThe Tongass adaptive cycle illustrates how\n\u201ccommand-and-control\u201d management (Holling and\nMeffe 1996)\u2014the attempt to control system\nvariability, and the assumption that outcomes would\nbe static and predictable\u2014may emerge in the\norganizing principles of a resource system, be\nsuccessful for a period of time, but eventually yield\nto catastrophic failure. Overall, this approach\ncreated intrinsic vulnerabilities that were largely\nmasked during the boom years of Tongass timber,\nbut have left a multifaceted legacy that includes the\ncurrent political stalemate (Nie 2006), a less\ncompetitive regional industry (Crone 2004,\nBrackley et al. 2006), and concerns about capacity\nof managed forest watersheds to sustain local\nproduction of resources\u2014including timber\u2014\nessential for subsistence and commercial economies\n(Beier et al. 2008). Each of these outcomes points\nto the existence of \u201crigidity traps\u201d preventing\nreorganization of the Tongass system to address\nnew challenges and opportunities (Carpenter and\nBrock 2008).\n\nFirst and foremost, the loss of trust in governance\nis probably the only shared perspective among the\nenvironmental advocates, industry representatives,\nlegislators, and local residents who engage in\ncontinuous conflict over the Tongass. Although the\nTongass situation is not unique in the National\nForest system, its importance as an icon of the global\nenvironmental movement (Durbin 1999) has raised\nthe stakes considerably. In the current state, Tongass\nmanagers are pitted between environmental\nadvocacy groups (via litigation and appeals) and\npro-timber legislators and executive officials (via\nbudgets and national leadership). This situation acts\nto maintain day-to-day Tongass decision making in\na highly stable but inflexible state that constrains\nmanagers from responding adaptively to changing\nconditions and, ultimately, from finding a\nsustainable direction for the future governance of\nthe Tongass. As long as the dominant venues of\nstakeholder input in Tongass decision making are\nadversarial\u2014i.e., through appeals and litigation\u2014\nthe institutional subsystem will remain \u201ctrapped\u201d in\nthe collapse [\u2126] phase.\n\nLikewise, the Tongass timber leases left a difficult\nlegacy for the economic subsystem, in terms of the\nlocal capacity to profitably manufacture forest\nproducts. Because the lease contracts were linked\nwith the pulp mills, when the mills closed and the\nleases were terminated, the industry lost its capacity\nto process the low-grade materials that comprise\nmuch of the Tongass timber base. Despite\nimproving markets in recent years, local industry\nproduction has remained near historical lows,\nindicating that the industry has lost much of the\nflexibility that was apparent during the market\ndownturns of the 1980s (Brackley et al. 2006). One\nexplanation for this outcome is the decline of local\nmill infrastructure; in terms of technology and\nefficiency, most regional mills have remained\nlargely unimproved since the 1980s (if not earlier).\nIndustry analysts suggest that improvements in local\nmills are needed to compete in global markets\n(Crone 2004). Yet with a high degree of uncertainty\nthat future timber sales will survive appeals and\nlitigation (U.S. Forest Service 2004), any\nsubstantial investments in local mills is unlikely in\nthe near term (Nie 2006). This uncertainty, in\nconcert with structural changes in the regional\nindustry, maintains the economic subsystem in a\nrigidity trap that will be difficult to escape.\n\nLastly, the yielding of Forest Service control over\nharvesting schedules to timber companies led to the\n\u201clandscape-scale high grading\u201d of the Tongass, in\nwhich lease holders targeted the most productive\nforests to maximize profits (Durbin 1999).\nAlthough precise data are not available, based on\nbiophysical models and historical harvest maps, it\nis estimated that less than one-third of the most\nproductive \u201cbig-tree\u201d rainforests in the entire\nTongass remain unharvested (C. Beier, unpublished\ndata). Nearly all of these remaining big-tree forests\nare either protected by federal legislation (such as\nthe ANILCA) or reserved from logging in the old-\ngrowth networks of the 1997 Forest Plan. As a result,\nthe most productive stands in the current timber base\nof the Tongass are many decades from being\nharvestable, which further constrains opportunities\nfor reorganization.\n\nEscaping the Legacy of Social Traps\n\nRecent developments suggest a potential pathway\nout of these rigidity traps and reorganization toward\nmore sustainable governance of the Tongass.

These offers involve up to 50 000\nboard feet per sale, which may equate to as few as\n10 individual trees; in contrast, standard clearcut\nharvest units typically range into several millions\nof board feet across hundreds of acres. With\nmicrosales, trees are harvested using selection\nlogging and aerial yarding methods that have\nminimal ecological impact compared with the large\nclearcut harvests of the past five decades. Tongass\nmicrosales also meet local demand and provide\nopportunities for value-added manufacturing, and\nperhaps most importantly, all sales have involved\ncompetitive bidding and none have been challenged\nin court. Further advancements in cooperation and\nbuilding trust among stakeholders are also evident.\nIn 2006, the Tongass entered into its first-ever\ninstitutional partnership with an environmental\norganization\u2014The Nature Conservancy of Alaska\n\u2014to support community-based management of\nsecond-growth forests for improving wildlife\nhabitat, future timber values, and several other\necosystem services. Both programs suggest an\ninstitutional change that may allow adaptation to\nnew conditions while allowing forest managers to\ncontinue to produce economic benefits for local\ncommunities, in part through timber production. At\nthe same time, globalization and changes in national\nand global values have altered the economic context\n(e.g., through expanded ecotourism; Colt et al.\n2006) and provided new ways in which the Tongass\ncan provide valuable ecosystem services to society.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND BROADER\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nGovernance of the Tongass National Forest began\nas a large-scale social experiment to bring manifest\ndestiny into the 20th century. The vision was to spur\nregional development and solidify political\ninfluence over the resource-rich Alaskan territory\nthat had been acquired by the U.S. only a few\ndecades previously. The social goal was to create\nsustainable livelihoods for local residents and\ndemonstrate the economic self-sufficiency needed\nto justify Alaskan statehood. Today, a century later,\nthe emergence of large-scale forestry, agricultural,\nand hydroelectric projects in developing nations has\na strikingly familiar tone, although now framed in\na different paradigm. These governance systems are\noften centrally designed and funded to achieve\n\npolitical, social, and economic goals, and are\nimplemented in ways that buffer against economic\nand political uncertainties so as to ensure success.\nYet our case study of the Tongass, like many others\n(Gunderson et al. 1995), suggests this \u201ccommand-\nand-control\u201d approach is bound to failure (Holling\nand Meffe 1996). How can our application of the\nadaptive-cycle diagnostic to the Tongass case help\nguide a more adaptive and sustainable governance\nof resources to achieve broad societal goals?\n\nOur case study warns against formation of a policy\nmonopoly\u2014of government funders, agency\nmanagers, and resource users\u2014for rigidly buffering\na governance system against change. This \u201ciron\ntriangle\u201d (Kingdon 1995) made the Tongass\nefficient in producing timber and supporting local\neconomic growth during its boom years, but became\nincreasingly rigid and prevented adaptation to\nchanging social preferences as well as shifting\neconomic and ecological realities. This rigidity\ncontributed to the rapid, catastrophic nature of\nsystem collapse and its persistent legacy in the\nregion. Since collapse, remnants of this policy\nmonopoly have continued to constrain institutional\nadaptive capacity\u2014over a decade since closure of\nthe last pulp mill in Alaska, most timber sales\noffered by Tongass managers are for pulp-grade\ntimber (Beier 2007), few of which are ever harvested\nin the face of vigorous legal challenges. After\ndecades of contentious debate among politicians,\nmanagers, and resource users, these actors have\nheretofore been reluctant to reach any consensus on\nalternative visions for the future of the Tongass.\n\nThe Tongass case also affirms that when agencies\ncharged with management of common property\nresources yield too much authority to narrowly\nfocused private interests, even in the pursuit of\nimproving human well-being, the public welfare\nsuffers in the long run (Ostrom 1990). Such rent-\nseeking behavior has been a common symptom\namong large-scale forest governance systems\naround the world (Repetto and Gills 1998, Ross\n2001). Our case study illustrates how boundaries\ncan be distorted between the governance of a SES\nand the management of a specific resource, and how\nnegative outcomes can emerge and persist,\nregardless of the initial purpose of managers and\ndecision makers. In other words, when governance\nbecomes too driven by a singular management\nemphasis that is rigidly organized, even the best-\nlaid plans will likely fail.\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nLastly, our case study suggests that efforts to resist\nsocial and ecological change will ultimately fail,\nand attempts to stabilize the system through rigidity\nwill constrain future adaptive capacity. The Tongass\nsystem was designed to minimize SES change in\nresponse to external perturbations and constrain\nvariability in every possible dimension: (1) political\nvariability was minimized through a policy\nmonopoly that established and safeguarded the\nlong-term lease contracts and associated subsidies;\n(2) economic variability was buffered through\nsubsidies and incentives designed to overcome local\neconomic challenges and constrain the impact of\nglobal markets on local profitability; (3) ecological\nvariability, specifically the structural heterogeneity\nof the future forest, was constrained through even-\naged management practices; and (4) institutional\nvariability, such as the growing emphasis on\nenvironmental research to understand impacts of\nmanagement activities, was suppressed through\n\u201cappropriation politics\u201d and similar measures. In\neach of these subsystems, this rigidity has resulted\nin social traps that act in concert to inhibit the\nadaptive renewal of Tongass governance, and to\nsome extent, the larger regional SES.\n\nOverall, this legacy has interrupted the Tongass\nadaptive cycle because the system has been unable\nto reorganize for renewal in the new post-collapse\ncontext. We suggest this has occurred because the\nTongass system emphasized the control of\nvariability and prevented the gradual adaptation to\nchanging social and economic conditions. An\nanalogy between a democratic society and a forest\necosystem helps illustrate this point; in both, release\nand renewal\u2014e.g., through regular elections or\nforest fires\u2014need to occur regularly. Suppressing\ninherent variability prevents these dynamics\n(Holling et al. 2002b). In such cases, if the system\nis prevented from going through these cycles\u2014for\nexample, through policy monopoly or fire\nsuppression practices\u2014then when collapse does\noccur, it is typically catastrophic, with a difficult\nlegacy that impedes renewal. In both cases, the\naftermath suggests the difference between\n\u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cpathological\u201d dynamics of an\nadaptive cycle; when pathological, the system\nremains trapped in the collapse [\u2126] phase far longer.\nFor the Tongass, as of 2009, this prolonged collapse\nhas lasted almost two decades.\n\nReorganization of the Tongass into a more\nsustainable system ultimately depends on\nreconciliation among local and national stakeholders,\n\ntheir advocates, and the agency that manages their\ninterests for the common benefit. In a study of\nsimilar deadlock in forest governance in New\nBrunswick, Canada, Baskerville (1995) showed\nhow abrupt changes in forest policy can foster such\na reconciliation, and in turn, transformation of\ngovernance toward a sustainable balance of forest\nvalues. In Alaska, several promising trends\u2014\nimproving market conditions, a growing emphasis\non managing second-growth for future values, new\npartnerships with conservation organizations, and\nnew political leadership at the state and national\nlevels\u2014suggest the critical opportunity for Tongass\nrenewal is now.\n\nResponses to this article can be read online at:\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/responses/\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nWe are grateful to A.

It traces the historical interplay of political, institutional, and economic factors that led to cycles of expansion and decline in forest management. The study highlights how federal policies, combined with global market changes, significantly influenced the governance and management practices in Tongass, eventually leading to an industrial collapse.\n\n### Key Ideas\n\n1. **Adaptive Cycle Application**: The study applies the adaptive cycle to understand the phases of growth, conservation, and collapse in the management of Tongass, emphasizing the influence of external economic and policy changes.\n\n2. **Policy and Economic Drivers**: It identifies federal policies and global market dynamics as critical drivers that shaped the governance outcomes, pointing out how policy alignments and economic conditions can precipitate systemic changes.\n\n3. **Resilience and Vulnerability**: The analysis discusses the system&#x27;s resilience provided by long-term lease contracts and how increasing rigidity contributed to its vulnerability and eventual collapse.\n\n### Relevance to Sustainable Resource Management\n\nThe findings are highly relevant to sustainable resource management, illustrating the importance of flexibility and adaptability in policy frameworks. The Tongass case study serves as a cautionary tale of how rigid policies, coupled with failure to adapt to changing economic conditions, can lead to severe resource management failures. The insights suggest that sustainable governance should incorporate adaptive management practices that can respond dynamically to ecological, economic, and social changes, promoting resilience and avoiding rigidity traps that lead to systemic collapses. This approach is crucial for managing common property resources effectively and sustainably, avoiding the pitfalls seen in the Tongass National Forest management."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "3058ef90-233d-462c-af93-e25ccfe59290", "request_id": "87d449e50fdf0e6a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "3058ef90-233d-462c-af93-e25ccfe59290", "children": ["aaa21f64-589c-451f-b77a-e2e3b533c1dd"]}, "aaa21f64-589c-451f-b77a-e2e3b533c1dd": {"id": "aaa21f64-589c-451f-b77a-e2e3b533c1dd", "message": {"id": "aaa21f64-589c-451f-b77a-e2e3b533c1dd", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714613984.739843, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["GENERALLY ADAPTABILITY IS KEY IN ALL THINGS. wHAT ARE SOME BARRIERS TO ADAPTABILITY?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87d44c94add63752-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "0fa810f6-6865-401a-acad-2570c632dad5", "children": ["f6abbdbf-1875-42fa-9dbc-da2107027ad4"]}, "f6abbdbf-1875-42fa-9dbc-da2107027ad4": {"id": "f6abbdbf-1875-42fa-9dbc-da2107027ad4", "message": {"id": "f6abbdbf-1875-42fa-9dbc-da2107027ad4", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714614005.577445, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Adaptability is indeed crucial in various contexts, from business and technology to environmental management and personal growth. However, several barriers can hinder adaptability in organizations, systems, and individuals:\n\n1. **Organizational Structure**: Rigid, hierarchical organizational structures can slow decision-making processes and inhibit the ability to respond swiftly to changing circumstances. Such structures often lack the flexibility needed to adapt to new challenges or opportunities.\n\n2. **Cultural Resistance**: Cultural norms and values that emphasize tradition over innovation can create resistance to change. In some organizations or communities, there may be a deep-rooted preference for maintaining the status quo, which can prevent the adoption of new and potentially beneficial practices.\n\n3. **Lack of Resources**: Limited financial, human, or technological resources can constrain adaptability. For example, a lack of investment in training and development can prevent employees from acquiring new skills necessary for adapting to changes in the marketplace.\n\n4. **Inadequate Information Systems**: In the absence of robust information systems, organizations might not effectively collect or analyze data essential for making informed decisions. This can lead to delays in recognizing shifts in the environment or in responding appropriately.\n\n5. **Short-term Focus**: Focusing too heavily on short-term results can deter long-term planning and investment in adaptability. This might include neglecting to develop strategies that ensure sustainability and resilience in the face of future challenges.\n\n6. **Psychological Barriers**: Fear of failure and uncertainty can discourage individuals and organizations from taking the risks associated with adapting to change. This can lead to a lack of innovation and experimentation, which are often necessary for successful adaptation.\n\n7. **Poor Leadership**: Leadership plays a crucial role in promoting or hindering adaptability. Leaders who are not committed to fostering a culture of learning and resilience may fail to encourage their teams to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n8. **Regulatory and Policy Constraints**: In some sectors, especially those heavily regulated by government policies, legal constraints can limit the ability to adapt. Regulations that do not evolve in tandem with technological and social changes can hinder progress and innovation.\n\nOvercoming these barriers often requires a deliberate shift in strategy, culture, and practices to foster an environment that not only accepts change but actively embraces and anticipates it."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "A", "parent_id": "aaa21f64-589c-451f-b77a-e2e3b533c1dd", "request_id": "87d44c94add63752-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa21f64-589c-451f-b77a-e2e3b533c1dd", "children": ["aaa2a62a-a4c6-40d6-bf68-3c773f30293d"]}, "aaa2a62a-a4c6-40d6-bf68-3c773f30293d": {"id": "aaa2a62a-a4c6-40d6-bf68-3c773f30293d", "message": {"id": "aaa2a62a-a4c6-40d6-bf68-3c773f30293d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714615529.232855, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [" What are the underlying values and perspectives on resource use and community vs. individualism that undergird the theories of Hardin\u2019s \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 vs. Ostrom\u2019s \u2018community governance\u2019?

I am\nafraid that  we do a lot of hand-waving.\n\net me start with a provocative statement. You\nwould not be reading this article if it were not for\nsome of our ancestors learning how to undertake\n\ncollective action to solve social dilem mas. Successive\ngenerations have added to the stock of everyday knowl-\nedge about how to instill productive norms of behavior\nin their children and to craft rules to support collective\naction that produces public goods and avoids &quot;trage-\ndies of the commons.&quot;I What our ancestors and con-\ntemporaries have learned about engaging in collective\naction for mutual defense,child rearing,and survival is\nnot , however, understood or explained by the extant\ntheory of collective action.\n\nThe lessons of effective collective action are not\nsimple\u2014as is obvious from human history and the\nimmense tragedies that humans have endured ,as  well\nas the successes we have realized. As global relation-\nships become even more intricately intertwined and\ncomplex,however, our survival becomes more depen-\ndent on empirically grounded scientific understanding.\nWe have not yet developed a behavioral theory of\ncollective action based on models of the individual\nconsistent with empirical evidence about how individ-\nuals make decisions in social-dilemma situations. A\nbehavioralcommitment to theory grounded in empir-\nical inquiry is essential if we are to understand such\nbasic questions as why face-to-face communication so\nconsistently enhances cooperation in social dilemmas\nor how structural variables facilitate or impede cffec-\ntive collective action.\n\nSocial dilemmas occur whenever individuals in inter-\ndependent situations face choices in which the maxi-\nmization of short-term self-interest yields outcomes\nleaving all participants worse off than feasible alterna-\ntives. In a public-good dilemma, for example, all those\nwho would benefit from the provision of a public\ngood\u2014such as pollution control, radio broadcasts  or\nweather forecasting\u2014find it costly to contribute and\nwould prefer others to pay for the good instead. If\neveryone follows the equilibrium strategy, then the\ngood is not provided or  is underprovided  Yet, every-\none would be better off if everyone were to contribute.\n\nSocial dilemmas are found in all aspects of life,\nleading to momentous decisions affecting war and\npeace as well as the mundane relationships of keeping\npromises in everyday life.Social dilemmas are called by\nmany names, including the public-good or collective-\ngood problem(Olson 1965, P.  Samuelson 1954),shirk-\ning(Alchian and Demsetz 1972), the free-rider prob-\nlem(Edney 1979,Grossman and Hart 1980),moral\nhazard(Holmstrom 1982),the credible commitment\ndilemma(Williams, Collins, and Lichbach 1997), gen-\neralized social exchange (Ekch 1974; Emerson 1972a,\n\nYet, the theory of collective action is the central\nsubject of political science  It is the core of the justifi-\ncation for the state.

But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

Beier 1,2, Amy Lauren Lovecraft 1, and F. Stuart Chapin, III 1\n\nABSTRACT. Large-scale government efforts to develop resources for societal benefit have often\nexperienced cycles of growth and decline that leave behind difficult social and ecological legacies. To\nunderstand the origins and outcomes of these failures of resource governance, scholars have applied the\nframework of the adaptive cycle. In this study, we used the adaptive cycle as a diagnostic approach to trace\nthe drivers and dynamics of forest governance surrounding a boom\u2013bust sequence of industrial forest\nmanagement in one of the largest-scale resource systems in U.S. history: the Tongass National Forest in\nsoutheastern Alaska. Our application of the adaptive cycle combined a historical narrative tracing dynamics\nin political, institutional, and economic subsystems and a longitudinal analysis of an indicator of overall\nsystem behavior (timber harvests). We found that federal policies in concert with global market changes\ndrove transformative change in both forest governance (policy making) and forest management (practices),\nthrough creation and dissolution of subsidized long-term lease contracts. Evidence of the systemic resilience\nprovided by these leases was found in the analysis of industry responses to market volatility before and\nafter Tongass-specific federal reforms. Although the lease contracts stabilized the Tongass system for a\nperiod of time, they fostered a growing degree of rigidity that contributed to a severe industrial collapse\nand the subsequent emergence of complex social traps. Broader lessons from the Tongass suggest that\nlarge-scale changes occurred only when the nested economic and policy cycles were in coherence, and a\nsystemic effort to minimize social and ecological variability ultimately resulted in catastrophic collapse of\ngovernance. This collapse resulted in a pervasive and challenging legacy that prevents Tongass\nreorganization and limits the adaptive capacity of the larger social\u2013ecological system of southeastern\nAlaska. Although this legacy has inhibited system renewal for two decades, recent trends indicate the\nemergence of new opportunities for progress toward sustainable governance of the Tongass National Forest.\n\nKey Words: adaptive cycle; Alaska; forest management; resource governance; rigidity traps; U.S. National\nForests\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGovernment efforts to stimulate the development of\nnatural resources for public benefit often seek to\nimplement a vision at grand scales that, over time,\ncreates a cycle of dependency that undermines the\noriginal social purpose as well as the resource base\nthat was intended to be sustained. In the United\nStates, this has occurred with respect to agriculture\n(Light et al. 1995), forestry (Repetto 1998, Trosper\n2003), fisheries (Francis and Reiger 1995, Pauly et\nal. 2005), water (Ostrom 1990, Lee 1995), and many\nother types of resource systems (Holling and Meffe\n1996). Similar cycles of dependency have emerged\n\nthrough international aid programs to developing\nnations that were intended to create self-sufficiency\nthrough resource development. Although the goals\nof these programs are often socially admirable and\nprovide an economic stimulus to initiate changes\nthat would otherwise lack the resources to emerge\n\u2014i.e., to escape from poverty traps (Carpenter and\nBrock 2008)\u2014they often result in challenging\nsocial traps (Costanza 1987) that can constrain\noptions for future generations. Why have these\ngovernance efforts failed so consistently, and what\nlessons can be learned that would enlighten efforts\nto address new frontiers of resource governance and\npublic welfare in a rapidly changing world?\n\n1University of Alaska-Fairbanks, 2SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\nmailto:cbeier@esf.edu\nmailto:ffall@uaf.edu\nmailto:terry.chapin@uaf.edu\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nIn this article, we analyze the rise, collapse, and\naftermath of one of the largest resource governance\nprograms in the history of the United States:\nindustrial timber production in the Tongass National\nForest (Tongass) of southeastern Alaska. Although\nlarge-scale industrial forestry emerged as a\nmechanism for stimulating social welfare and\neconomic growth, the Tongass has become one of\nthe most controversial issues of public land\nmanagement in the United States (Wilkinson 1997).\nAs such, its story has been framed in several ways:\nas the central theme in the history and purpose of\nthe U.S. Forest Service in Alaska (Rakestraw 1989);\nas an acute example of political influence,\nmismanagement, and corruption resulting in\nenvironmental degradation (Durbin 1999); as a\ncomplex situation governed by entrenched\ninfluences and acrimonious personal relationships,\nas described by a former agency chief (Steen 2004);\nas a local drama of lost jobs and livelihoods due to\n\u201ceconomic vandalism\u201d by environmentalists\n(Soderberg and DuRette 1988); and as a study of\ncumulative regulatory complications and policy\nreforms resulting in conflicted governance and a\n\u201cdeadlock\u201d among institutions and stakeholder\ngroups (Nie 2006).\n\nAlthough each account yields valuable insights,\nthey present an incomplete and often normative\npicture of the Tongass case and its broader\nimplications for the regional social\u2013ecological\nsystem (SES) of southeastern Alaska; and therefore,\nprovide little guidance on how resource systems\nmight be more effectively governed for long-term\nsustainability and greater public benefit. In this\narticle, we present the first analysis that examines\nthe links among policy, institutions, economies, and\necosystems that shaped the governance of the\nTongass during the 20th century. We apply a\nresilience lens and use the framework of the\nadaptive cycle (Holling and Gunderson 2002) as a\ndiagnostic tool to investigate the nested attributes\nof the Tongass system (Ostrom 2007). Building on\na previous group of adaptive-cycle studies of\nmanagement and governance systems (Gunderson\net al. 1995), we (1) developed an adaptive-cycle\nnarrative of the Tongass coupled with a quantitative\nindicator of system behavior (annual timber\nharvests), (2) traced the adaptive cycles of policy,\ninstitutional, and economic subsystems to identify\nsynergistic feedbacks that drove transformative\nchange at larger scales, and (3) compared adaptive-\ncycle interactions among subsystems to identify\nsources of resilience and vulnerability.\n\nObjectives and Key Questions\n\nIn this case study, we apply the adaptive cycle as\nboth a theoretical framework and a diagnostic\nmethod to reveal the dynamics and interactions of\na resource governance and management system\nnested within a larger SES. We chose the adaptive\ncycle because the Tongass boom\u2013bust cycle typified\nthe \u201cpathology of resource management\u201d (Holling\nand Meffe 1996), characterized by a cyclical pattern\nof dynamics that links ecological (resource) and\nsocial (governance) systems in a higher-order\ncoupled system (SES) (Gunderson et al. 1995,\nHolling et al. 2002b). The adaptive cycle explains\nthe dynamics of a system that is initiated\n(organization [\u03b1]), mobilizes and develops (growth\n[r]), attains a stable configuration (conservation\n[K]), changes to a different structure (collapse [\u2126]),\nand begins the process anew (reorganization [\u03b1]).\nOur focus is on the coupled cycles of change in\ngovernance (through policy and leadership),\nresource management (through practices and\nplanning), and private industry (through processing\nand sale of forest products), and their overall\nimpacts on the southeastern Alaska SES. The\nadaptive-cycle framework supports the systematic\nidentification of key interactions and feedbacks\namong system components that drove system\ndynamics, allowing us to address the following\nquestions:\n\n\u25cf What factors (ecological, economic, cultural,\npolitical) had the greatest overall influence\non stability and change in Tongass\ngovernance and management?\n \n\n\u25cf What aspects of Tongass governance (via\npolicy) and forest management (via practice)\nwere especially vulnerable to drivers of\nchange?\n \n\n\u25cf How did the system stabilize itself against\nexternal perturbation?\n \n\n\u25cf What was the source of this resilience and\nhow was it eventually lost? Was collapse\ntriggered by changes in one or many aspects\nof the system?\n \n\n\u25cf What aspects of the Tongass system resulted\nin the social\u2013ecological legacy that currently\ninhibits renewal toward a more sustainable\nsystem of forest governance?\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n \n\u25cf How does this legacy inhibit progress? How\n\ncan this legacy be overcome to facilitate\nsystem renewal and restore adaptive\ncapacity?\n\nA Systems Framework\n\nWe define the \u201cTongass system\u201d as a coupled\nsystem of governance (the set of structures and\nprocesses by which people make decisions and\nshare power) and management (the set of actions\nthat manipulate a system to achieve desired\noutcomes) nested within in the larger SES. We\nrecognize three nested subsystems of the Tongass\nsystem (Fig. 1): the \u201cinstitutional subsystem,\u201d\nincluding the U.S. Forest Service, principally the\nTongass administration; the \u201cpolicy subsystem\u201d\nthat governs Tongass management and land-use\ndecision making; and the \u201ceconomic subsystem\u201d\nthat defines the structure, capacity, and efficiency\nof the regional industry and market value of its\nproducts. Each subsystem may experience adaptive\ncycles of change influenced by internal components\nand drivers of change (e.g., Tongass managers and\ntheir preferences, legislation specific to Tongass\ngovernance, and economic factors pertaining to\nlocal industry) as well as external components and\ndrivers (e.g., national leadership in the Forest\nService, federal legislation, and global timber\nmarkets) (Fig. 1). Our approach is to explain larger-\nscale SES dynamics by describing the subsystem\ndynamics, which are more easily observed and can\ngenerate transformative feedbacks at larger scales\n(Walker et al. 2004).\n\nIn this article, governance concerns the decisions\nmade regarding the policy goals for the Tongass in\nthe context of a broader vision and purpose for the\nregion of southeastern Alaska, specifically its\ncommunities and natural resources. Management is\nthe active implementation of specific practices, such\nas industrial even-aged forestry, to reach these\nobjectives. Governance emerges primarily from the\npolicy subsystem and management emerges\nprimarily from the institutional subsystem, although\nthe two are functionally coupled.\n\nFor this case study, we narrowly define the regional\necosystem with a focus on environmental factors\nthat directly influenced governance and management,\n\nand the processes that controlled ecological\nresponses to management practices. These include\nthe condition of the old-growth forest resource,\nspatial variation in forest productivity, and the\nremote and rugged geography of the region that\nshaped the options available for resource\ndevelopment (Fig. 1). We did not address\nsuccessional dynamics because these primary\nforests were largely unmodified by human actions\nwhen industrial forestry began, and because second-\ngrowth forests did not reach a harvestable age during\nthe short lifespan of industrial forestry in the region.\nHanley et al. (2005) and Beier et al. (2008) address\nthe longer-term ecological implications of clearcut\nharvesting and even-aged management practices in\nthe temperate rainforests of southeastern Alaska.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nUsing this system structure and the adaptive-cycle\nframework, we developed a historical narrative of\nthe Tongass system that traces a complete loop of\nthe adaptive cycle, beginning with the creation of\nthe Tongass National Forest (1908), passage of key\nlegislation fostering industrial development (1947),\nboom years during which timber production peaked\n(1970), collapse of the regional industry (1997), and\nthe contentious stalemate of the present day (2009).\nIn parallel with this narrative, we traced system\ndynamics using annual timber outputs, a\nquantitative variable reflecting an emergent\nproperty of the Tongass system. Based on this\nlongitudinal analysis (Fig. 2) and a historical\ntimeline of key events in Tongass governance and\nmanagement (Appendix 1), we described the\nadaptive cycle of each subsystem, the cross-\nlinkages among adaptive cycles, and events that\ntriggered \u201ctipping points\u201d in the larger SES.

Longitudinal analysis of annual timber harvest outputs from the Tongass National Forest and\nsubsystem dynamics (see Appendix 2), divided into the four phases of the adaptive cycle: organization,\ngrowth, conservation, and collapse.\n\nits earliest beginnings, Tongass managers were\npioneers of a broad vision to encourage regional\npopulation growth and establish a clear U.S.\npresence in Alaska by developing a strong, self-\nsufficient economy based on timber production\n(Rakestraw 1989, Nie 2006). The roots of the\nTongass approach\u2014to convert old-growth forests\nto \u201cmore manageable\u201d second-growth stands, while\nfueling a forest-products industry based on pulp and\nsawtimber\u2014were evident upon completion of the\nfirst federal inventories. In 1909, Tongass officials\nsuggested that pulp production was the best use of\nold-growth rainforests, that \u201cthe chief need is for a\n\nplanned harvest of the mature timber\u201d (Rakestraw\n1989:23), and recommended revision of federal law\nto allow the sale of National Forest lands for\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, this industrial approach required\nsignificant private investment to establish a\nsufficient economy of scale to make Tongass timber\nprofitable. Despite the pursuit of such investments\nby key figures, including U.S. Forest Service Chief\nWilliam Greeley in the 1920s and Alaska Regional\nForester Frank Heintzleman throughout the 1930s\nand 1940s, these efforts were thwarted by economic\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nconstraints, including poor regional infrastructure,\ndistance from markets, and the Great Depression.\n\nWorld War II and its aftermath provided the catalyst\nto implement industrial forestry in the Tongass,\nbecause American wartime demand for airplane\nlumber exceeded supplies in Oregon and\nWashington, which had been depleted during World\nWar I. To capture this opportunity, Heintzleman\nsought the advice of timber-industry executives in\npresenting his case for what became the Alaska\nSpruce Log Program (ASLP). Created as an agency\nin 1942, ASLP supplied mills in the continental\nUnited States with high-grade Sitka spruce logs\nfrom the Tongass. At the time, Tongass logging\noccurred primarily by hand-felling the best trees in\naccessible sites, such as beach fringes and river\nbottoms. However, the collective opinion of\nTongass managers, many of whom were\nprofessionally trained foresters, was that clearcutting\nwas a far superior method (Rakestraw 1989).\nTaylor\u2019s (1935) Ecology article provided scientific\njustification for the change from high grading to\nclearcutting in the Alaskan rainforest. With this\njustification, Tongass managers shifted the\nsilvicultural prescription to clearcutting and sought\nto demonstrate the economic viability of harvesting\nthe low-grade timber that comprised the majority of\nthe Tongass timber base.\n\nIn the 18 months of ASLP operation, the program\nexported 38.5 million board feet (MBF) of high-\ngrade spruce to continental U.S. mills, and\ntransferred 46 MBF of lower (utility) grade material\nto local Alaska mills. The ASLP-legislated target\nwas 100 MBF/year of high-grade Sitka spruce, with\nno mention of low-grade materials whatsoever.\nAlthough short lived, the wartime program\ndemonstrated the commercial viability of both\nsawtimber and utility-grade materials from the\nTongass. It also forged strong relationships among\nTongass officials, national policy makers, and\ntimber-industry representatives (Rakestraw 1989).\n\nIn summary, the organization [\u03b1] phase consisted\nof a series of events that initiated adaptive cycles\nsimultaneously in the institutional, policy, and\neconomic subsystems. These adaptive cycles in the\nsubsystems defined the future configuration of the\nTongass system and prepared it for transformation\n(Appendix 2). Key actors in these subsystems\nworked together to shape a common vision of\nindustrial forestry in Alaska (i.e., built the horizontal\nlinks among subsystems), which they viewed as\n\nboth the best path to economic growth and self-\nsufficiency and the best practice for using and\nmanaging the region\u2019s abundant forest resources.\n\nGrowth Phase [r] 1947\u20131975\n\nThe passage of the Tongass Timber Act (TTA) in\n1947 was a landmark event in forest governance that\nmoved the Tongass system into the growth [r] phase.\nWith the TTA, Tongass officials applied a federally\nmandated blueprint to mobilize the resources and\nexpertise required to make industrial forestry a\nreality in Alaska\u2014analogous to the rapid biomass\naccumulation and altered competitive balance\namong species in an early successional forest. In the\nTongass, this involved development of a trained\nworkforce and infrastructure; long-term timber\nleases that altered the relationship between forest\nmanagers and forest users; and increased production\nof forest products (Fig. 2). By authorizing long-term\nguaranteed contracts, favorable scaling and pricing\nrules, and several other subsidies, the TTA provided\nthe impetus needed to overcome economic\nthresholds and transform to a new state of industrial\nforestry.\n\nThe provisions of the TTA were framed by\nlegislators, Tongass officials, and timber-industry\nexecutives. The latter two groups of actors had\nnegotiated terms of lease contracts before the\nlegislation\u2019s passage (Rakestraw 1989). Other\ninterests, including other federal agencies with\nstakes in Alaska land management, were summarily\nexcluded from negotiations, and the bill received\nlittle debate in Congress. The preparation and\npassage of the TTA galvanized the close links\namong agency, legislative, and private-industry\nactors (Rakestraw 1989, Nie 2006), forming a\n\u201cpolicy monopoly\u201d (Baumgartner and Jones 1993,\nKingdon 1995, True et al. 1999) of the Tongass\nsystem, which achieved unprecedented measures to\nfoster industrial-scale forestry, including long-term\nleases that guaranteed non-competitive access to\nmillions of acres of publicly owned forest land.\nLease holders were required to operate pulp mills\nin the region and, in return, received low-interest\nloans, a favorable log-scaling system, and refunds\nof road-building costs (Soderberg and DuRette\n1988). Harvest units in leases were planned largely\nby company foresters and then released to lease\nholders on demand (without open bidding) by the\nTongass. The U.S. Forest Service planning process\nat this time was relatively unfettered by legislative\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\ncomplications, public participation, or judicial\ndecisions (Nie 2006). As a result, there was a low\ndegree of transparency and a high degree of internal\ncontrol in the execution of the long-term timber\ncontracts; such traits are characteristic of industries\noperating on public resources through a policy\nmonopoly (Repetto 1988).\n\nEarly in this period, the Tongass system mobilized\nrapidly in the direction prescribed and supported by\nits policy monopoly. Immediately after the TTA,\nthe U.S. Forest Service and the newly formed\nKetchikan Pulp Company (KPC) agreed to\npreliminary terms of a lease contract. The KPC\ncontract was finalized in 1951 and guaranteed over\n8.5 billion board feet of timber over 50 years, subject\nto 5-year reviews by the U.S. Forest Service; the\nKPC contract set aside nearly one-fifth of the\nTongass for exclusive bidding rights (Soderberg and\nDuRette 1988). In 1953, the Japanese-owned\nAlaska Pulp Development Co. was incorporated in\nthe United States and signed a 50-year, 4.5 billion\nboard foot contract requiring construction of a large\nsawmill and pulp mill in Sitka. By 1959, the Alaska\nPulp Company (APC) was in operation in Sitka.\nAnother long-term contract with the Pacific\nNorthwest Timber Co. was finalized with the\nconstruction of large sawmill in Wrangell. Other\nlease offerings included large tracts in some of the\nmost biologically rich areas of the Tongass, e.g.,\none lease included nearly 90% of productive forests\non Admiralty Island, which today exists as a\nkeystone reserve of regional biodiversity (Beier\n2008).\n\nWithin 5 years of passage of the TTA, roughly 14\nbillion board feet of Tongass timber was under\ncontract to lease holders. In 1953, Regional Forester\nHeintzleman retired from the U.S. Forest Service\nand was appointed Territorial Governor of Alaska,\nwhere he continued vigorous pursuit of\nprogressively larger timber leases in the region\n(Rakestraw 1989). The three existing lease contracts\nproduced over 90% of Tongass timber harvested\nduring the 1960s and 1970s. In the early 1970s, the\nsystem\u2019s growth phase reached several milestones:\nmaximum annual harvest from the Tongass (560\nMBF), maximum Alaskan share of U.S. timber\nexports to Japan (42%), and the small town of\nKetchikan became the third-largest producer of\ncellulose pulp in the world.\n\nDuring this period, a series of legislative and judicial\ndecisions (Appendix 3), beginning in 1960 with the\n\nMultiple Use Sustained Yield Act (MUSYA), began\nto erode the discretional authority of the U.S. Forest\nService (LeMaster 1984). These \u201cperturbations\u201d to\nthe Tongass policy subsystem were largely driven\nby the growing influence of the U.S. environmental\nmovement. With the exception of one major lawsuit\n(Sierra Club v Hardin), these events were not\nspecific to the Tongass and did not significantly\ninfluence system behavior, based on harvest trends\n(Fig. 2). However, these events did begin to\nchallenge the Tongass policy monopoly and its\ncontrol over forest governance by establishing new\nrules and venues for debate and decision making.\nFor this reason, these events provide a window into\nhow the Tongass system was stabilized, or\nconserved, in the face of change\u2014these interactions\nare the focus of the following section.\n\nIn summary, during the growth [r] phase, Tongass\ntimber outputs grew rapidly and stabilized at a\nharvest level roughly 20 times greater than during\nthe organization [\u03b1] phase (Fig. 2). This\ntransformation in the Tongass system resulted from\na solidification of the links among the institutional,\npolicy, and economic subsystems, creating a rigid\nsystem that had minimal transparency or links to\nother processes such as the environmental lobby or\nsmall-scale logging companies that had interests in\nTongass governance. The mills in Ketchikan, Sitka,\nand Wrangell prospered, and the regional industry\nsupported an estimated 3500 local jobs and\nnumerous local schools, which benefited from\ndirect transfers of timber-based revenues (Allen et\nal. 1998). At the beginning of the [r] phase,\nlegislation created positive feedbacks in the policy\nsubsystem that triggered implementation of the\nTongass system; and toward its conclusion,\nlegislation created negative feedbacks that\nincreased the rigidity of internal links among all\nsubsystems of the Tongass. During this period, the\neconomic subsystem was driven largely by positive\nfeedbacks fostering continued growth in forest-\nproducts manufacturing (Appendix 2), which\npeaked in 1970. Because of the tight links among\nthe three subsystems, the positive feedbacks in the\npolicy and economic subsystems drove the growth\nof the Tongass system.\n\nConservation phase [K] 1975\u20131990\n\nBefore 1975, the Tongass system and its policy\nmonopoly remained largely unfettered by changes\nin public opinion and federal policy associated with\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nthe environmental movement. In 1975, for the first\ntime, a federal court ruled against the practice of\nclearcut logging in the Tongass. This event moved\nthe Tongass system into a conservation [K] phase\n\u2014a state analogous to the \u201cclimax\u201d stage of a mature\nforest when the dominant canopy trees strongly\ninfluence endogenous conditions and the system is\nlargely resilient to disturbance (Holling and\nGunderson 2002). During this phase, the Tongass\nsystem faced external, converging drivers of change\nin public policy (Nie 2006), institutional\ngovernance (LeMaster 1984), and global markets\n(Crone 2004). The interactions of these drivers with\ncomponents of the Tongass system revealed the\nmechanisms providing stability and resilience, as\nwell as incipient vulnerabilities.

This theory is undergirded by the values of individualism and the assumption that resources are limited and must be protected from overuse by individual actors. Hardin&#x27;s approach often suggests regulatory or privatization solutions to manage resources.\n\n**Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s &#x27;Community Governance&#x27;** counters the tragedy by showing how local communities can successfully manage resources without external controls or privatization, through collective action and self-governance. Her theory is grounded in values of community, mutual benefits, and adaptability, demonstrating that collective, context-specific solutions can sustainably manage resources.\n\n### Assumptions in Hardin&#x27;s Theory\n\nHardin assumes that:\n1. **Rational Individuals:** People act independently based on rational self-interest, leading inevitably to resource overuse.\n2. **Limited Resources:** Resources are finite and must be either regulated or privatized to prevent depletion.\n3. **Necessity of External Intervention:** External authorities or privatization are needed to manage resources sustainably.\n\nI would argue that while Hardin&#x27;s view helps understand certain dilemmas like pollution or overfishing, it does not account for the complexities of human behavior and the potential for cooperative governance seen in Ostrom\u2019s work. Ostrom\u2019s approach acknowledges the capabilities of communities to create rules and institutions that manage resources effectively without external enforcement.\n\n### Systems of Controls\n\n**Hardin\u2019s Solutions:** Often involve top-down regulations or privatizing resources to align individual incentives with societal good.\n\n**Ostrom\u2019s Solutions:** Focus on bottom-up, community-based management where rules are adapted to specific local conditions and resource systems, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability.\n\n### Real-World Example: Palm Oil Industry\n\n#### Sustainability Measures and Transparency\nThe palm oil industry, often criticized for deforestation and habitat destruction, has seen initiatives like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) which certifies sustainable palm oil production. Companies under RSPO must adhere to criteria ensuring environmental, economic, and social sustainability.\n\n#### Ethical Production Ratings\nSome palm oil producers have received certifications indicating better practices, but global standards vary significantly, and enforcement is uneven.\n\n#### Potential Improvements\nCompanies could improve by enhancing transparency in supply chains, committing to zero deforestation, and increasing support for smallholder farmers.\n\n#### Argument for Additional Sustainability Measures\nImplementing stricter sustainability measures could significantly benefit the environment by reducing deforestation and carbon emissions. Social benefits include improved conditions for workers and reduced conflict over land. These benefits likely outweigh the costs of implementing such measures, which include increased financial investments and potential short-term decreases in profit margins.\n\n#### Enforcement\nEnforcement could be managed through stricter national regulations, international agreements, and consumer pressure demanding certified products.\n\n#### Complexity and Cost\nTransitioning to sustainable practices involves complex changes in supply chain management, increased costs for certification, and potentially higher operational costs. However, the long-term benefits of maintaining biodiversity, reducing carbon footprints, and improving social outcomes provide a compelling case for these changes.\n\nThis analysis shows the contrast between Hardin&#x27;s approach, which might argue for stringent controls or privatization, and Ostrom&#x27;s, which would advocate for community-led initiatives and local governance structures tailored to the specific context of the palm oil industry."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAA", "parent_id": "0597b77a-c11d-41ab-a19d-c85c2875176a", "request_id": "87d4724f9f47a265-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "0597b77a-c11d-41ab-a19d-c85c2875176a", "children": ["aaa29a3a-2355-419e-8c5a-adb42fb04fc8"]}, "aaa29a3a-2355-419e-8c5a-adb42fb04fc8": {"id": "aaa29a3a-2355-419e-8c5a-adb42fb04fc8", "message": {"id": "aaa29a3a-2355-419e-8c5a-adb42fb04fc8", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714706513.430023, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["cAN YOU USE THE olive oil production industry in italy as an example?

The industry faces sustainability and ethical production challenges that are closely tied to environmental and social factors.\n\n#### Sustainability Measures and Transparency\nItalian olive oil producers often adopt sustainable practices such as organic farming, which avoids the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, reducing environmental impact and promoting biodiversity. Some producers also use modern irrigation systems that conserve water, a critical resource in Mediterranean agriculture.\n\n#### Ethical Production Ratings\nItaly, being part of the European Union, adheres to stringent EU regulations that cover environmental protection, labor rights, and food safety. These regulations ensure a high standard of ethical production. Additionally, certifications like the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) not only assure quality and region-specific characteristics but also promote ethical production practices by maintaining traditional methods that are often more sustainable.\n\n#### Potential Improvements\nWhile many Italian olive oil producers are moving towards sustainability, there is room for improvement, especially in reducing the carbon footprint associated with packaging and distribution. Producers could also enhance transparency in their supply chains, providing consumers with detailed information about the sourcing of olives and the production processes.\n\n#### Argument for Additional Sustainability Measures\nImplementing further sustainability measures in the Italian olive oil industry could lead to significant environmental benefits, such as greater soil health and reduced water use. Social benefits include sustaining rural communities and preserving traditional agricultural practices that are a part of Italy\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\n#### Enforcement\nSustainability measures can be enforced through national regulations that align with EU policies, coupled with incentives for farmers to adopt sustainable practices. Industry associations like Assitol could play a critical role in promoting these practices through education and certification programs.\n\n#### Complexity and Cost\nAdopting advanced sustainable technologies and practices might involve high initial costs, but these can be offset by long-term gains such as increased efficiency, improved product quality, and access to markets that value sustainability. Costs might also be mitigated by government subsidies and EU funding aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture.\n\n#### System Change Challenges\nTransitioning to more sustainable production involves overcoming challenges like the small scale of many olive farms, which can make it difficult to invest in new technologies. However, cooperative models and shared resources among small producers can facilitate this transition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Italian olive oil industry&#x27;s move towards increased sustainability and ethical production is not only feasible but beneficial both environmentally and socially. While challenges exist, particularly in terms of cost and complexity, the long-term benefits of such initiatives significantly outweigh these difficulties. The application of Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s community governance approach could be particularly effective here, leveraging local knowledge and collective action to manage resources sustainably while preserving the cultural heritage of Italian olive oil production.\n\nThis example reflects a shift from traditional regulatory approaches towards more community-based, adaptive management strategies that align with Ostrom&#x27;s theories, contrasting with Hardin&#x27;s more rigid control measures."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "A", "parent_id": "aaa29a3a-2355-419e-8c5a-adb42fb04fc8", "request_id": "87dd20c92bc04c68-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa29a3a-2355-419e-8c5a-adb42fb04fc8", "children": ["aaa2db6e-174e-4b9f-86ed-94429353990a"]}, "aaa2db6e-174e-4b9f-86ed-94429353990a": {"id": "aaa2db6e-174e-4b9f-86ed-94429353990a", "message": {"id": "aaa2db6e-174e-4b9f-86ed-94429353990a", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714706952.210642, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What is the theory of Collective Action which is central to economics?

This theory explores how to provide public goods and manage common resources effectively, often challenging situations where individual rationality does not lead to rational outcomes for the group.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Theory of Collective Action\n\n1. **Public Goods**: These are goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning no one can be excluded from using the good, and one person&#x27;s use does not reduce availability to others. Classic examples include public parks, clean air, and national defense. The theory of collective action seeks to address how such goods can be efficiently provided since they often lead to free-riding behavior where individuals benefit from resources without contributing to their provision.\n\n2. **Free-Rider Problem**: This is a central issue in the theory of collective action. Since everyone can use a public good whether they pay for it or not, individuals may decide not to contribute financially or effort-wise, hoping that others will cover the cost. This behavior can lead to under-provision or non-provision of the necessary goods.\n\n3. **Social Dilemmas**: The theory often deals with social dilemmas like the &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource. Garrett Hardin&#x27;s essay on this topic illustrates how shared resources can be overused and destroyed.\n\n4. **Solutions and Institutional Responses**: Mancur Olson, in his book &quot;The Logic of Collective Action,&quot; argues that larger groups need some form of extra incentive to get their members to act in their common interest. Solutions may include coercive government intervention, regulations, privatization, or the creation of institutions that align individual incentives with group goals. Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s work extends this by showing that communities can often self-organize to manage resources sustainably without external authorities if appropriate group norms and rules are established.\n\n### Economic Implications\n\nThe theory has profound implications for economic policies, particularly in how governments and organizations design mechanisms to fund public goods and manage common resources. It impacts tax policies, regulatory approaches, and the provision of subsidies. It also influences international economics in areas like climate change agreements and collective security arrangements.\n\n### Political Science Relevance\n\nIn political science, the theory of collective action informs understanding of how political coalitions form, how lobbying works, and how collective political movements can influence policy changes. It helps explain why some groups are more powerful and effective than others in getting their interests represented in public policy.\n\nThe theory of collective action is crucial in understanding many economic and political behaviors and forms the basis for designing policies that can overcome collective action problems to achieve better outcomes for society as a whole."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2db6e-174e-4b9f-86ed-94429353990a", "request_id": "87dd2a515f580e56-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2db6e-174e-4b9f-86ed-94429353990a", "children": ["aaa2081c-7c77-4e06-abe7-ddfb9738dcbe"]}, "aaa2081c-7c77-4e06-abe7-ddfb9738dcbe": {"id": "aaa2081c-7c77-4e06-abe7-ddfb9738dcbe", "message": {"id": "aaa2081c-7c77-4e06-abe7-ddfb9738dcbe", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714707541.860516, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["give outline, summarize and provide an overview of the key ideas presented"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-kl8goQrC96zkHBIkko9pui2a", "size": 597250, "name": "gospel_of_wealth_2017.pdf", "mime_type": "application/pdf"}], "request_id": "87dd38b4accc4bde-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e10f5f87-c1a0-42f5-8870-85f7c8a605cb", "children": ["c1ab741b-88de-4cb6-9c5f-36ce6261ab34"]}, "c1ab741b-88de-4cb6-9c5f-36ce6261ab34": {"id": "c1ab741b-88de-4cb6-9c5f-36ce6261ab34", "message": {"id": "c1ab741b-88de-4cb6-9c5f-36ce6261ab34", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714707566.926052, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "file-kl8goQrC96zkHBIkko9pui2a", "domain": "gospel_of_wealth_2017.pdf", "text": "\nThe Scottish-born industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie \n(1835\u20131919) was one of the titans of America\u2019s Gilded Age.

The conditions of human life have not only been \nchanged, but revolutionized, within the past few hundred years. \nIn former days there was little difference between the dwell-\ning, dress, food, and environment of the chief and those of his \nretainers. The Indians are today where civilized man then was. \nWhen visiting the Sioux, I was led to the wigwam of the chief. It \nwas just like the others in external appearance, and even within \nthe difference was trifling between it and those of the poorest \nof his braves. The contrast between the palace of the million-\naire and the cottage of the laborer with us today measures the \nchange which has come with civilization. \n\nThis change, however, is not to be deplored, but welcomed as \nhighly beneficial. It is well, nay, essential for the progress of the \nrace, that the houses of some should be homes for all that is \nhighest and best in literature and the arts, and for all the refine-\nments of civilization, rather than that none should be so. Much \nbetter this great irregularity than universal squalor. Without \nwealth there can be no Maecenas. The \u201cgood old times\u201d were not \ngood old times. Neither master nor servant was as well situated \nthen as today. A relapse to old conditions would be disastrous \nto both\u2014not the least so to him who serves\u2014and would sweep \n\n I. \nWEALTH\n\n\n\n2\n\naway civilization with it. But whether the change be for good or \nill, it is upon us, beyond our power to alter, and therefore to be \naccepted and made the best of. It is a waste of time to criticize \nthe inevitable.\n\nIt is easy to see how the change has come. One illustration will \nserve for almost every phase of the cause. In the manufacture of \nproducts we have the whole story. It applies to all combinations \nof human industry, as stimulated and enlarged by the inventions \nof this scientific age. Formerly articles were manufactured at \nthe domestic hearth or in small shops which formed part of the \nhousehold. The master and his apprentices worked side by side, \nthe latter living with the master, and therefore subject to the \nsame conditions. When these apprentices rose to be masters, \nthere was little or no change in their mode of life, and they, in \nturn, educated in the same routine succeeding apprentices. \nThere was, substantially, social equality, and even political \nequality, for those engaged in industrial pursuits had then little \nor no political voice in the State.\n\nBut the inevitable result of such a mode of manufacture was \ncrude articles at high prices. Today the world obtains commod-\nities of excellent quality at prices which even the generation \npreceding this would have deemed incredible. In the commer-\ncial world similar causes have produced similar results, and the \nrace is benefited thereby. The poor enjoy what the rich could not \nbefore afford. What were the luxuries have become the necessar-\nies of life. The laborer has now more comforts than the farmer \nhad a few generations ago. The farmer has more luxuries than \nthe landlord had, and is more richly clad and better housed. The \nlandlord has books and pictures rarer, and appointments more \nartistic, than the King could then obtain.\n\nThe price we pay for this salutary change is, no doubt, great. We \nassemble thousands of operatives in the factory, in the mine, \n\n\n\n3THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nand in the countinghouse, of whom the employer can know \nlittle or nothing, and to whom the employer is little better than \na myth. All intercourse between them is at an end. Rigid Castes \nare formed, and, as usual, mutual ignorance breeds mutual \ndistrust. Each Caste is without sympathy for the other, and \nready to credit anything disparaging in regard to it. Under the \nlaw of competition, the employer of thousands is forced into the \nstrictest economies, among which the rates paid to labor figure \nprominently, and often there is friction between the employer \nand the employed, between capital and labor, between rich and \npoor. Human society loses homogeneity.\n\nThe price which society pays for the law of competition, like the \nprice it pays for cheap comforts and luxuries, is also great; but \nthe advantages of this law are also greater still, for it is to this \nlaw that we owe our wonderful material development, which \nbrings improved conditions in its train. But, whether the law \nbe benign or not, we must say of it, as we say of the change in \nthe conditions of men to which we have referred: It is here; we \ncannot evade it; no substitutes for it have been found; and while \nthe law may be sometimes hard for the individual, it is best for \nthe race, because it insures the survival of the fittest in every \ndepartment. We accept and welcome, therefore, as conditions \nto which we must accommodate ourselves, great inequality \nof environment, the concentration of business, industrial and \ncommercial, in the hands of a few, and the law of competition \nbetween these, as being not only beneficial, but essential for the \nfuture progress of the race. Having accepted these, it follows \nthat there must be great scope for the exercise of special ability \nin the merchant and in the manufacturer who has to conduct \naffairs upon a great scale. That this talent for organization \nand management is rare among men is proved by the fact that \nit invariably secures for its possessor enormous rewards, no \nmatter where or under what laws or conditions. The experienced \nin affairs always rate the man whose services can be obtained \n\n\n\n4\n\nas a partner as not only the first consideration, but such as to \nrender the question of his capital scarcely worth considering, for \nsuch men soon create capital; while, without the special talent \nrequired, capital soon takes wings. Such men become interested \nin firms or corporations using millions; and estimating only \nsimple interest to be made upon the capital invested, it is inevi-\ntable that their income must exceed their expenditures, and that \nthey must accumulate wealth. Nor is there any middle ground \nwhich such men can occupy, because the great manufacturing or \ncommercial concern which does not earn at least interest upon \nits capital soon becomes bankrupt. It must either go forward or \nfall behind: to stand still is impossible. It is a condition essential \nfor its successful operation that it should be thus far profitable, \nand even that, in addition to interest on capital, it should make \nprofit. It is a law, as certain as any of the others named, that \nmen possessed of this peculiar talent for affairs, under the free \nplay of economic forces, must, of necessity, soon be in receipt \nof more revenue than can be judiciously expended upon them-\nselves; and this law is as beneficial for the race as the others.\n\nObjections to the foundations upon which society is based are \nnot in order, because the condition of the race is better with \nthese than it has been with any others which have been tried. \nOf the effect of any new substitutes proposed we cannot be \nsure. The Socialist or Anarchist who seeks to overturn pres-\nent conditions is to be regarded as attacking the foundation \nupon which civilization itself rests, for civilization took its start \nfrom the day that the capable, industrious workman said to his \nincompetent and lazy fellow, \u201cIf thou dost not sow, thou shalt \nnot reap,\u201d and thus ended primitive Communism by separat-\ning the drones from the bees. One who studies this subject will \nsoon be brought face to face with the conclusion that upon the \nsacredness of property civilization itself depends\u2014the right \nof the laborer to his hundred dollars in the savings bank, and \nequally the legal right of the millionaire to his millions. To \n\n\n\n5THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nthose who propose to substitute Communism for this intense \nIndividualism the answer, therefore, is: The race has tried that. \nAll progress from that barbarous day to the present time has \nresulted from its displacement. Not evil, but good, has come to \nthe race from the accumulation of wealth by those who have the \nability and energy that produce it. But even if we admit for a \nmoment that it might be better for the race to discard its present \nfoundation, Individualism\u2014that it is a nobler ideal that man \n\nshould labor, not for himself alone, but in and for a brotherhood \nof his fellows, and share with them all in common, realizing \nSwedenborg\u2019s idea of Heaven, where, as he says, the angels \nderive their happiness, not from laboring for self, but for each \nother\u2014even admit all this, and a sufficient answer is, This is not \nevolution, but revolution. It necessitates the changing of human \nnature itself\u2014a work of eons, even if it were good to change it, \nwhich we cannot know. It is not practicable in our day or in our \nage. Even if desirable theoretically, it belongs to another and \nlong-succeeding sociological stratum. Our duty is with what \nis practicable now; with the next step possible in our day and \ngeneration. It is criminal to waste our energies in endeavoring to \nuproot, when all we can profitably or possibly accomplish is to \nbend the universal tree of humanity a little in the direction most \nfavorable to the production of good fruit under existing circum-\nstances. We might as well urge the destruction of the highest \n\nOur duty is with what is  \npracticable now; with  \nthe next step possible in  \nour day and generation.\n\n\n\n6\n\nexisting type of man because he failed to reach our ideal as to \nfavor the destruction of Individualism, Private Property, the \nLaw of Accumulation of Wealth, and the Law of Competition; \nfor these are the highest results of human experience, the soil \nin which society so far has produced the best fruit. Unequally or \nunjustly, perhaps, as these laws sometimes operate, and imper-\nfect as they appear to the Idealist, they are, nevertheless, like \nthe highest type of man, the best and most valuable of all that \nhumanity has yet accomplished.\n\nWe start, then, with a condition of affairs under which the best \ninterests of the race are promoted, but which inevitably gives \nwealth to the few. Thus far, accepting conditions as they exist, \nthe situation can be surveyed and pronounced good. The ques-\ntion then arises\u2014and, if the foregoing be correct, it is the only \nquestion with which we have to deal\u2014What is the proper mode \nof administering wealth after the laws upon which civilization \nis founded have thrown it into the hands of the few? And it is of \nthis great question that I believe I offer the true solution. It will \nbe understood that fortunes are here spoken of, not moderate \nsums saved by many years of effort, the returns from which \nare required for the comfortable maintenance and education \nof families. This is not wealth, but only competence, which it \nshould be the aim of all to acquire.\n\nThere are but three modes in which surplus wealth can be \ndisposed of. It can be left to the families of the decedents; or \nit can be bequeathed for public purposes; or, finally, it can be \nadministered during their lives by its possessors. Under the \nfirst and second modes most of the wealth of the world that \nhas reached the few has hitherto been applied. Let us in turn \nconsider each of these modes. The first is the most injudicious. \nIn monarchical countries, the estates and the greatest portion of \nthe wealth are left to the first son, that the vanity of the parent \nmay be gratified by the thought that his name and title are to \n\n\n\n7THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\ndescend to succeeding generations unimpaired. The condition \nof this class in Europe today teaches the futility of such hopes or \nambitions. The successors have become impoverished through \ntheir follies or from the fall in the value of land. Even in Great \nBritain the strict law of entail has been found inadequate to \nmaintain the status of a hereditary class. Its soil is rapidly pass-\ning into the hands of the stranger. Under republican institutions \nthe division of property among the children is much fairer, \nbut the question which forces itself upon thoughtful men in all \nlands is: Why should men leave great fortunes to their children? \nIf this is done from affection, is it not misguided affection? \nObservation teaches that, generally speaking, it is not well \nfor the children that they should be so burdened. Neither is it \nwell for the state. Beyond providing for the wife and daughters \nmoderate sources of income, and very moderate allowances \nindeed, if any, for the sons, men may well hesitate, for it is no \nlonger questionable that great sums bequeathed oftener work \nmore for the injury than for the good of the recipients. Wise men \nwill soon conclude that, for the best interests of the members of \ntheir families and of the state, such bequests are an improper \nuse of their means.\n\nIt is not suggested that men who have failed to educate their sons \nto earn a livelihood shall cast them adrift in poverty. If any man \nhas seen fit to rear his sons with a view to their living idle lives, \nor, what is highly commendable, has instilled in them the senti-\nment that they are in a position to labor for public ends without \nreference to pecuniary considerations, then, of course, the duty \nof the parent is to see that such are provided for in moderation. \nThere are instances of millionaires\u2019 sons unspoiled by wealth, \nwho, being rich, still perform great services in the community. \nSuch are the very salt of the earth, as valuable as, unfortunately, \nthey are rare; still it is not the exception, but the rule, that men \nmust regard, and, looking at the usual result of enormous sums \nconferred upon legatees, the thoughtful man must shortly say, \n\n\n\n8\n\n\u201cI would as soon leave to my son a curse as the almighty dollar,\u201d \nand admit to himself that it is not the welfare of the children, but \nfamily pride, which inspires these enormous legacies.\n\nAs to the second mode, that of leaving wealth at death for public \nuses, it may be said that this is only a means for the disposal of \nwealth, provided a man is content to wait until he is dead before \nit becomes of much good in the world. Knowledge of the results \nof legacies bequeathed is not calculated to inspire the brightest \nhopes of much posthumous good being accomplished. The cases \nare not few in which the real object sought by the testator is not \nattained, nor are they few in which his real wishes are thwarted. \nIn many cases the bequests are so used as to become only \nmonuments of his folly. It is well to remember that it requires \nthe exercise of not less ability than that which acquired the \nwealth to use it so as to be really beneficial to the community. \nBesides this, it may fairly be said that no man is to be extolled \nfor doing what he cannot help doing, nor is he to be thanked by \nthe community to which he only leaves wealth at death. Men \nwho leave vast sums in this way may fairly be thought men who \nwould not have left it at all, had they been able to take it with \nthem. The memories of such cannot be held in grateful remem-\nbrance, for there is no grace in their gifts. It is not to be wondered \nat that such bequests seem so generally to lack the blessing.\n\nThe growing disposition to tax more and more heavily large \nestates left at death is a cheering indication of the growth of a \nsalutary change in public opinion. The State of Pennsylvania \nnow takes\u2014subject to some exceptions\u2014one-tenth of the \nproperty left by its citizens. The budget presented in the British \nParliament the other day proposes to increase the death duties; \nand, most significant of all, the new tax is to be a graduated \none. Of all forms of taxation, this seems the wisest. Men who \ncontinue hoarding great sums all their lives, the proper use \nof which for public ends would work good to the community, \n\n\n\n9THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nshould be made to feel that the community, in the form of the \nstate, cannot thus be deprived of its proper share. By taxing \nestates heavily at death the state marks its condemnation of the \nselfish millionaire\u2019s unworthy life.\n\nIt is desirable that nations should go much further in this direc-\ntion. Indeed, it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich \nman\u2019s estate which should go at his death to the public through \nthe agency of the state, and by all means such taxes should be \ngraduated, beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to depen-\ndents, and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell, until of the \nmillionaire\u2019s hoard, as of Shylock\u2019s, at least\n\n  The other half\n Comes to the privy coffer of the state.\n\nThis policy would work powerfully to induce the rich man to \nattend to the administration of wealth during his life, which is \nthe end that society should always have in view, as being that \nby far most fruitful for the people. Nor need it be feared that \nthis policy would sap the root of enterprise and render men less \nanxious to accumulate, for to the class whose ambition it is to \nleave great fortunes and be talked about after their death, it will \nattract even more attention, and, indeed, be a somewhat nobler \nambition to have enormous sums paid over to the state from \ntheir fortunes.\n\nThere remains, then, only one mode of using great fortunes; \nbut in this we have the true antidote for the temporary unequal \ndistribution of wealth, the reconciliation of the rich and the \npoor\u2014a reign of harmony\u2014another ideal, differing, indeed, \nfrom that of the Communist in requiring only the further \nevolution of existing conditions, not the total overthrow of our \ncivilization. It is founded upon the present most intense individ-\nualism, and the race is prepared to put it in practice by degrees \nwhenever it pleases. Under its sway we shall have an ideal state, \n\n\n\n10\n\nin which the surplus wealth of the few will become, in the best \nsense, the property of the many, because administered for the \ncommon good, and this wealth, passing through the hands of \nthe few, can be made a much more potent force for the elevation \nof our race than if it had been distributed in small sums to the \npeople themselves. Even the poorest can be made to see this, \nand to agree that great sums gathered by some of their fellow \ncitizens and spent for public purposes, from which the masses \nreap the principal benefit, are more valuable to them than if \nscattered among them through the course of many years in \ntrifling amounts.\n\nIf we consider what results flow from the Cooper Institute, \nfor instance, to the best portion of the race in New York not \npossessed of means, and compare these with those which would \nhave arisen for the good of the masses from an equal sum \ndistributed by Mr. Cooper in his lifetime in the form of wages, \nwhich is the highest form of distribution, being for work done \nand not for charity, we can form some estimate of the possibili-\nties for the improvement of the race which lie embedded in the \npresent law of the accumulation of wealth. Much of this sum, if \ndistributed in small quantities among the people, would have \nbeen wasted in the indulgence of appetite, some of it in excess, \nand it may be doubted whether even the part put to the best use, \nthat of adding to the comforts of the home, would have yielded \nresults for the race, as a race, at all comparable to those which \nare flowing and are to flow from the Cooper Institute from \ngeneration to generation. Let the advocate of violent or radical \nchange ponder well this thought.\n\nWe might even go so far as to take another instance, that of Mr. \nTilden\u2019s bequest of five millions of dollars for a free library in \nthe city of New York, but in referring to this one cannot help \nsaying involuntarily, How much better if Mr. Tilden had devoted \nthe last years of his own life to the proper administration of this \n\n\n\n11THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nimmense sum; in which case neither legal contest nor any other \ncause of delay could have interfered with his aims. But let us \nassume that Mr. Tilden\u2019s millions finally become the means of \ngiving to this city a noble public library, where the treasures of \nthe world contained in books will be open to all forever, without \nmoney and without price. Considering the good of that part of \nthe race which congregates in and around Manhattan Island, \nwould its permanent benefit have been better promoted had \nthese millions been allowed to circulate in small sums through \nthe hands of the masses? Even the most strenuous advocate of \nCommunism must entertain a doubt upon this subject. Most of \nthose who think will probably entertain no doubt whatever.\n\nPoor and restricted are our opportunities in this life; narrow our \nhorizon; our best work most imperfect; but rich men should be \nthankful for one inestimable boon. They have it in their power \nduring their lives to busy themselves in organizing benefac-\ntions from which the masses of their fellows will derive lasting \nadvantage, and thus dignify their own lives. The highest life \nis probably to be reached, not by such imitation of the life of \nChrist as Count Tolstoy gives us, but, while animated by Christ\u2019s \nspirit, by recognizing the changed conditions of this age, and \n\nPoor and restricted are our opportunities in \nthis life; narrow our horizon; our best work \nmost imperfect; but rich men should be thankful \nfor one inestimable boon. They have it in their \npower during their lives to busy themselves in \norganizing benefactions from which the masses \nof their fellows will derive lasting advantage, \nand thus dignify their own lives.\n\n\n\n12\n\nadopting modes of expressing this spirit suitable to the changed \nconditions under which we live; still laboring for the good of \nour fellows, which was the essence of his life and teaching, but \nlaboring in a different manner.\n\nThis, then, is held to be the duty of the man of Wealth: First, \nto set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning \ndisplay or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legiti-\nmate wants of those dependent upon him; and after doing so \nto consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as \ntrust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly \nbound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, in \nhis judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial \nresults for the community\u2014the man of wealth thus becoming \nthe mere agent and trustee for his poorer brethren, bringing \nto their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to \nadminister, doing for them better than they would or could do \nfor themselves.\n\nWe are met here with the difficulty of determining what are \nmoderate sums to leave to members of the family; what is \nmodest, unostentatious living; what is the test of extravagance. \nThere must be different standards for different conditions. The \nanswer is that it is as impossible to name exact amounts or \nactions as it is to define good manners, good taste, or the rules \nof propriety; but, nevertheless, these are verities, well known \nalthough undefinable. Public sentiment is quick to know and \nto feel what offends these. So in the case of wealth. The rule in \nregard to good taste in the dress of men or women applies here. \nWhatever makes one conspicuous offends the canon. If any \nfamily be chiefly known for display, for extravagance in home, \ntable, equipage, for enormous sums ostentatiously spent in \nany form upon itself\u2014if these be its chief distinctions, we have \nno difficulty in estimating its nature or culture. So likewise in \nregard to the use or abuse of its surplus wealth, or to generous, \n\n\n\n13THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nfree-handed cooperation in good public uses, or to unabated \nefforts to accumulate and hoard to the last, whether they \nadminister or bequeath. The verdict rests with the best and most \nenlightened public sentiment. The community will surely judge, \nand its judgments will not often be wrong.\n\nThe best uses to which surplus wealth can be put have already \nbeen indicated. Those who would administer wisely must, \nindeed, be wise, for one of the serious obstacles to the improve-\nment of our race is indiscriminate charity. It were better for \nmankind that the millions of the rich were thrown into the sea \nthan so spent as to encourage the slothful, the drunken, the \nunworthy. Of every thousand dollars spent in so called char-\nity today, it is probable that $950 is unwisely spent; so spent, \nindeed, as to produce the very evils which it proposes to miti-\ngate or cure. A well-known writer of philosophic books admitted \nthe other day that he had given a quarter of a dollar to a man \nwho approached him as he was coming to visit the house of \nhis friend. He knew nothing of the habits of this beggar; knew \nnot the use that would be made of this money, although he \nhad every reason to suspect that it would be spent improperly. \nThis man professed to be a disciple of Herbert Spencer; yet the \nquarter dollar given that night will probably work more injury \nthan all the money which its thoughtless donor will ever be able \nto give in true charity will do good. He only gratified his own \nfeelings, saved himself from annoyance\u2014and this was probably \none of the most selfish and very worst actions of his life, for in \nall respects he is most worthy.\n\nIn bestowing charity, the main consideration should be to help \nthose who will help themselves; to provide part of the means \nby which those who desire to improve may do so; to give those \nwho desire to rise the aids by which they may rise; to assist, but \nrarely or never to do all. Neither the individual nor the race is \nimproved by almsgiving. Those worthy of assistance, except \n\n\n\n14\n\nin rare cases, seldom require assistance. The really valuable \nmen of the race never do, except in cases of accident or sudden \nchange. Everyone has, of course, cases of individuals brought to \nhis own knowledge where temporary assistance can do genuine \ngood, and these he will not overlook. But the amount which can \nbe wisely given by the individual for individuals is necessarily \nlimited by his lack of knowledge of the circumstances connected \nwith each. He is the only true reformer who is as careful and as \nanxious not to aid the unworthy as he is to aid the worthy, and, \nperhaps, even more so, for in almsgiving more injury is probably \ndone by rewarding vice than by relieving virtue.\n\nThe rich man is thus almost restricted to following the exam-\nples of Peter Cooper, Enoch Pratt of Baltimore, Mr. Pratt of \nBrooklyn, Senator Stanford, and others, who know that the best \nmeans of benefiting the community is to place within its reach \nthe ladders upon which the aspiring can rise\u2014parks, and means \nof recreation, by which men are helped in body and mind; works \nof art, certain to give pleasure and improve the public taste; \nand public institutions of various kinds, which will improve the \ngeneral condition of the people; in this manner returning their \n\nThere is no mode of disposing  \nof surplus wealth creditable  \nto thoughtful and earnest men  \ninto whose hands it flows save  \nby using it year by year for  \nthe general good.\n\n\n\n15THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nsurplus wealth to the mass of their fellows in the forms best \ncalculated to do them lasting good.\n\nThus is the problem of Rich and Poor to be solved. The laws \nof accumulation will be left free; the laws of distribution free. \nIndividualism will continue, but the millionaire will be but a \ntrustee for the poor; entrusted for a season with a great part of \nthe increased wealth of the community, but administering it \nfor the community far better than it could or would have done \nfor itself. The best minds will thus have reached a stage in the \ndevelopment of the race in which it is clearly seen that there is \nno mode of disposing of surplus wealth creditable to thought-\nful and earnest men into whose hands it flows save by using it \nyear by year for the general good. This day already dawns. But \na little while, and although, without incurring the pity of their \nfellows, men may die sharers in great business enterprises from \nwhich their capital cannot be or has not been withdrawn, and \nis left chiefly at death for public uses, yet the man who dies \nleaving behind him millions of available wealth, which was his \nto administer during life, will pass away \u201cunwept, unhonored, \nand unsung,\u201d no matter to what uses he leaves the dross which \nhe cannot take with him. Of such as these the public verdict will \nthen be: \u201cThe man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\u201d\n \nSuch, in my opinion, is the true Gospel concerning Wealth, \nobedience to which is destined someday to solve the problem of \nthe Rich and the Poor, and to bring \u201cPeace on earth, among men \nGood Will.\u201d\n\n\n\n16\n\n     he reception given to the first \npaper upon this subject, to which our lamented friend, the  \nlate editor and proprietor of this Review, was pleased to give  \nthe first place in the June number, has been most encouraging \nto its author, as it would surely have been to the editor had  \nhe been spared, for he was most deeply interested in the subject. \nAs showing the unflagging attention which Mr. Rice bestowed \nupon his editorial duties, it may be permissible to tell that  \nthe manuscript reached him in the morning, and late in the \nevening of the same day he called to say that it pleased him so \nmuch that he had determined to publish it in the forthcoming \nnumber, instead of holding it for the succeeding issue, as  \nhad been intended. When urged to delay publication, that \nproper time might be given for revision, he declined. Had he \ncomplied, another than he, alas! would have had to stand \nsponsor for my thoughts. Only one short week, and our friend \nwas at rest; his warfare o\u2019er. He had played his part in life  \nwell; and yet how little is he, or is anyone, missed upon the \nmarch! The race presses slowly on as before; another rises  \nto take the vacant place; The North American Review shines on,  \na lamp still burning, to show the great army of humanity the \npitfalls which it must avoid in order to retain what has been \nalready conquered, and to light the paths which that army must \ntread on its way to future conquests. In the death of Mr. Rice  \n\n II. \nTHE BEST FIELDS FOR PHILANTHROPY\n\n\n\n17THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nwe have another proof that in the progress of humanity persons \nare little or nothing; the race is all.\n\n The Individual withers, and the world is more and more.\n\nAnd yet it is much to me that probably the last manuscript our \nfriend read, valued, and published was \u201cWealth.\u201d Perhaps your \nreaders will pardon me for recalling an incident connected with \nour last interview. Sitting in my library, Mr. Rice expressed \na wish to hear the author read his manuscript. I read and he \nlistened from beginning to end, making but one interruption. \nWhen the passage was read which stated that, of every thousand \ndollars spent today in so-called charity, probably nine hundred \nwas unwisely spent, he exclaimed, \u201cYes, nine hundred and fifty! \nMake it nine hundred and fifty!\u201d and it was so made. I cannot \npass without paying a tribute to Allen Thorndike Rice. That I \nknew him is one of the sources from which sweet remembrances \nspring at times, when free from the roar and bustle of life.\n\nWhile \u201cWealth\u201d has thus met a cordial reception upon this side \nof the Atlantic, it is natural that in the motherland it should \nhave attracted most attention, because the older civilization is at \npresent brought more clearly face to face with socialistic ques-\ntions. The contrast between the classes and the masses, between \nrich and poor, is not yet quite so sharp in this vast, fertile, and \ndeveloping continent, with less than twenty persons per square \nmile, as in crowded little Britain, with fifteen times that number \nand no territory unoccupied. Perhaps the Pall Mall Gazette in \nits issue of September 5 puts most pithily the objections that \nhave been raised to what the English have been pleased to call \nthe \u201cGospel of Wealth.\u201d It says:\n\nGreat fortunes, says Mr. Carnegie, are great blessings to \na community, because such and such things may be done \nwith them. Well, but they are also a great curse, for such \n\n\n\n18\n\nand such things are done with them. Mr. Carnegie\u2019s preach-\ning, in other words, is altogether vitiated by Mr. Benzon\u2019s \npractice. The \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d is killed by the acts.\n\nTo this the reply seems obvious: the gospel of Christianity is also \nkilled by the acts. The same objection that is urged against the \ngospel of wealth lies against the commandment \u201cThou shalt not \nsteal.\u201d It is no argument against a gospel that it is not lived up \nto; indeed, it is an argument in its favor, for a gospel must be \nhigher than the prevailing standard. It is no argument against \na law that it is broken: in that disobedience lies the reason for \nmaking and maintaining the law; the law which is never to be \nbroken is never required.\n\nUndoubtedly the most notable incident in regard to the \u201cGospel \nof Wealth\u201d is that it was fortunate enough to attract the attention \nof Mr. Gladstone, and brought forth the following note from him:\n\nI have asked Mr. Lloyd Bryce (North American Review) \nkindly to allow the republication in this country of the \nextremely interesting article on \u201cWealth,\u201d by Mr. Andrew \nCarnegie, which has just appeared in America.\n\nIt is no argument against a \ngospel that it is not lived up to; \nindeed, it is an argument in  \nits favor, for a gospel must be \nhigher than the prevailing \nstandard.\n\n\n\n19THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nThis resulted in the publication of the article in several newspa-\npers and periodicals, and an enterprising publisher issued it in \npamphlet form. It is now sold in Britain for a penny.\n\nAll this is most encouraging, proving, as it does, that society is \nalive to the great issue involved, and is in a receptive mood. Your \nrequest, Mr. Editor, that I should continue the subject and point \nout the best fields for the use of surplus wealth may be taken as \nfurther proof that whether the ideas promulgated are to be \nreceived or rejected, they are at least certain to obtain a hearing.\n\nBefore entering upon the question which you have proposed, \nit may be advantageous to restate the positions taken in the \nformer paper, for the benefit of those who may not have read \nit, or who cannot conveniently refer to it. It was assumed that \nthe present laws of competition, accumulation, and distribution \nare the best obtainable conditions; that through these the race \nreceives its most valuable fruits; and, therefore, that they should \nbe accepted and upheld. Under these it was held that great \nwealth must inevitably flow into the hands of the few excep-\ntional managers of men. The question then arose, What should \nthese do with their surplus wealth? and the \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d \ncontended that surplus wealth should be considered as a sacred \ntrust, to be administered during the lives of its owners, by them \nas trustees, for the best good of the community in which and \nfrom which it had been acquired.\n\nIt was pointed out that there were but three modes of disposing \nof surplus wealth, and two of these were held to be improper. \nFirst, it was held that to leave great fortunes to children did not \nprove true affection for them or interest in their genuine good, \nregarded either as individuals or as members of the state; that it \nwas not the welfare of the children, but the pride of the parents, \nwhich inspired enormous legacies, and that, looking to the usual \nresults of vast sums conferred upon children, the thoughtful \n\n\n\n20\n\nman must be forced to say, if the good of the child only were \nconsidered: \u201cI would as soon leave to my son a curse as to leave \nto him the almighty dollar.\u201d\n\nThe second mode open to men is to hoard their surplus wealth \nduring life, and leave it at death for public uses. It was pointed \nout that in many cases these bequests become merely monu-\nments of the testators\u2019 folly; that the amount of real good done \nby posthumous gifts was ridiculously disproportionate to the \nsums thus left. The recent decision upon Mr. Tilden\u2019s will, \nwhich is said to have been drawn by the ablest of lawyers, and \nthe partial failure of Mr. Williamson\u2019s purposes in regard to \nthe great technical school which that millionaire intended to \nestablish in Philadelphia, are lessons indeed for the rich who \nonly bequeath.\n\nThe aim of the first article was thus to lead up to the conclusion \nthat there is but one right mode of using enormous fortunes\u2014\nnamely, that the possessors from time to time during their own \nlives should so administer them as to promote the permanent \ngood of the communities from which they have been gathered. It \nwas held that public sentiment would soon say of one who died \npossessed of millions of available wealth which he might have \nadministered: \u201cThe man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\u201d\n \nThe purpose of this article is to present some of the best meth-\nods of performing this duty of administering surplus wealth for \nthe good of the people. The first requisite for a really good use \nof wealth by the millionaire who has accepted the gospel which \nproclaims him only a trustee of the surplus that comes to him, \nis to take care that the purpose for which he spends it shall not \nhave a degrading, pauperizing tendency upon its recipients, and \nthat his trust should be so administered as to stimulate the best \nand most aspiring poor of the community to further efforts for \ntheir own improvement. It is not the irreclaimably destitute, \n\n\n\n21THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nshiftless, and worthless that it is truly beneficial or truly benev-\nolent to attempt to reach and improve. For these there exists \nthe refuge provided by the city or the state, where they can be \nsheltered, fed, clothed, and kept in comfortable existence, and\u2014\nmost important of all\u2014where they can be isolated from the well \ndoing and industrious poor, who are liable to be demoralized \nby contact with these unfortunates. One man or woman who \nsucceeds in living comfortably by begging is more dangerous \nto society, and a greater obstacle to the progress of humanity, \nthan a score of wordy Socialists. The individual administrator of \nsurplus wealth has as his charge the industrious and ambitious; \nnot those who need everything done for them, but those who, \nbeing most anxious and able to help themselves, deserve and \nwill be benefited by help from others and the extension of their \nopportunities at the hands of the philanthropic rich.\n\nIt is ever to be remembered that one of the chief obstacles which \nthe philanthropist meets in his efforts to do real and permanent \ngood in this world is the practice of indiscriminate giving; and \nthe duty of the millionaire is to resolve to cease giving to objects \nthat are not proved clearly to his satisfaction to be deserving. He \nmust remember Mr. Rice\u2019s belief, that nine hundred and fifty \nout of every thousand dollars bestowed today upon so-called \ncharity had better be thrown into the sea. As far as my experience \nof the wealthy extends, it is unnecessary to urge them to give of \ntheir superabundance in charity so called. Greater good for the \nrace is to be achieved by inducing them to cease impulsive and \ninjurious giving. As a rule, the sins of millionaires in this respect \nare not those of omission, but of commission, because they will \nnot take time to think, and chiefly because it is much easier to \ngive than to refuse. Those who have surplus wealth give millions \nevery year which produce more evil than good, and which really \nretard the progress of the people, because most of the forms in \nvogue today for benefiting mankind only tend to spread among \nthe poor a spirit of dependence upon alms, when what is \n\n\n\n22\n\nessential for progress is that they should be inspired to depend \nupon their own exertions. The miser millionaire who hoards his \nwealth does less injury to society than the careless millionaire \nwho squanders his unwisely, even if he does so under cover  \nof the mantle of sacred charity. The man who gives to the \nindividual beggar commits a grave offence, but there are many \nsocieties and institutions soliciting alms which it is none the \nless injurious to the community to aid. These are as corrupting \nas individual beggars. Plutarch\u2019s Morals contains this lesson:  \n\u201cA beggar asking an alms of a Lacedaemonian, he said: \u2018Well, \nshould I give thee anything, thou wilt be the greater beggar, for \nhe that first gave thee money made thee idle, and is the cause  \nof this base and dishonorable way of living.\u2019\u201d As I know them, \nthere are few millionaires, very few indeed, who are clear of  \nthis sin of having made beggars.\n\nBearing in mind these considerations, let us endeavor to present \nsome of the best uses to which a millionaire can devote the \nsurplus of which he should regard himself as only the trustee.\n\nFIRST \u2014 Standing apart by itself there is the founding of a \nuniversity by men enormously rich, such men as must necessar-\nily be few in any country. Perhaps the greatest sum ever given \nby an individual for any purpose is the gift of Senator Stanford, \nwho undertakes to establish upon the Pacific coast, where he \namassed his enormous fortune, a complete university, which is \nsaid to involve the expenditure of ten millions of dollars, and \nupon which he may be expected to bestow twenty millions of his \nsurplus. He is to be envied. A thousand years hence some orator, \nspeaking his praise upon the then crowded shores of the Pacific, \nmay repeat Griffith\u2019s eulogy of Wolsey, \u201cIn bestowing he was \nmost princely: ever witness for him this great seat of learning.\u201d \nHere is a noble use of wealth.\n\n\n\n23THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nWe have many such institutions, Hopkins, Cornell, Packer, and \nothers, but most of these have only been bequeathed, and it is \nimpossible to extol any man greatly for simply leaving what he \ncannot take with him. Cooper, and Pratt, and Stanford, and \nothers of this class deserve credit and the admiration of their \nfellows as much for the time and the attention given during their \nlives, as for their expenditure, upon their respective monuments.\n\nWe cannot have the Pacific coast in mind without recalling \nanother important work of a different character which has \nrecently been established there, the Lick Observatory. If any \nmillionaire be interested in the ennobling study of astronomy\u2014\nand there should be and would be such if they but gave the \nsubject the slightest attention\u2014here is an example which could \nwell be followed, for the progress made in astronomical instru-\nments and appliances is so great and continuous that every few \nyears a new telescope might be judiciously given to one of the \nobservatories upon this continent, the last being always the \nlargest and the best, and certain to carry further and further the \nknowledge of the universe and of our relation to it here upon the \nearth. As one among many of the good deeds of the late Mr. \nThaw, of Pittsburgh, his constant support of the observatory \nthere may be mentioned. This observatory enabled Professor \nLangley to make his wonderful discoveries. The professor is now \nat the head of the Smithsonian Institution, a worthy successor to \nProfessor Henry. Connected with him was Mr. Brashear, of \nPittsburgh, whose instruments are in most of the principal \nobservatories of the world. He was a common millwright, but \nMr. Thaw recognized his genius and was his main support \nthrough trying days. This common workman has been made a \nprofessor by one of the foremost scientific bodies of the world. In \napplying part of his surplus in aiding these two now famous men, \nthe millionaire Thaw did a noble work. Their joint labors have \n\n\n\n24\n\nbrought great, and are destined to bring still greater, credit upon \ntheir country in every scientific center throughout the world.\n\nIt is reserved for very few to found universities, and, indeed, \nthe use for many, or perhaps any, new universities does not \nexist. More good is henceforth to be accomplished by adding \nto and extending those in existence. But in this department a \nwide field remains for the millionaire as distinguished from the \nCroesus among millionaires. The gifts to Yale University have \nbeen many, but there is plenty of room for others. The School of \nFine Arts, founded by Mr. Street, the Sheffield Scientific School, \nendowed by Mr. Sheffield, and Professor Loomis\u2019s fund for the \nobservatory, are fine examples. Mrs. C. J. Osborne\u2019s building for \nreading and recitation is to be regarded with especial pleasure \nas being the wise gift of a woman. Harvard University has not \nbeen forgotten; the Peabody Museum, and the halls of Wells, \nMatthews, and Thayer may be cited. Sever Hall is worthy  \nof special mention, as showing what a genius like Richardson \ncould do with the small sum of a hundred thousand dollars. \nThe Vanderbilt University at Nashville, Tennessee, may be \nmentioned as a true product of the gospel of wealth. It was \nestablished by members of the Vanderbilt family during their \nlives\u2014mark this vital feature\u2014during their lives; for nothing \ncounts for much that is left by a man at his death. Such funds \nare torn from him, not given by him. If any millionaire is at  \na loss to know how to accomplish great and indisputable good \nwith his surplus, here is a field which can never be fully  \noccupied, for the wants of our universities increase with the \ndevelopment of the country.\n\nSECOND \u2014 The result of my own study of the question, What \nis the best gift which can be given to a community? is that a free \nlibrary occupies the first place, provided the community will \naccept and maintain it as a public institution, as much a part of \nthe city property as its public schools, and, indeed, an adjunct \n\n\n\n25THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nto these. It is, no doubt, possible that my own personal expe-\nrience may have led me to value a free library beyond all other \nforms of beneficence. When I was a boy in Pittsburgh, Colonel \nAnderson, of Allegheny\u2014a name I can never speak without \nfeelings of devotional gratitude\u2014opened his little library of four \nhundred books to boys. Every Saturday afternoon he was in \nattendance himself at his house to exchange books. No one but \nhe who has felt it can know the intense longing with which the \narrival of Saturday was awaited, that a new book might be had. \nMy brother and Mr. Phipps, who have been my principal busi-\nness partners through life, shared with me Colonel Anderson\u2019s \nprecious generosity, and it was when reveling in these treasures \nthat I resolved, if ever wealth came to me, that it should be used \nto establish free libraries, that other poor boys might receive \nopportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to \nthat noble man.\n\nGreat Britain has been foremost in appreciating the value of free \nlibraries for its people. Parliament passed an act permitting \ntowns and cities to establish and maintain these as municipal \ninstitutions, and whenever the people of any town or city voted \nto accept the provisions of the act, the authorities were authorized \nto tax the community to the extent of one penny in the pound \n\nThe result of my own study of the question, \nWhat is the best gift which can be given  \nto a community? is that a free library occupies \nthe first place\u2026. It is, no doubt, possible  \nthat my own personal experience may have  \nled me to value a free library beyond all  \nother forms of beneficence.\n\n\n\n26\n\nvaluation. Most of the towns already have free libraries under \nthis act. Many of these are the gifts of rich men, whose funds \nhave been used for the building, and in some cases for the books \nalso, the communities being required to maintain and to develop \nthe libraries; and to this feature I attribute most of their useful-\nness. An endowed institution is liable to become the prey of a \nclique. The public ceases to take interest in it, or, rather, never \nacquires interest in it. The rule has been violated which requires \nthe recipients to help themselves. Everything has been done for \nthe community instead of its being only helped to help itself.\n\nMany free libraries have been established in our country, but \nnone that I know of with such wisdom as the Pratt Library, \nof Baltimore. Mr. Pratt presented to the city of Baltimore \none million dollars, requiring it to pay 5 percent, per annum, \namounting to fifty thousand dollars per year, which is to be \ndevoted to the maintenance and development of the library and \nits branches. During last year 430,217 books were distributed; \n37,196 people of Baltimore are registered upon the books as \nreaders; and it is safe to say that the 37,000 frequenters of the \nPratt Library are of more value to Baltimore, to the State, and \nto the country than all the inert, lazy, and hopelessly poor in the \nwhole nation. And it may further be safely said that, by placing \nwithin the reach of 37,000 aspiring people books which they \nwere anxious to obtain, Mr. Pratt has done more for the genuine \nprogress of the people than has been done by all the contribu-\ntions of all the millionaires and rich people to help those who \ncannot help themselves. The one wise administrator of his \nsurplus has poured his fertilizing stream upon soil that was \nready to receive it and return a hundred-fold. The many squan-\nderers have not only poured their streams into sieves which \nnever can be filled\u2014they have done worse; they have poured \nthem into stagnant sewers that breed the diseases which afflict \nthe body politic. And this is not all. The million dollars of which \nMr. Pratt has made so grand a use are something, but there \n\n\n\n27THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nis something greater still. When the fifth branch library was \nopened in Baltimore, the speaker said:\n\nWhatever may have been done in these four years, it was  \nhis pleasure to acknowledge that much, very much, was  \ndue to the earnest interest, the wise councils, and the \npractical suggestions of Mr. Pratt. He never seemed to feel \nthat the mere donation of great wealth for the benefit of  \nhis fellow citizens was all that would be asked of him, but  \nhe wisely labored to make its application as comprehensive \nand effective as possible. Thus he constantly lightened \nburdens that were, at times, very heavy, brought good cheer \nand bright sunshine when clouds flitted across the sky,  \nand made every officer and employee feel that good work \nwas appreciated, and loyal devotion to duty would receive  \nhearty commendation.\n\nThis is the finest picture I have ever seen of any of the million-\naire class. As here depicted, Mr. Pratt is the ideal disciple of the \n\u201cGospel of Wealth.\u201d We need have no fear that the mass of toil-\ners will fail to recognize in such as he their best leaders and their \nmost invaluable allies; for the problem of poverty and wealth, of \nemployer and employed, will be practically solved whenever the \ntime of the few is given, and their wealth is administered during \ntheir lives, for the best good of that portion of the community \nwhich has not been burdened by the responsibilities which \nattend the possession of wealth. We shall have no antagonism \nbetween classes when that day comes, for the high and the low, \nthe rich and the poor, shall then indeed be brothers.\n\nNo millionaire will go far wrong in his search for one of the \nbest forms for the use of his surplus who chooses to establish \na free library in any community that is willing to maintain and \ndevelop it. John Bright\u2019s words should ring in his ear: \u201cIt is \nimpossible for any man to bestow a greater benefit upon a young \nman than to give him access to books in a free library.\u201d Closely \n\n\n\n28\n\nallied to the library, and, where possible, attached to it, there \nshould be rooms for an art gallery and museum, and a hall for \nsuch lectures and instruction as are provided in the Cooper \nUnion. The traveler upon the Continent is surprised to find that \nevery town of importance has its art gallery and museum; these \nmay be large or small, but in any case each has a receptacle \nfor the treasures of the locality, which is constantly receiving \nvaluable gifts and bequests. The free library and art gallery \nof Birmingham are remarkable among these, and every now \nand then a rich man adds to their value by presenting books, \nfine pictures, or other works of art. All that our cities require \nto begin with is a proper fireproof building. Their citizens who \ntravel will send to it rare and costly things from every quarter of \nthe globe they visit, while those who remain at home will give \nor bequeath to it of their treasures. In this way these collec-\ntions will grow until our cities will ultimately be able to boast of \npermanent exhibitions from which their own citizens will derive \nincalculable benefit, and which they will be proud to show to \nvisitors. In The Metropolitan Museum of Art in this city we have \nmade an excellent beginning. Here is another avenue for the \nproper use of surplus wealth.\n \nTHIRD \u2014 We have another most important department in which \ngreat sums can be worthily used\u2014the founding or extension of \nhospitals, medical colleges, laboratories, and other institutions \nconnected with the alleviation of human suffering, and especially \nwith the prevention rather than the cure of human ills. There is \nno danger of pauperizing a community in giving for such \npurposes, because such institutions relieve temporary ailments \nor shelter only those who are hopeless invalids. What better gift \nthan a hospital can be given to a community that is without \none?\u2014the gift being conditioned upon its proper maintenance by \nthe community in its corporate capacity. If hospital accommoda-\ntion already exists, no better method for using surplus wealth \ncan be found than in making additions to it. The late Mr. \n\n\n\n29THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nVanderbilt\u2019s gift of half a million of dollars to the medical \ndepartment of Columbia College for a chemical laboratory was \none of the wisest possible uses of wealth. It strikes at the preven-\ntion of disease by penetrating into its causes. Several others have \nestablished such laboratories, but the need for them is still great.\n\nIf there be a millionaire in the land who is at a loss what to do \nwith the surplus that has been committed to him as trustee, let \nhim investigate the good that is flowing from these chemical \nlaboratories. No medical college is complete without its labora-\ntory. As with universities, so with medical colleges; it is not new \ninstitutions that are required, but additional means for the more \nthorough equipment of those that exist. The forms that benefac-\ntions to these may wisely take are numerous, but probably none \nis more useful than that adopted by Mr. Osborn when he built a \nschool for training female nurses at Bellevue College. If from all \ngifts there flows one half of the good that comes from this wise \nuse of a millionaire\u2019s surplus, the most exacting may well be \nsatisfied. Only those who have passed through a lingering and \ndangerous illness can rate at their true value the care, skill, and \nattendance of trained female nurses. Their employment as nurses \nhas enlarged the sphere and influence of woman. It is not to be \nwondered at that a Senator of the United States and a physician \ndistinguished in this country for having received the highest \ndistinctions abroad should find their wives from this class.\n\nFOURTH \u2014 In the very front rank of benefactions public parks \nshould be placed, always provided that the community under-\ntakes to maintain, beautify, and preserve inviolate the parks \ngiven to it. No more useful or more beautiful monument can be \nleft by any man than a park for the city in which he was born \nor in which he has long lived, nor can the community pay a \nmore graceful tribute to the citizen who presents it than to give \nhis name to the gift. If a park be already provided, there is still \nroom for many judicious gifts in connection with it. Mr. Phipps, \n\n\n\n30\n\nof Allegheny, has given conservatories to the park there, which \nare visited by many every day of the week and crowded by thou-\nsands of working people every Sunday, for, with rare wisdom, \nhe has stipulated as a condition of the gift that the conservato-\nries shall be open on Sundays. The result of his experiment has \nbeen so gratifying that he is justified in adding to them from his \nsurplus, as he is doing largely this year. To any lover of flowers \namong the wealthy I commend a study of what is possible for \nthem to do in the line of Mr. Phipps\u2019s example; and may they \nplease note that Mr. Phipps is a wise as well as a liberal giver, \nfor he requires the city to maintain these conservatories, and \nthus secures for them forever the public ownership, the public \ninterest, and the public criticism of their management. Had he \nundertaken to manage and maintain them, it is probable that \npopular interest in the gift would never have been awakened.\n\nThe parks and pleasure grounds of small towns throughout \nEurope are not less surprising than their libraries, museums, \nand art galleries. We saw nothing more pleasing during our \nrecent travels than the hillside of Bergen, in Norway. It has been \nconverted into one of the most picturesque of pleasure grounds; \nfountains, cascades, waterfalls, delightful arbors, fine terraces, \nand statues adorn what was before a barren mountainside.  \nHere is a field worthy of study by the millionaire who would \nconfer a lasting benefit upon his fellows. Another beautiful \ninstance of the right use of wealth in the direction of making \ncities more and more attractive we found in Dresden. The owner \nof the leading paper there bequeathed its revenues forever to \nthe city, to be used in beautifying it. An art committee decides \nfrom time to time what new artistic feature is to be introduced \nor what hideous feature is to be changed, and as the revenues \naccrue they are expended in this direction. Thus through the gift \nof this patriotic newspaper proprietor his native city of Dresden \nis fast becoming one of the most artistic places of residence in \nthe whole world. A work having been completed, it devolves \n\n\n\n31THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nupon the city to maintain it forever. May I be excused if I \ncommend to our millionaire newspaper proprietors the example \nof their colleague in the capital of Saxony?\n\nScarcely a city of any magnitude in the older countries is without \nmany structures and features of great beauty. Much has been \nspent upon ornament, decoration, and architectural effect: we \nare still far behind in these things upon this side of the Atlantic. \nOur Republic is great in some things\u2014in material development \nunrivaled; but let us always remember that in art and in the \nfiner touches we have scarcely yet taken a place. Had the exqui-\nsite memorial arch recently erected temporarily in New York \nbeen shown in Dresden, the art committee there would probably \nhave been enabled, from the revenue of the newspaper given by \nits owner for just such purposes, to order its permanent erection \nto adorn the city forever.\n\nWhile the bestowal of a park upon a community as one of the \nbest uses for surplus wealth will be universally approved, in \nembracing such additions to it as conservatories, or in advocat-\ning the building of memorial arches and works of adornment, \nit is probable that many will think we go too far, and consider \nthese somewhat fanciful. The material good to flow from them \nmay not be so directly visible; but let not any practical mind, \nintent only upon material good, depreciate the value of wealth \ngiven for these or for kindred aesthetic purposes as being \nuseless as far as the mass of the people and their needs are \nconcerned. As with libraries and museums, so with these more \ndistinctively artistic works; these perform their great use when \nthey reach the best of the masses of the people. It is worth more \nto reach and touch the sentiment for beauty in the naturally \nbright minds of this class than that those incapable of being so \ntouched should be pandered to. For what the improver of the \nrace must endeavor to do is to reach those who have the divine \nspark ever so feebly developed, that it may be strengthened and \n\n\n\n32\n\ngrow. For my part, I think Mr. Phipps put his money to better \nuse in giving the workingmen of Allegheny conservatories filled \nwith beautiful flowers, orchids, and aquatic plants, which they, \nwith their wives and children, can enjoy in their spare hours, \nand on which they can feed the love for the beautiful, than if he \nhad given his surplus money to furnish them with bread, for \nthose in health who cannot earn their bread are scarcely worth \nconsidering by the individual giver; the care of such being the \nduty of the state. The man who erects in a city a truly artistic \narch, statue, or fountain makes a wise use of his surplus. \u201cMan \ndoes not live by bread alone.\u201d\n\nFIFTH \u2014 We have another good use for surplus wealth, in \nproviding for our cities halls suitable for meetings of all kinds, \nespecially for concerts of elevating music. Our cities are rarely \nprovided with halls for these purposes, being in this respect \nalso very far behind European cities. The Springer Hall, of \nCincinnati, that valuable addition to the city, was largely the gift \nof Mr. Springer, who was not content to bequeath funds from \nhis estate at death, but who gave during his life, and, in addition, \ngave\u2014what was equally important\u2014his time and business abil-\nity to ensure the successful results which have been achieved. \nThe gift of a hall to any city lacking one is an excellent use for \nsurplus wealth for the good of a community. The reason why the \npeople have only one instructive and elevating, or even amus-\ning, entertainment when a dozen would be highly beneficial, is \nthat the rent of a hall, even when a suitable hall exists (which is \nrare), is so great as to prevent managers from running the risk \nof financial failure. If every city in our land owned a hall which \ncould be given or rented for a small sum for such gatherings as \na committee or the mayor of the city judged advantageous, the \npeople could be furnished with proper lectures, amusements, \nand concerts at an exceedingly small cost. The town halls of \nEuropean cities, many of which have organs, are of inestimable \nvalue to the people, when utilized as they are in the manner \n\n\n\n33THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nsuggested. Let no one underrate the influence of entertainments \nof an elevating or even of an amusing character, for these do \nmuch to make the lives of the people happier and their natures \nbetter. If any millionaire born in a small village, which has now \nbecome a great city, is prompted in the day of his success to do \nsomething for his birthplace with part of his surplus, his grateful \nremembrance cannot take a form more useful than that of a \npublic hall with an organ, provided the city agrees to maintain \nand use it.\n\nSIXTH \u2014 In another respect we are still much behind Europe. A \nform of beneficence which is not uncommon there is providing \nswimming baths for the people. The donors of these have been \nwise enough to require the city benefited to maintain them at \nits own expense, and as proof of the contention that everything \nshould never be done for anyone or for any community, but \nthat the recipients should invariably be called upon to do part, \nit is significant that it is found essential for the popular success \nof these healthful establishments to exact a nominal charge for \ntheir use. In many cities, however, the schoolchildren are admit-\nted free at fixed hours upon certain days, different hours being \nfixed for the boys and the girls to use the great swimming baths, \nhours or days being also fixed for the use of these baths by \nladies. In inland cities the young of both sexes are thus taught to \nswim. Swimming clubs are organized, and matches are frequent, \nat which medals and prizes are given. The reports published by \nthe various swimming baths throughout Great Britain are filled \nwith instances of lives saved because those who fortunately \nescaped shipwreck had been taught to swim in the baths, and \nnot a few instances are given in which the pupils of certain bath-\ning establishments have saved the lives of others. If any disciple \nof the \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d gives his favorite city large swimming \nand private baths (provided the municipality undertakes their \nmanagement as a city affair), he will never be called to account \nfor an improper use of the funds entrusted to him.\n\n\n\n34\n\nSEVENTH \u2014 Churches as fields for the use of surplus wealth \nhave purposely been reserved until the last, because, these \nbeing sectarian, every man will be governed by his own attach-\nments; therefore gifts to churches, it may be said, are not, in \none sense, gifts to the community at large, but to special classes. \nNevertheless, every millionaire may know of a district where the \nlittle cheap, uncomfortable, and altogether unworthy wooden \nstructure stands at the crossroads, to which the whole neighbor-\nhood gathers on Sunday, and which is the center of social life \nand source of neighborly feeling. The administrator of wealth \nhas made a good use of part of his surplus if he replaces that \nbuilding with a permanent structure of brick, stone, or gran-\nite, up the sides of which the honeysuckle and columbine may \nclimb, and from whose tower the sweet-tolling bell may sound. \nThe millionaire should not figure how cheaply this structure can \nbe built, but how perfect it can be made. If he has the money, \nit should be made a gem, for the educating influence of a pure \nand noble specimen of architecture, built, as the pyramids were \nbuilt, to stand for ages, is not to be measured by dollars. Every \nfarmer\u2019s home, heart, and mind in the district will be influenced \nby the beauty and grandeur of the church. But having given the \nbuilding, the donor should stop there; the support of the church \nshould be upon its own people; there is not much genuine reli-\ngion in the congregation or much good to flow from the church \nwhich is not supported at home.\n\nMany other avenues for the wise expenditure of surplus wealth \nmight be indicated. I enumerate but a few\u2014a very few\u2014of the \nmany fields which are open, and only those in which great or \nconsiderable sums can be judiciously used. It is not the privi-\nlege, however, of millionaires alone to work for or aid measures \nwhich are certain to benefit the community. Everyone who has \nbut a small surplus above his moderate wants may share this \nprivilege with his richer brothers, and those without surplus can \ngive at least part of their time, which is usually as important as \n\n\n\n35THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nfunds, and often more so. Someday, perhaps, with your permis-\nsion, I will endeavor to point out some fields and modes in \nwhich these may perform well their part as trustees of wealth or \nleisure, according to the measure of their respective fortunes.\n\nIt is not expected, neither is it desirable, that there should be \na general concurrence as to the best possible use of surplus \nwealth. For different men and different localities there are \ndifferent uses. What commends itself most highly to the judg-\nment of the administrator is the best use for him, for his heart \nshould be in the work. It is as important in administering wealth \nas it is in any other branch of a man\u2019s work that he should be \nenthusiastically devoted to it and feel that in the field selected \nhis work lies.\n\nBesides this, there is room and need for all kinds of wise bene-\nfactions for the commonweal. The man who builds a univer-\nsity, library, or laboratory performs no more useful work than \nhe who elects to devote himself and his surplus means to the \nadornment of a park, the gathering together of a collection of \npictures for the public, or the building of a memorial arch. These \nare all true laborers in the vineyard. The only point required by \n\nIt is not the privilege, however, of millionaires \nalone to work for or aid measures which are \ncertain to benefit the community. Everyone who \nhas but a small surplus above his moderate \nwants may share this privilege with his richer \nbrothers, and those without surplus can give \nat least part of their time, which is usually as \nimportant as funds, and often more so.\n\n\n\n36\n\nthe \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d is that the surplus which accrues from \ntime to time in the hands of a man should be administered by \nhim in his own lifetime for that purpose which is seen by him,  \nas trustee, to be best for the good of the people. To leave at \ndeath what he cannot take away, and place upon others the \nburden of the work which it was his own duty to perform, is to \ndo nothing worthy. This requires no sacrifice, nor any sense of \nduty to his fellows.\n\nTime was when the words concerning the rich man entering \nheaven were regarded as a hard saying. Today, when all  \nquestions are probed to the bottom and the standards of faith \nreceive the most liberal interpretations, the startling verse has \nbeen relegated to the rear, to await the next kindly revision as \none of those things which cannot be quite understood, but \nwhich meanwhile\u2014it is carefully to be observed\u2014are not to be \nunderstood literally. But is it so very improbable that the next \nstage of thought is not to restore the doctrine in all its pristine \npurity and force, as being in perfect harmony with sound ideas \nupon the subject of wealth and poverty, the rich and the poor, \nand the contrasts everywhere seen and deplored? In Christ\u2019s \nday, it is evident, reformers were against the wealthy. It is none \nthe less evident that we are fast recurring to that position today; \nand there will be nothing to surprise the student of sociological \ndevelopment if society should soon approve the text which has \n\nThe only point required by the \u201cGospel of \nWealth\u201d is that the surplus which accrues from \ntime to time in the hands of a man should be \nadministered by him in his own lifetime for  \nthat purpose which is seen by him, as trustee,  \nto be best for the good of the people.\n\n\n\n37THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\ncaused so much anxiety: \u201cIt is easier for a camel to enter the  \neye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of \nHeaven.\u201d Even if the needle were the small casement at the \ngates, the words betoken serious difficulty for the rich. It will be \nbut a step for the theologian to take from the doctrine that he \nwho dies rich dies disgraced to that which brings upon the man \npunishment or deprivation hereafter.\n\nThe \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d but echoes Christ\u2019s words. It calls upon \nthe millionaire to sell all that he hath and give it in the highest \nand best form to the poor, by administering his estate himself \nfor the good of his fellows, before he is called upon to lie down \nand rest upon the bosom of Mother Earth. So doing, he will \napproach his end no longer the ignoble hoarder of useless \nmillions, poor, very poor indeed, in money, but rich, very rich, \ntwenty times a millionaire still, in the affection, gratitude,  \nand admiration of his fellow men, and\u2014sweeter far\u2014soothed \nand sustained by the still small voice within, which, whispering, \ntells him that, because he has lived, perhaps one small part  \nof the great world has been bettered just a little. This much is \nsure: against such riches as these no bar will be found at the \nGates of Paradise.\n\n\n\n38\n\nABOUT ANDREW CARNEGIE\n\nBorn in Dunfermline, Scotland, on November 25, 1835, Andrew Carnegie \nwas the first son of Margaret and William Carnegie, a linen weaver and \nlocal leader of the Chartists (who sought to improve the conditions of work-\ning-class life in Great Britain).\n\nThe Carnegie family immigrated to the United States in 1848, settling in \nAllegheny, Pennsylvania. There, at the age of thirteen, Andrew began his \ncareer as a bobbin boy in a cotton factory. A voracious reader who could \nnot afford books in his native Scotland, Carnegie took advantage of the \ngenerosity of an Allegheny citizen who opened his library to local working \nboys. Books provided most of his education as he moved from factory  \nboy to telegraph operator, and then on to a series of positions leading to \nthat of superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nWhile still employed by the railroad\nThe file is too long and its contents have been truncated.\n", "title": "gospel_of_wealth_2017.pdf", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2081c-7c77-4e06-abe7-ddfb9738dcbe", "request_id": "87dd38b4accc4bde-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2081c-7c77-4e06-abe7-ddfb9738dcbe", "children": ["88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70"]}, "88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70": {"id": "88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70", "message": {"id": "88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714707566.926264, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\nPlease remember to search the user&#x27;s documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "c1ab741b-88de-4cb6-9c5f-36ce6261ab34", "request_id": "87dd38b4accc4bde-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c1ab741b-88de-4cb6-9c5f-36ce6261ab34", "children": ["cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf"]}, "cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf": {"id": "cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf", "message": {"id": "cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714707566.926455, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["### Outline of &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot;\n\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Overview of the changing conditions of society and the disparities between the rich and poor.\n   - Acknowledgment of the benefits and challenges brought by the accumulation of wealth.\n\n2. **The Responsibilities of Wealth**\n   - Argument that the wealthy are trustees of their riches and should live modestly and use their wealth for the public good.\n   - Critique of those who accumulate wealth only to leave it behind upon death.\n\n3. **Methods of Wealth Distribution**\n   - Criticism of handing down wealth to descendants and the negative impact it can have.\n   - The importance of actively managing wealth to contribute to societal progress during one\u2019s lifetime.\n\n4. **Practical Applications of Wealth**\n   - Examples of effective ways to use wealth, such as funding public parks, libraries, universities, and scientific research.\n   - Encouragement for the wealthy to engage directly in philanthropy and societal improvement.\n\n5. **Conclusion**\n   - Recapitulation of the main thesis: the wealthy must use their fortunes to bridge societal gaps and foster community health.\n\n### Summary\n\nAndrew Carnegie&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot; is a seminal text that outlines his philosophy on the duties of the wealthy, arguing that individuals who accumulate wealth have the responsibility to use it for the greater good of society. He contends that wealth should not simply be inherited by the progeny of the rich nor should it be hoarded until death, but rather actively managed and distributed by the wealthy during their lifetimes.\n\nCarnegie challenges the wealthy to act as stewards of their wealth, using it to promote societal progress and innovation. He proposes practical means through which wealth can be beneficially used, including the establishment of public institutions such as libraries, parks, universities, and research facilities that can provide lasting benefits to communities.\n\n### Key Ideas\n\n- **Trusteeship of Wealth**: Carnegie believes that the rich are merely trustees of their wealth and should use it to promote the general welfare.\n- **Active Philanthropy**: He advocates for a proactive approach to wealth distribution, where the wealthy take an active role in philanthropy rather than merely leaving an inheritance.\n- **Social Benefits**: Carnegie emphasizes the social benefits of wealth distribution, arguing that it can lead to a more equitable and advanced society.\n- **Legacy of Giving**: He encourages the wealthy to leave a legacy of giving that continues to benefit society long after they are gone.\n\n### Relevance to Sustainable Resource Management\n\nCarnegie\u2019s ideas are relevant to sustainable resource management in that they promote the use of surplus wealth for the development of public goods that can lead to sustainable outcomes. His advocacy for the creation of parks, libraries, and universities supports the idea of sustainable communities where resources are used to create lasting social and environmental benefits. The principles he outlines can be applied to modern sustainable practices by encouraging those with the means to invest in renewable resources, conservation efforts, and sustainable technologies, thus ensuring that their wealth contributes to long-term societal resilience and ecological balance."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-V2KIUZSj0", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70", "request_id": "87dd38b4accc4bde-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70", "children": ["aaa2f400-8735-458d-96b4-34d87066a4f2"]}, "aaa2f400-8735-458d-96b4-34d87066a4f2": {"id": "aaa2f400-8735-458d-96b4-34d87066a4f2", "message": {"id": "aaa2f400-8735-458d-96b4-34d87066a4f2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714710527.231114, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [" Select two of Carnegie\u2019s arguments in the piece and analyze how they relate (or do not relate) to philanthropy today.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87dd8198efe84bf1-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf", "children": ["2373c534-d65b-474c-a72d-08628a06015f"]}, "2373c534-d65b-474c-a72d-08628a06015f": {"id": "2373c534-d65b-474c-a72d-08628a06015f", "message": {"id": "2373c534-d65b-474c-a72d-08628a06015f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714710560.398024, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Andrew Carnegie\u2019s &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot; offers several compelling arguments about the responsibilities of the wealthy towards society, many of which continue to resonate in today\u2019s philanthropic landscape. Two particularly relevant arguments are the concept of wealth as a trust and the critique of bequeathing vast fortunes to descendants.\n\n### 1. Wealth as a Trust\n\n**Carnegie\u2019s Argument:**\nCarnegie argues that the wealthy are merely trustees of their wealth and have the duty to administer it in a way that benefits society. This involves living modestly, providing moderately for one\u2019s dependents, and using the bulk of one&#x27;s resources to address public issues.\n\n**Relation to Modern Philanthropy:**\nThis concept closely aligns with the modern idea of &quot;impact investing&quot; and &quot;strategic philanthropy,&quot; where donors seek to use their wealth to generate specific social or environmental benefits alongside a financial return. Today\u2019s philanthropists, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, explicitly view their wealth as a means to solve global issues, evident in their support for initiatives through the Giving Pledge, where billionaires commit to donating the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes. This reflects Carnegie&#x27;s belief in wealth as a trust for public benefit, demonstrating a continued commitment among many in the elite to manage their wealth responsibly for societal improvement.\n\n### 2. Critique of Bequeathing Wealth to Descendants\n\n**Carnegie\u2019s Argument:**\nCarnegie criticizes the practice of leaving immense wealth to children, suggesting it often does more harm than good. He argues that such inheritances can stifle personal development and lead to a class of idle rich. Instead, he advocates for the use of wealth during one\u2019s lifetime to support public works that provide long-term benefits to society.\n\n**Relation to Modern Philanthropy:**\nWhile some modern wealthy individuals still pass on significant assets to their heirs, there is a growing movement towards limiting such inheritances, as exemplified by the Giving Pledge. Philanthropists today are increasingly concerned about the societal impacts of their wealth and are choosing to allocate their resources to philanthropic funds, foundations, and trusts that address societal issues, rather than to personal fortunes for their descendants. This shift reflects Carnegie\u2019s perspective on the potentially deleterious effects of large inheritances and supports a broader societal trend towards equity and meritocracy.\n\n### Analysis\nCarnegie\u2019s arguments about the trusteeship of wealth and the careful consideration against bequeathing fortunes to descendants have profoundly influenced contemporary views on philanthropy. His advocacy for active, thoughtful philanthropy has laid the groundwork for modern practices that prioritize strategic, impactful giving over mere wealth accumulation or dynastic wealth transfer. However, the degree to which these principles are adopted varies, with some modern billionaires still favoring substantial inheritances over public giving.

To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

Many libraries also offer digital lending services.\n\n2. **Open Educational Resources (OER)**: These are freely accessible and openly licensed text, media, and other digital assets useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes. Websites like OER Commons provide access to a range of textbooks and educational materials.\n\n3. **Online Platforms**: Some websites like Project Gutenberg offer free ebooks, mainly for literature and other public domain works.\n\n4. **Book Swaps or Sharing**: Sometimes other students in your school might be willing to lend or sell their textbooks at a much lower price. Check student forums, bulletin boards, and social media groups for your university.\n\n5. **Publishers&#x27; Websites**: Some publishers might offer a free PDF download or a low-cost version of the textbook for students. It&#x27;s worth checking the official website of the textbook&#x27;s publisher.\n\n6. **Academic Databases**: Your university might have subscriptions to academic databases that include access to books, journal articles, and other scholarly resources.\n\nAlways make sure to respect copyright laws and the authors\u2019 rights when sourcing your textbooks."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "aaa22fd0-c5e2-4dc4-afd4-69bc4c8589da", "request_id": "87cba6cedbde4c50-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa22fd0-c5e2-4dc4-afd4-69bc4c8589da", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "02a51162-0f49-4ef3-9bab-6c88704216fe", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "0c64aa3d-9e44-4063-8e05-148090fe87c5", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "0c64aa3d-9e44-4063-8e05-148090fe87c5"}, {"title": "Daffy&#x27;s Sly Stork Surprise", "create_time": 1714200468.315823, "update_time": 1714202299.581448, "mapping": {"cdc068e5-53c4-4c50-b761-bbe04d96e764": {"id": "cdc068e5-53c4-4c50-b761-bbe04d96e764", "message": {"id": "cdc068e5-53c4-4c50-b761-bbe04d96e764", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa1b985-4441-407b-90f4-46acf0d65c9b", "children": ["aaa2c37b-1f49-4f4e-8e82-c094dde4336d"]}, "aaa1b985-4441-407b-90f4-46acf0d65c9b": {"id": "aaa1b985-4441-407b-90f4-46acf0d65c9b", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["cdc068e5-53c4-4c50-b761-bbe04d96e764"]}, "aaa2c37b-1f49-4f4e-8e82-c094dde4336d": {"id": "aaa2c37b-1f49-4f4e-8e82-c094dde4336d", "message": {"id": "aaa2c37b-1f49-4f4e-8e82-c094dde4336d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714200468.32254, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I remember a looney tunes ep where daffy has kids in the end and he standing around looking like the cat who got the canary sly and happy with a bunch bad kids around.

You don\u2019t believe me? See what our employees think here.\n\nWhat\u2019s JLS Like?\nYou Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don\u2019t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you\u2019re not \u2013 you can just be you.\n\nMajor Opportunities for Career Growth. We don\u2019t want to settle for just being a small business \u2013 we plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done. If you\u2019re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We\u2019re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you\u2019re gonna like it here.\n\nStrongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it\u2019s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within a few weeks of getting hired (seriously).\n\nComplete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\nFull-Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.\n\nNo Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFlexible Work Hours. This doesn\u2019t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I\u2019m skeptical)? This is the place for you.\n\nSupportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard but is 100% happy to help you if you\u2019re running into trouble.\n\nNo Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can\u2019t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.\n\nLots of Raises (for People Who Kick Ass). We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don\u2019t have to ask for one. It\u2019s not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\nHealth Insurance. Get access to our (pretty darned good) health insurance from the day you start. Or if you\u2019re outside the US, then get reimbursed monthly for finding your own health insurance.\n\nNo Assholes Allowed. We try very, very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.\n\nRegular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Feedback is really, really important here. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don\u2019t bullshit \u2013 when you\u2019re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to improve. And when you\u2019re doing well, we do our best to tell you.\n\nWe\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want everyone in the company to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\nHow Much Will I Learn?\nSo, so much! We can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll learn more in your first 6 months than you did during your entire school career. We have literally thousands of internal training documents, and spend lots and lots of effort helping people learn new skills.\n\nIf you want a taste, then here is the founder\u2019s list of publicly available documents. There are another 1,500+ things only available to JLS folks, and we add 50+ new things per month on average.\n\nBasically, if learning is one of your priorities in an employer, then we are absolutely the place for you.\n\nWhat Is JLS\u2019s Mission?\nIn short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).\n\nWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re successful at achieving this goal when:\n\n1. We have the right people on the bus and they\u2019re in the right seats.\n\n2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.\n\n3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn\u2019t dream of working anywhere else.\n\n4. Our customers love us.\n\n5. We\u2019re having a ton of fun.\n\n6. We\u2019re making a ton of money.\n\nAll of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success. This business doesn\u2019t exist to make the founder rich, though that will hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of these things and won\u2019t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.\n\nWhat Are Your Values?\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly, so if you don\u2019t 100% agree with these, then we aren\u2019t the place for you. Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:\n\n\nDo You Have a Detailed Company Vision?\nCheck it out here.\n\nCan I See Some Interviews with Your People?\nFor sure. See JLS Employee Testimonials.\n\nWhy Is Your Website Ugly? You Do Realize It\u2019s Not 1999 Right?\nOK first off, ouch. I\u2019ll have you know that the founder\u2019s college roommate\u2019s teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.\n\nSecond, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate. I\u2019ll bet from this single page, you\u2019ll learn more about our company than the last 10 companies you looked at put together, even if your eyes bleed in the process!\n\nFurther, we don\u2019t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She\u2019s no fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of the Company?\nHere is a carefully-crafted, undoubtedly white-washed history of the enigma known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nCan You Share Employee Feedback from Your Annual Company Survey?\nSee some key results and direct feedback from current employees here (including their criticisms \u2013 we really mean it when we say there\u2019s no BS). Some responses have been removed for including personally identifiable information or if it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to share the feedback publicly, but otherwise, results are posted as-is. This is probably a very informative tool for hearing what real-life employees have to say about us.\n\nAre You Hiring?\nIf we are hiring, then you can see our active jobs here: Link.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any jobs that look right for you, don\u2019t worry. We are always looking to add smart and capable people to our team. You can fill out our General Application Form, and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out.\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to be informed when there is a new open position at JLS Trading Co., feel free to sign up for our Open Positions Newsletter and we will make sure to send you one of our highly trained messenger pigeons. Yes, pigeons! Have you looked at this website? What did you expect?\n\nCan I Work Remotely (Even World-Wide)?\nFor office/knowledge-work jobs: 100%. In fact, we want to be a remote-only company as much as reasonably possible, if only to save on rent because the CEO is cheap AF, but more so because working remotely is on-balance so much better for everyone involved. Imagine never having to commute or wear pants ever again!\n\nMost of our employees are in the USA, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way. We currently work with people in multiple US states, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Argentina, India, Mexico, and more (we\u2019re too lazy to update this list as we grow, FYI). We legitimately don\u2019t care where you live, as long as you\u2019re fucking awesome at your job (and really fucking nice).\n\nUnfortunately, the geo-flexibility and work from home does not apply to inventory/production-related jobs, where we have to have you on-site, since you have to physically interact with product. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wish there were some way to make it work.\n\nBut for computer work, we 100% encourage/demand that you do it at home. We\u2019ll buy you a laptop and give you money to get your home office set up, too.\n\nHow Many People Do You Have?\nHere is our live breakdown because we got tired of manually updating this page. As of Summer 2021, around 40% of our folks work in the warehouse getting things out the door, and the rest work remotely doing office/marketing/other stuff (like making sure the founder knows he\u2019s an idiot). Around 2/3 of our remote/office staff work outside the USA.\n\nAre You Fashion Forward?\nYou bet your ass:\n\n\nWhat Are the Hours Like?\nProduction/inventory jobs have stricter start times than others (it\u2019s the nature of the beast unfortunately), but almost all other jobs offer flexible hours. We don\u2019t care exactly when you work, so long as you get your work done. If you want to start at 7:00 AM, fantastic. If you want to start at 10:00 AM, by all means. If you want to go to the gym at 1:00 PM, good on you. If you want to go see your kid\u2019s T-Ball game, well\u2026 Bring beer because those are just awful.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re absolutely crushing it, we basically don\u2019t give a shit when you clock in or out (some jobs have tighter work windows though).\n\nIn our humble (but obviously right) opinion, there are three types of people:\n\n1. People who cannot possibly be effective regularly working 60+ hours per week\n\n2. Liars\n\n3. Cocaine addicts\n\nSo, for us, hourly full-time employees are expected to work a minimum of 38 hours per week and full-time salaried employees are expected to work around 40-45 hours per week. If you have to go over that number regularly, you\u2019re gonna get yelled at.\n\nIs There Opportunity for Advancement?\nOh man, is there ever. Our ambitions are limitless (see the vision for more details). We aren\u2019t just growing with GDP \u2013 we are trying to grow 100% a year for basically eternity, which categorically means that if you\u2019re smart and capable (like really smart and capable), then you will never want for more opportunities. Presuming you are damned good, then you will get as much opportunity and responsibility as you want (and maybe more than that).\n\nIf you want to advance probably 10x faster than a normal corporate job, we are the place for you.\n\nIs the Company Actually Growing Fast?\nYou Decide. Revenue by Year:\n\n2014 \u2013 $354k\n\n2015 \u2013 $1.35m\n\n2016 \u2013 $2.2m\n\n2017 \u2013 $3.3m\n\n2018 \u2013 $5.6m\n\n2019 \u2013 $9.7m\n\n2020 \u2013 $10.6 (2020 was\u2026interesting)\n\n2021 \u2013 $17.3m\n\n2022 \u2013 $19m\n\nWe share revenue numbers to increase the chances that high-quality people don\u2019t think that we\u2019re full of shit. All this growth means that there are lots and lots of opportunities for capable, ambitious people. Plus all financials are shared with all employees on a monthly basis so everyone knows exactly where the company is at \u2013 the No Bullshit value is just that: No Bullshit.\n\nWhere Do You Store Your Male Models?\nIn multiple locations around the warehouse:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Testimonials\nSee our reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google. And check out the survey results above for more direct feedback from employees.\n\nFrom John P:\n\nJLS has been the greatest place to work in my life. I love working here because I am challenged on a daily basis to do new and interesting things, I am given the freedom to figure out how to do those things, and I know that I can trust in my very reasonable and thoughtful management team. It\u2019s a new company with a lot of opportunities, in the sense that, we\u2019re always looking for a better way to do things, so as somebody that likes to think of new methods and test them out, I\u2019m very happy because I can try new things and new ways of doing things.\n\nFrom Ben W:\n\nI previously worked in corporate America and never had any idea how what I did impacted the company\u2019s success. Now, I am working in a company where everyone from the owner to the newest hire meets weekly to review individual and company successes, failures, and lessons learned. Knowing why what I do matters while working with smart people in a culture that pushes me to improve myself on a day to day basis has been a revelation, and I look forward to continuing to take part in the growth of the business for years to come.\n\nFrom Drew B:\n\nJLS has by far been the best place I have ever worked. My work/life balance has never been better, and everyone seems to genuinely care about my personal happiness. My job history has spanned a wide variety of businesses and industries. I have even run my own business. It wasn\u2019t until I came to JLS that I realized how important a good culture fit can be. We expect a lot out of each other, and we work hard at being a unified team.\n\nWhat Is Turnover Like?\nVoluntary turnover is super low. Like super, super low. The things that cause people to be asked to leave are:\n\n1. Values non-fit. We joke around a lot, but we take our values very seriously.\n\n2. They can\u2019t do the job. We are stringent that you have to kick ass. We will absolutely give you the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, but if you\u2019re not a smart mofo, then we\u2019re forced to act for the good of the group.\n\nHowever, because we\u2019re a high-feedback environment, you will absolutely know ahead of time what your boss thinks about your performance and what you need to do to improve.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t You on Social Media?\n1. The founder refuses to upgrade his mobile device from his TI-83 and LinkedIn stupidly hasn\u2019t released an app for it yet.\n\n2. Have you, like, ever been on social media? It\u2019s awful.\n\n3. We keep getting kicked off of Myspace for being \u201ctoo emo\u201d which honestly just makes us even more emo.\n\n4. We probably will at some point, but mostly we\u2019re just lazy.\n\nHow Many Meetings Are There?\nAs few as fucking possible. We do everything we can to encourage people to just email vs doing a quick chat or a meeting, so there are very, very few set meetings in the company. Amongst the worst feedback a manager can receive is that they regularly hold meetings that could have been an email. It\u2019s pretty nice to not have to sit through useless, bullshit meetings and just have to read the founder\u2019s useless, bullshit emails instead.\n\nWho Is JLS Not For?\nThis is a good question. JLS is probably not for you if you:\n\n\u2013 Want a stable job that doesn\u2019t change very often\n\n\u2013 Like the security that comes from working for a very large company\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy building things, and all that comes along with that\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t believe that everything can be optimized, for basically forever\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy discovering the truth through friendly back and forth discussion\n\n\u2013 Care about status\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like really considering other people\u2019s feelings before doing things\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like wearing multiple hats\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like dealing with ambiguity/the unknown\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like being in a place that is very careful about not wasting resources\n\n\u2013 Thrive in a political rather than a results-based environment\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy letting your guard down and just being yourself with your coworkers\n\nWe are definitely not for everyone. We are effectively a startup that is trying to be a giant company, which clearly has trade-offs, but if all of that isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you, then why not take a shot and apply?\n\nWhat Kind of Car Does the CEO Drive?\nWell first off, the CEO refuses to leave the house/put pants on, so there is some internal debate as to whether or not he actually exists.\n\nBut when he does leave the house, he drives his sexy AF 2004 Toyota 4Runner or his wife\u2019s 2008 Toyota Sienna, which is slightly less sexy but has so much room for activities. Probably don\u2019t ask him about the cars though, unless you want a 30-minute lecture on why high-mileage Toyotas are hands-down the best value on the planet.\n\nDo You Believe in Work-Life Balance?\nWork Life Balance at JLS Trading Co.\n\nThe above never happens at JLS \u2013 we instituted a rule saying you can\u2019t stab people in the head a long time ago. Sometimes we amaze ourselves at how generous we are.\n\nWork/Life Balance is one of the core benefits of working at JLS. We want happy, productive employees who work hard, but enjoy their lives outside of work. See the \u201cHours\u201d section above for more details. Pretty much, as long as you\u2019re getting a lot of shit done, we\u2019re never gonna sweat you on hours. If you\u2019re sick, take the day. If your kid is sick, take the day. We 100% believe that family and friends come first and that no one can live optimally working 80 hour weeks.\n\nIf you want to kick ass at your job while still having a really good work-life balance, then JLS is very likely the place for you.\n\nHow Are You Funded?\nWe are 100% self-funded. There are no venture capitalists pulling the strings. We answer to ourselves, and can do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the company and all of its stakeholders versus just optimizing for saleability.\n\nAre You a Cult?\nNo no no\u2026 We are an organization that promotes love.\n\nAre You Planning to Get Big Then Sell the Company?\nWe are planning to get big, yes, but we have absolutely no plans to sell. The founder views JLS as his life\u2019s work. We may eventually sell off individual assets, like product lines, but there is absolutely no intention of ever selling the whole company. You don\u2019t need to worry about private equity MBAs coming in and ruining everything, the founder does that all by himself.\n\nDo You Give Raises Often?\nWe very, very rarely have to have someone ask for raise to get one. Seriously. We do our absolute best to get ahead of it. Cheaping out on good people is not a recipe for long-term success. If you\u2019re kicking ass at your job and taking on more and more responsibility, then a raise is basically inevitable. We\u2019ve had people who have had their salaries nearly double in under 6 months because they proved to be so awesome \u2013 this is not typical but it\u2019s definitely possible. We want you thinking about how to kick ass, not how to pay the bills.\n\nDo You Have Nap Facilities On-Site?\nDo you think this is amateur hour? Of course we do:\n\n\n\nHow Will I Be Evaluated?\nWe want everyone to know exactly what they have to do to be successful. Every employee has a detailed list of the behaviors and outcomes that constitute success. You\u2019ll have a weekly One-on-One with your manager, regular feedback (if you could be doing anything better), and an official quarterly evaluation. This is definitely not a place where you only get feedback once a year.\n\nIs It True You Have to Tell the CEO to Go Fuck Himself?\nThat. Is. Absolutely. Completely. Ridiculous.\n\nI Am an Engineer. Is JLS the Place for Me?\nWe are still early days when it comes to building an engineering team, but we think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll like it a lot here:\n\n\u2013 The CEO understands the maker vs manager schedule\n\n\u2013 The CEO has been the de-facto head engineer and IT guy for his whole life, so his chance of \u201cgetting it\u201d is much higher than normal\n\n\u2013 Full-time remote work, so you can work when and where you want (no cubicle or open office bullshit \u2013 fuck that noise)\n\n\u2013 No/minimal interruptions \u2013 we loathe unnecessary meetings and recognize that the only way to get a lot done is long stretches of deep work\n\n\u2013 Engineers are treated with respect and admiration\n\n\u2013 We are committed to passing the Joel Test\n\n\u2013 No politics \u2013 personal considerations will not outweigh the technical considerations\n\n\u2013 We won\u2019t fight you on using whatever technology you need \u2013 within reason\n\n\u2013 We\u2019ll invest in your training and education \u2013 buy whatever books and courses you want on the company dime\n\n\u2013 No crunch\n\nWe want to make a worker\u2019s paradise, which certainly includes engineers. We think you\u2019ll like it a lot here.\n\nWhat Type of Toilet Paper Do You Provide?\nNow I know you\u2019re thinking, what kind of weird fucking place advertises the toilet paper they use, but we believe it\u2019s actually a good indicator of if a company cares or not. We\u2019ve all used that horrible 1-ply junk that isn\u2019t even fit for prisons. Because we care about our employees, we use the thick, rippled Cottonelle (or equivalent \u2013 we choose whatever the best option is available at Costco when we go). And now you get to say to people that this random company tried to convert you to applying for a job by saying that its toilet paper was good. What a time to be alive!\n\nIs This Utopia?\nLife is definitely really nice here, but no, it\u2019s not utopia or some socialist paradise. It is a pretty great place to work, and for nearly everyone who works here, it\u2019s the best place they\u2019ve ever worked by far, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re perfect. Everything is a constant work in progress. We are lead and staffed by people, and people are imperfect. Emails still get missed, tasks still get dropped, and the CEO still randomly flings feces from time to time. We\u2019re human here, but we are also doing our absolute best to be great to each other. It\u2019ll be a never ending process, but damnit we\u2019re trying.\n\nWhy Do You Swear So much?\nMy gut reaction was to say, \u201cBecause fuck you. That\u2019s why.\u201d But I stopped myself. From our Values Document:\n\nProfessionalism impedes communication by putting an invisible wall between two people. It\u2019s so much harder to communicate effectively if you have to couch your language in corporate-speak. Let your guard down and be real with people. If you can\u2019t joke around with your coworkers, what\u2019s the fucking point?\n\nAlso:\n\nFuck Is a Great Word\n\nI Applied, but I Haven\u2019t Heard Back. What\u2019s the Deal?\nIf you applied straight through Indeed.com (or similar job site) and not through our custom process (it would be a \u201cApplyToJob.com\u201d URL), then we have not seen your application. We try to make it clear to apply through our custom link, and not through the website, but sometimes people miss it (it\u2019s literally the first thing in the job ad, though).\n\nIf you did apply through our custom process, then please check your spam. We do indeed respond to everyone but often, our emails go to spam, which is really annoying. If you still can\u2019t find a response, please email us \u2013 I promise we are not purposefully messing with you.\n\nWhy Is Your Careers Page so FUCKING Long?\nYou should see our onboarding documentation! You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nWe really want you to know what you\u2019re potentially getting into. The founder has been called many things \u2013 the most humble person on the planet, guy who gets paid by the word, tax evader, etc. But he has never been called out for getting someone invested into something under false circumstances. We want you to know exactly what kind of people we are, so that you can decide for yourself if we\u2019re the right place for you (we think we\u2019re pretty great, but we\u2019re also definitely not for everyone).\n\nOur hiring process is hard, and if you\u2019re potentially leaving a good job to come here, we want you to be quite sure that you\u2019re making a good decision. So, we write a lot!\n\nPlus, haven\u2019t you enjoyed reading through this fever dream of a job site?\n\nIs This Seriously a Real Place?\nYup! And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! I know it sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s okay. Many of our employees thought the same way at first. Plus, get this: the owner just started paying everyone with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons \u2013 we\u2019re big time, people. Concluding video from the CEO to convince you. I guess the best 3-word-definition of JLS (which is written by a candidate) is:\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 902cc76ed5921f6cc8cfa2fad10f80d55bfe2ec3-1.png\n\nThank you!\n\nHow Do I Apply?\nGlad you\u2019re interested! Near the bottom of our posts on the various job boards, you will find a link to an application form. Open that link, fill out the form, and you\u2019ll be in our system. We get back to everyone, so please check your spam folder if you haven\u2019t heard from us. Good luck and thank you for your time!\n\nOther Questions?

It emphasizes a casual, direct, and somewhat irreverent tone, suggesting a workplace that values transparency, individuality, and a lack of bureaucracy. The page highlights various benefits such as flexibility in work hours, the opportunity for rapid career advancement, remote work options, and a strong emphasis on personal happiness and work-life balance.\n\nJLS Trading Co. positions itself as an anti-corporate, rapidly growing e-commerce business that doesn&#x27;t shy away from unorthodox methods of operation, including encouraging employees to challenge authority, such as telling the CEO off as a norm. The company also emphasizes continuous learning and growth, providing extensive internal resources and training opportunities.\n\nThe recruitment strategy is clearly aimed at attracting a specific type of employee\u2014someone who is results-driven, comfortable with a high degree of freedom and responsibility, and fits into a culture that is relaxed yet demanding. The page also makes it clear that traditional corporate individuals concerned with stability and a conventional hierarchy may not find JLS to be the right fit.\n\nOverall, JLS Trading Co. appears to be seeking to attract innovative and driven individuals who thrive in a dynamic and unconventional setting, and who are eager to contribute to a company that promises to be both challenging and rewarding."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2327e-4c03-40dc-bc1e-2352179ea9be", "request_id": "874f4185df9b4bf5-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2327e-4c03-40dc-bc1e-2352179ea9be", "children": ["aaa258d4-6862-4678-8fde-302aada15707"]}, "aaa258d4-6862-4678-8fde-302aada15707": {"id": "aaa258d4-6862-4678-8fde-302aada15707", "message": {"id": "aaa258d4-6862-4678-8fde-302aada15707", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713219395.632095, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["JLS Trading Co logo\nReady to Be Happy at Work Again?\nCome Join the Adult-Sized Children of the Fast-Growing, 8-Figure E-Commerce Enigma Known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nLook at these sexy motherfuckers\nWhy Should I Work for JLS Trading Co.?\nThe short version is that you will be working with a company that legitimately cares about your happiness, you\u2019ll be able to learn and grow rapidly, you\u2019ll get high levels of flexibility that are basically unparalleled, and you\u2019ll get to participate in building a company that intends to make the world a better place. You don\u2019t believe me? See what our employees think here.\n\nWhat\u2019s JLS Like?\nYou Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don\u2019t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you\u2019re not \u2013 you can just be you.\n\nMajor Opportunities for Career Growth. We don\u2019t want to settle for just being a small business \u2013 we plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done. If you\u2019re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We\u2019re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you\u2019re gonna like it here.\n\nStrongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it\u2019s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within a few weeks of getting hired (seriously).\n\nComplete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\nFull-Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.\n\nNo Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFlexible Work Hours. This doesn\u2019t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I\u2019m skeptical)? This is the place for you.\n\nSupportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard but is 100% happy to help you if you\u2019re running into trouble.\n\nNo Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can\u2019t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.\n\nLots of Raises (for People Who Kick Ass). We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don\u2019t have to ask for one. It\u2019s not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\nHealth Insurance. Get access to our (pretty darned good) health insurance from the day you start. Or if you\u2019re outside the US, then get reimbursed monthly for finding your own health insurance.\n\nNo Assholes Allowed. We try very, very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.\n\nRegular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Feedback is really, really important here. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don\u2019t bullshit \u2013 when you\u2019re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to improve. And when you\u2019re doing well, we do our best to tell you.\n\nWe\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want everyone in the company to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\nHow Much Will I Learn?\nSo, so much! We can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll learn more in your first 6 months than you did during your entire school career. We have literally thousands of internal training documents, and spend lots and lots of effort helping people learn new skills.\n\nIf you want a taste, then here is the founder\u2019s list of publicly available documents. There are another 1,500+ things only available to JLS folks, and we add 50+ new things per month on average.\n\nBasically, if learning is one of your priorities in an employer, then we are absolutely the place for you.\n\nWhat Is JLS\u2019s Mission?\nIn short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).\n\nWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re successful at achieving this goal when:\n\n1. We have the right people on the bus and they\u2019re in the right seats.\n\n2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.\n\n3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn\u2019t dream of working anywhere else.\n\n4. Our customers love us.\n\n5. We\u2019re having a ton of fun.\n\n6. We\u2019re making a ton of money.\n\nAll of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success. This business doesn\u2019t exist to make the founder rich, though that will hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of these things and won\u2019t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.\n\nWhat Are Your Values?\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly, so if you don\u2019t 100% agree with these, then we aren\u2019t the place for you. Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:\n\n\nDo You Have a Detailed Company Vision?\nCheck it out here.\n\nCan I See Some Interviews with Your People?\nFor sure. See JLS Employee Testimonials.\n\nWhy Is Your Website Ugly? You Do Realize It\u2019s Not 1999 Right?\nOK first off, ouch. I\u2019ll have you know that the founder\u2019s college roommate\u2019s teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.\n\nSecond, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate. I\u2019ll bet from this single page, you\u2019ll learn more about our company than the last 10 companies you looked at put together, even if your eyes bleed in the process!\n\nFurther, we don\u2019t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She\u2019s no fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of the Company?\nHere is a carefully-crafted, undoubtedly white-washed history of the enigma known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nCan You Share Employee Feedback from Your Annual Company Survey?\nSee some key results and direct feedback from current employees here (including their criticisms \u2013 we really mean it when we say there\u2019s no BS). Some responses have been removed for including personally identifiable information or if it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to share the feedback publicly, but otherwise, results are posted as-is. This is probably a very informative tool for hearing what real-life employees have to say about us.\n\nAre You Hiring?\nIf we are hiring, then you can see our active jobs here: Link.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any jobs that look right for you, don\u2019t worry. We are always looking to add smart and capable people to our team. You can fill out our General Application Form, and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out.\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to be informed when there is a new open position at JLS Trading Co., feel free to sign up for our Open Positions Newsletter and we will make sure to send you one of our highly trained messenger pigeons. Yes, pigeons! Have you looked at this website? What did you expect?\n\nCan I Work Remotely (Even World-Wide)?\nFor office/knowledge-work jobs: 100%. In fact, we want to be a remote-only company as much as reasonably possible, if only to save on rent because the CEO is cheap AF, but more so because working remotely is on-balance so much better for everyone involved. Imagine never having to commute or wear pants ever again!\n\nMost of our employees are in the USA, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way. We currently work with people in multiple US states, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Argentina, India, Mexico, and more (we\u2019re too lazy to update this list as we grow, FYI). We legitimately don\u2019t care where you live, as long as you\u2019re fucking awesome at your job (and really fucking nice).\n\nUnfortunately, the geo-flexibility and work from home does not apply to inventory/production-related jobs, where we have to have you on-site, since you have to physically interact with product. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wish there were some way to make it work.\n\nBut for computer work, we 100% encourage/demand that you do it at home. We\u2019ll buy you a laptop and give you money to get your home office set up, too.\n\nHow Many People Do You Have?\nHere is our live breakdown because we got tired of manually updating this page. As of Summer 2021, around 40% of our folks work in the warehouse getting things out the door, and the rest work remotely doing office/marketing/other stuff (like making sure the founder knows he\u2019s an idiot). Around 2/3 of our remote/office staff work outside the USA.\n\nAre You Fashion Forward?\nYou bet your ass:\n\n\nWhat Are the Hours Like?\nProduction/inventory jobs have stricter start times than others (it\u2019s the nature of the beast unfortunately), but almost all other jobs offer flexible hours. We don\u2019t care exactly when you work, so long as you get your work done. If you want to start at 7:00 AM, fantastic. If you want to start at 10:00 AM, by all means. If you want to go to the gym at 1:00 PM, good on you. If you want to go see your kid\u2019s T-Ball game, well\u2026 Bring beer because those are just awful.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re absolutely crushing it, we basically don\u2019t give a shit when you clock in or out (some jobs have tighter work windows though).\n\nIn our humble (but obviously right) opinion, there are three types of people:\n\n1. People who cannot possibly be effective regularly working 60+ hours per week\n\n2. Liars\n\n3. Cocaine addicts\n\nSo, for us, hourly full-time employees are expected to work a minimum of 38 hours per week and full-time salaried employees are expected to work around 40-45 hours per week. If you have to go over that number regularly, you\u2019re gonna get yelled at.\n\nIs There Opportunity for Advancement?\nOh man, is there ever. Our ambitions are limitless (see the vision for more details). We aren\u2019t just growing with GDP \u2013 we are trying to grow 100% a year for basically eternity, which categorically means that if you\u2019re smart and capable (like really smart and capable), then you will never want for more opportunities. Presuming you are damned good, then you will get as much opportunity and responsibility as you want (and maybe more than that).\n\nIf you want to advance probably 10x faster than a normal corporate job, we are the place for you.\n\nIs the Company Actually Growing Fast?\nYou Decide. Revenue by Year:\n\n2014 \u2013 $354k\n\n2015 \u2013 $1.35m\n\n2016 \u2013 $2.2m\n\n2017 \u2013 $3.3m\n\n2018 \u2013 $5.6m\n\n2019 \u2013 $9.7m\n\n2020 \u2013 $10.6 (2020 was\u2026interesting)\n\n2021 \u2013 $17.3m\n\n2022 \u2013 $19m\n\nWe share revenue numbers to increase the chances that high-quality people don\u2019t think that we\u2019re full of shit. All this growth means that there are lots and lots of opportunities for capable, ambitious people. Plus all financials are shared with all employees on a monthly basis so everyone knows exactly where the company is at \u2013 the No Bullshit value is just that: No Bullshit.\n\nWhere Do You Store Your Male Models?\nIn multiple locations around the warehouse:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Testimonials\nSee our reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google. And check out the survey results above for more direct feedback from employees.\n\nFrom John P:\n\nJLS has been the greatest place to work in my life. I love working here because I am challenged on a daily basis to do new and interesting things, I am given the freedom to figure out how to do those things, and I know that I can trust in my very reasonable and thoughtful management team. It\u2019s a new company with a lot of opportunities, in the sense that, we\u2019re always looking for a better way to do things, so as somebody that likes to think of new methods and test them out, I\u2019m very happy because I can try new things and new ways of doing things.\n\nFrom Ben W:\n\nI previously worked in corporate America and never had any idea how what I did impacted the company\u2019s success. Now, I am working in a company where everyone from the owner to the newest hire meets weekly to review individual and company successes, failures, and lessons learned. Knowing why what I do matters while working with smart people in a culture that pushes me to improve myself on a day to day basis has been a revelation, and I look forward to continuing to take part in the growth of the business for years to come.\n\nFrom Drew B:\n\nJLS has by far been the best place I have ever worked. My work/life balance has never been better, and everyone seems to genuinely care about my personal happiness. My job history has spanned a wide variety of businesses and industries. I have even run my own business. It wasn\u2019t until I came to JLS that I realized how important a good culture fit can be. We expect a lot out of each other, and we work hard at being a unified team.\n\nWhat Is Turnover Like?\nVoluntary turnover is super low. Like super, super low. The things that cause people to be asked to leave are:\n\n1. Values non-fit. We joke around a lot, but we take our values very seriously.\n\n2. They can\u2019t do the job. We are stringent that you have to kick ass. We will absolutely give you the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, but if you\u2019re not a smart mofo, then we\u2019re forced to act for the good of the group.\n\nHowever, because we\u2019re a high-feedback environment, you will absolutely know ahead of time what your boss thinks about your performance and what you need to do to improve.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t You on Social Media?\n1. The founder refuses to upgrade his mobile device from his TI-83 and LinkedIn stupidly hasn\u2019t released an app for it yet.\n\n2. Have you, like, ever been on social media? It\u2019s awful.\n\n3. We keep getting kicked off of Myspace for being \u201ctoo emo\u201d which honestly just makes us even more emo.\n\n4. We probably will at some point, but mostly we\u2019re just lazy.\n\nHow Many Meetings Are There?\nAs few as fucking possible. We do everything we can to encourage people to just email vs doing a quick chat or a meeting, so there are very, very few set meetings in the company. Amongst the worst feedback a manager can receive is that they regularly hold meetings that could have been an email. It\u2019s pretty nice to not have to sit through useless, bullshit meetings and just have to read the founder\u2019s useless, bullshit emails instead.\n\nWho Is JLS Not For?\nThis is a good question. JLS is probably not for you if you:\n\n\u2013 Want a stable job that doesn\u2019t change very often\n\n\u2013 Like the security that comes from working for a very large company\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy building things, and all that comes along with that\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t believe that everything can be optimized, for basically forever\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy discovering the truth through friendly back and forth discussion\n\n\u2013 Care about status\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like really considering other people\u2019s feelings before doing things\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like wearing multiple hats\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like dealing with ambiguity/the unknown\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like being in a place that is very careful about not wasting resources\n\n\u2013 Thrive in a political rather than a results-based environment\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy letting your guard down and just being yourself with your coworkers\n\nWe are definitely not for everyone. We are effectively a startup that is trying to be a giant company, which clearly has trade-offs, but if all of that isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you, then why not take a shot and apply?\n\nWhat Kind of Car Does the CEO Drive?\nWell first off, the CEO refuses to leave the house/put pants on, so there is some internal debate as to whether or not he actually exists.\n\nBut when he does leave the house, he drives his sexy AF 2004 Toyota 4Runner or his wife\u2019s 2008 Toyota Sienna, which is slightly less sexy but has so much room for activities. Probably don\u2019t ask him about the cars though, unless you want a 30-minute lecture on why high-mileage Toyotas are hands-down the best value on the planet.\n\nDo You Believe in Work-Life Balance?\nWork Life Balance at JLS Trading Co.\n\nThe above never happens at JLS \u2013 we instituted a rule saying you can\u2019t stab people in the head a long time ago. Sometimes we amaze ourselves at how generous we are.\n\nWork/Life Balance is one of the core benefits of working at JLS. We want happy, productive employees who work hard, but enjoy their lives outside of work. See the \u201cHours\u201d section above for more details. Pretty much, as long as you\u2019re getting a lot of shit done, we\u2019re never gonna sweat you on hours. If you\u2019re sick, take the day. If your kid is sick, take the day. We 100% believe that family and friends come first and that no one can live optimally working 80 hour weeks.\n\nIf you want to kick ass at your job while still having a really good work-life balance, then JLS is very likely the place for you.\n\nHow Are You Funded?\nWe are 100% self-funded. There are no venture capitalists pulling the strings. We answer to ourselves, and can do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the company and all of its stakeholders versus just optimizing for saleability.\n\nAre You a Cult?\nNo no no\u2026 We are an organization that promotes love.\n\nAre You Planning to Get Big Then Sell the Company?\nWe are planning to get big, yes, but we have absolutely no plans to sell. The founder views JLS as his life\u2019s work. We may eventually sell off individual assets, like product lines, but there is absolutely no intention of ever selling the whole company. You don\u2019t need to worry about private equity MBAs coming in and ruining everything, the founder does that all by himself.\n\nDo You Give Raises Often?\nWe very, very rarely have to have someone ask for raise to get one. Seriously. We do our absolute best to get ahead of it. Cheaping out on good people is not a recipe for long-term success. If you\u2019re kicking ass at your job and taking on more and more responsibility, then a raise is basically inevitable. We\u2019ve had people who have had their salaries nearly double in under 6 months because they proved to be so awesome \u2013 this is not typical but it\u2019s definitely possible. We want you thinking about how to kick ass, not how to pay the bills.\n\nDo You Have Nap Facilities On-Site?\nDo you think this is amateur hour? Of course we do:\n\n\n\nHow Will I Be Evaluated?\nWe want everyone to know exactly what they have to do to be successful. Every employee has a detailed list of the behaviors and outcomes that constitute success. You\u2019ll have a weekly One-on-One with your manager, regular feedback (if you could be doing anything better), and an official quarterly evaluation. This is definitely not a place where you only get feedback once a year.\n\nIs It True You Have to Tell the CEO to Go Fuck Himself?\nThat. Is. Absolutely. Completely. Ridiculous.\n\nI Am an Engineer. Is JLS the Place for Me?\nWe are still early days when it comes to building an engineering team, but we think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll like it a lot here:\n\n\u2013 The CEO understands the maker vs manager schedule\n\n\u2013 The CEO has been the de-facto head engineer and IT guy for his whole life, so his chance of \u201cgetting it\u201d is much higher than normal\n\n\u2013 Full-time remote work, so you can work when and where you want (no cubicle or open office bullshit \u2013 fuck that noise)\n\n\u2013 No/minimal interruptions \u2013 we loathe unnecessary meetings and recognize that the only way to get a lot done is long stretches of deep work\n\n\u2013 Engineers are treated with respect and admiration\n\n\u2013 We are committed to passing the Joel Test\n\n\u2013 No politics \u2013 personal considerations will not outweigh the technical considerations\n\n\u2013 We won\u2019t fight you on using whatever technology you need \u2013 within reason\n\n\u2013 We\u2019ll invest in your training and education \u2013 buy whatever books and courses you want on the company dime\n\n\u2013 No crunch\n\nWe want to make a worker\u2019s paradise, which certainly includes engineers. We think you\u2019ll like it a lot here.\n\nWhat Type of Toilet Paper Do You Provide?\nNow I know you\u2019re thinking, what kind of weird fucking place advertises the toilet paper they use, but we believe it\u2019s actually a good indicator of if a company cares or not. We\u2019ve all used that horrible 1-ply junk that isn\u2019t even fit for prisons. Because we care about our employees, we use the thick, rippled Cottonelle (or equivalent \u2013 we choose whatever the best option is available at Costco when we go). And now you get to say to people that this random company tried to convert you to applying for a job by saying that its toilet paper was good. What a time to be alive!\n\nIs This Utopia?\nLife is definitely really nice here, but no, it\u2019s not utopia or some socialist paradise. It is a pretty great place to work, and for nearly everyone who works here, it\u2019s the best place they\u2019ve ever worked by far, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re perfect. Everything is a constant work in progress. We are lead and staffed by people, and people are imperfect. Emails still get missed, tasks still get dropped, and the CEO still randomly flings feces from time to time. We\u2019re human here, but we are also doing our absolute best to be great to each other. It\u2019ll be a never ending process, but damnit we\u2019re trying.\n\nWhy Do You Swear So much?\nMy gut reaction was to say, \u201cBecause fuck you. That\u2019s why.\u201d But I stopped myself. From our Values Document:\n\nProfessionalism impedes communication by putting an invisible wall between two people. It\u2019s so much harder to communicate effectively if you have to couch your language in corporate-speak. Let your guard down and be real with people. If you can\u2019t joke around with your coworkers, what\u2019s the fucking point?\n\nAlso:\n\nFuck Is a Great Word\n\nI Applied, but I Haven\u2019t Heard Back. What\u2019s the Deal?\nIf you applied straight through Indeed.com (or similar job site) and not through our custom process (it would be a \u201cApplyToJob.com\u201d URL), then we have not seen your application. We try to make it clear to apply through our custom link, and not through the website, but sometimes people miss it (it\u2019s literally the first thing in the job ad, though).\n\nIf you did apply through our custom process, then please check your spam. We do indeed respond to everyone but often, our emails go to spam, which is really annoying. If you still can\u2019t find a response, please email us \u2013 I promise we are not purposefully messing with you.\n\nWhy Is Your Careers Page so FUCKING Long?\nYou should see our onboarding documentation! You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nWe really want you to know what you\u2019re potentially getting into. The founder has been called many things \u2013 the most humble person on the planet, guy who gets paid by the word, tax evader, etc. But he has never been called out for getting someone invested into something under false circumstances. We want you to know exactly what kind of people we are, so that you can decide for yourself if we\u2019re the right place for you (we think we\u2019re pretty great, but we\u2019re also definitely not for everyone).\n\nOur hiring process is hard, and if you\u2019re potentially leaving a good job to come here, we want you to be quite sure that you\u2019re making a good decision. So, we write a lot!\n\nPlus, haven\u2019t you enjoyed reading through this fever dream of a job site?\n\nIs This Seriously a Real Place?\nYup! And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! I know it sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s okay. Many of our employees thought the same way at first. Plus, get this: the owner just started paying everyone with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons \u2013 we\u2019re big time, people. Concluding video from the CEO to convince you. I guess the best 3-word-definition of JLS (which is written by a candidate) is:\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 902cc76ed5921f6cc8cfa2fad10f80d55bfe2ec3-1.png\n\nThank you!\n\nHow Do I Apply?\nGlad you\u2019re interested! Near the bottom of our posts on the various job boards, you will find a link to an application form. Open that link, fill out the form, and you\u2019ll be in our system. We get back to everyone, so please check your spam folder if you haven\u2019t heard from us. Good luck and thank you for your time!\n\nOther Questions? E-mail us: Careers@JLSTradingCo.com\n\nThis is the JLS careers page and  below is the job posting:\n\nIt for this job posting: \n\n- Do you enjoy learning about people, then judging them harshly?\n\n- Do you get off on finding diamonds in the rough?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\n \nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don\u2019t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Here&#x27;s a refined and enhanced version of your answer to clearly articulate the impact of your initiative and highlight your strengths:\n\n&quot;In my previous role, I spearheaded a significant overhaul of our customer complaint handling process, specifically targeting complaints related to bus operators. Initially, we received an average of 50 to 100 complaints per month, often skewing towards the higher end. Recognizing the need for improvement, I implemented a new procedure that actively involved bus operators from the outset of each complaint investigation.\n\nInstead of approaching operators with pre-determined conclusions, we engaged them directly in reviewing incidents. This shift not only increased transparency but also fostered a more inclusive and collaborative environment. As a result, we observed a noticeable reduction in customer complaints\u2014down by 10 to 15%, with monthly figures dropping to between 50 and 85, more often on the lower side of that range.\n\nMore importantly, this change had a profound positive impact on bus operator satisfaction. In subsequent surveys, operators expressed significant appreciation for the new process, highlighting how being involved in the investigation phases made them feel respected and valued. This not only enhanced their job satisfaction but also improved their engagement and accountability, which contributed to the overall decrease in complaints.\n\nThis experience demonstrated my ability to lead change effectively, improving both customer satisfaction and employee engagement through strategic process adjustments.&quot; \n\nThis response clearly outlines the problem, the action you took, the results of your initiative, and the broader impact on the organization, positioning you as a proactive and thoughtful leader."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2d800-26d2-4a8c-93da-c5b3b68338a8", "request_id": "874fd6f43ca3a25f-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2d800-26d2-4a8c-93da-c5b3b68338a8", "children": []}, "aaa26317-e598-4b8c-8568-ff255176df90": {"id": "aaa26317-e598-4b8c-8568-ff255176df90", "message": {"id": "aaa26317-e598-4b8c-8568-ff255176df90", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713225261.022264, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["This is another question: \n\nPlease describe a time where you changed something (a process or procedure perhaps) at work (or similar) that led to increased efficiency, general happiness or an increase in productivity. \n\nI have a bit of a crude answer to this question below. can yo improve it for clarity and you can take creative license to make it better answer the question and position me as the best candidate. \n\n\nWhen I worked as a service delivery manager for Jacksonville Transportation Authority, one of my responsibilities was that I was one of three service delivery managers that headed up the operations group. We led the supervisors, which led the bus operators. Uh, we had a bit of a clunky process for handling, um, customer complaints that were related directly to a specific bus operator, where it was sort of like customer service would dip their toe in and do a little bit of investigation, like maybe look at the video and go from there, like to kind of give the customer that sort of satisfaction of, you know, answering their complaint right then and there if possible. But sort of for more graver matters, or maybe like if a bus operator had like a verbal altercation with a passenger or just different sort of issues, um, it might, that might provoke like disciplinary action. We needed to do like a thorough investigation about this, especially since many of our employees were, um, contract employees, meaning that, um, they worked under a collective bargaining agreement. And so we really needed to be clear in when we applied some sort of, uh, discipline to them or seeing that they violated any rules. And so anyway, long story short, um, I just felt like it was very clunky the way it would go through customer service. Then it would come to our department, our group, and, um, the service delivery managers would have to take all the customer complaints that were for their zone, like their part of the city that they handled, and, um, give them to the bus supervisors to fully investigate. What is investigation? They would pull the video from the bus, which included audio. They would interview the bus operator about the event, and, um, they would kind of, uh, review any sort of radio communication that might have occurred at the time and sort of to come to a conclusion about what might have occurred, if there were any sort of violations, et cetera. And then if we did find that there was something that was a violation and required disciplinary action, at that point, we needed to, um, initiate disciplinary proceedings. Like, um, basically it was like, uh, I forget what they called it. It was like, almost like court. Anyways, long story short, I thought this is too much. This is not helping customer service skills develop amongst bus operators. This is not an efficient way to do it because these investigations take time. Who is going to remember the conversation they had with a passenger? Maybe sometimes in passing, like they just told them, no, you can&#x27;t bring your, um, pet dog on the bus. Things like this, you know, things of this nature. Um, so what I thought would be better, and I kind of brought this to my manager and we implemented this plan, is that, um, you instead, customer service would give all of these customer complaints to us. We would, A, use it as, um, a learning experience for the bus operators, not so much a learning experience, but like, uh, uh, opportunity for development. And we would, instead of doing our own investigation alone, we would sit down with them in the very outset with the video and the customer complaint. And we&#x27;d sort of review the video, discuss it with them, see what their thoughts were and develop an action plan. And if we felt like, well, maybe like sometimes, a lot of times they said, oh, I was upset that day. But if they felt like they could have done a better job, we set up an action plan so that it never happens again. Um, if it&#x27;s something that is like a clear violation of rules, and then we need to continue with disciplinary proceedings, um, at times the action plan would stood in place, like this was their first try. And if they had a problem with this in the past, then we sort of proceed to the next step in the disciplinary process. And the action plan is just sort of irrelevant. But my idea was this action plan and this sit down meeting with them. And then a couple of weeks later, we would sit down with them again, just kind of checking in, see how they&#x27;re doing with it. And it was a great way to kind of touch bases with the employees to kind of get a pulse for them. And at the same time handle these customer complaints, because afterwards, we would go back to customer service, give them a full report kind of via email, mind you in the system. And sometimes they would have the kind of the go ahead to reach back out to the customer and if it warranted give them free stuff or whatever. In any case, this plan really had such a positive impact. We found that generally we would get regarding bus operates, we would get something like 50 to 100 complaints a month, you know, it ranged. Afterwards, and it was usually more towards the hundred, you know. Afterwards, though, we found that there was almost like a I would say about a 10 to 15% reduction in the sort of like customer complaint incidents where it&#x27;s directed at specifically a bus driver.

Here\u2019s a refined and structured version of your answer that highlights your role, the challenges, your solution, and the results more clearly:\n\n---\n\n&quot;As a Service Delivery Manager at Jacksonville Transportation Authority, I led operations and managed a team that included supervisors responsible for bus operators. One of the challenges we faced was handling customer complaints directed at bus operators, which involved a cumbersome and inefficient process that lacked clear and timely resolutions, especially in cases that could lead to disciplinary actions.\n\nInitially, customer service would conduct a preliminary investigation and, for more severe issues, pass the complaint to our department. We, the service delivery managers, then tasked supervisors with a full investigation, including video review, interviewing the bus operator, and examining radio communications. This lengthy process often delayed resolutions and didn\u2019t contribute to bus operators&#x27; development or customer satisfaction.\n\nRecognizing the inefficiencies and the opportunity for improvement, I proposed a more proactive approach. Instead of isolating the investigation to our internal team, we included bus operators early in the process. We transformed initial complaint reviews into collaborative sessions, where we discussed the incident with the operator using the video as a guide, assessed their perspective, and together developed an action plan aimed at preventing future occurrences. This approach not only expedited the resolution process but also served as a developmental tool for the operators.\n\nWe implemented this plan across the board, and it resulted in a significant decrease in customer complaints\u2014from an average of 100 per month to between 50 and 85, marking up to a 15% reduction. More importantly, it dramatically improved bus operator satisfaction, as reflected in internal surveys. Operators appreciated being involved from the outset, which helped them feel valued and understood within the organization.\n\nThis initiative not only streamlined our complaint handling process but also fostered a more positive and inclusive work environment, enhancing overall satisfaction and reducing conflict incidences.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis version of your response is more concise, focuses on your proactive leadership, and directly links your actions to measurable outcomes, effectively showcasing your problem-solving skills and your strategic approach to operational challenges."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "aaa26317-e598-4b8c-8568-ff255176df90", "request_id": "874fdc373d6874f0-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa26317-e598-4b8c-8568-ff255176df90", "children": ["aaa23ac2-d385-471f-8239-d0c39517cbbe"]}, "aaa23ac2-d385-471f-8239-d0c39517cbbe": {"id": "aaa23ac2-d385-471f-8239-d0c39517cbbe", "message": {"id": "aaa23ac2-d385-471f-8239-d0c39517cbbe", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713225544.308623, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What is this: Do you Inbox Zero?

Keeping it clean can help reduce anxiety about missing important communications.\n\n**Why Some People Don&#x27;t Practice Inbox Zero:**\n- **Time-Consuming**: Constantly managing emails can be seen as an interruption, detracting from more important work.\n- **Not Always Practical**: For those receiving a high volume of emails, reaching inbox zero daily may not be practical.\n- **Preference for Alternative Methods**: Some find other methods of email management more effective, such as using extensive labeling and folders, or setting specific times to check emails.\n\nWhether you should aim for Inbox Zero depends on your job role, email volume, personal work style, and how email impacts your productivity and stress levels.

The ability to directly apply what I learned from the book in real-world scenarios has been immensely beneficial, reinforcing my skills in a way that theoretical study alone could not achieve.\n\nReading &#x27;Python All-in-One For Dummies&#x27; has not only broadened my technical expertise but has also boosted my confidence in handling more complex projects that require robust programming solutions.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis response showcases how the book has directly contributed to your professional growth, emphasizing the practical application of the knowledge gained and your proactive approach to learning and skill enhancement."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa21b7e-148b-4af8-9077-6f506ba3850e", "request_id": "875013f35efba325-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa21b7e-148b-4af8-9077-6f506ba3850e", "children": ["aaa28c19-3cd7-4215-8735-8b12be8377c5"]}, "aaa28c19-3cd7-4215-8735-8b12be8377c5": {"id": "aaa28c19-3cd7-4215-8735-8b12be8377c5", "message": {"id": "aaa28c19-3cd7-4215-8735-8b12be8377c5", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713227639.191387, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["BUT i DON&#x27;T KNOW PYTHON PROGRAMMING THAT WELL SO DON&#x27;T MAKE ME SOUND LIKE AN ACE. i&#x27;VE JUST DABBLED AND YOU (CHAT GPT) HELPED ME A LOT"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87501646aac1a319-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "40e1fffa-e576-45e5-ace2-54d518a55bcb", "children": ["26a7d407-40d9-444f-b00a-2a3bbd86e122"]}, "26a7d407-40d9-444f-b00a-2a3bbd86e122": {"id": "26a7d407-40d9-444f-b00a-2a3bbd86e122", "message": {"id": "26a7d407-40d9-444f-b00a-2a3bbd86e122", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713227653.562027, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Understood!

The book breaks down Python into digestible segments, each designed to build a foundational understanding of key concepts and basic applications.\n\nWhat I found particularly valuable was the book&#x27;s emphasis on practical exercises and examples, which helped me transition from theory to practice at a comfortable pace. These exercises allowed me to apply what I learned in simple, real-world tasks, reinforcing my understanding and gradually increasing my confidence in using Python for basic programming tasks.\n\nThis learning journey has been instrumental in enhancing my analytical thinking and has sparked a deeper interest in data analysis, a skill I am keen to develop further. &#x27;Python All-in-One For Dummies&#x27; has not only expanded my technical skill set but also motivated me to continue learning and exploring Python programming, using tools like ChatGPT to supplement my studies and clarify complex topics.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis version presents you as a beginner who is actively engaged in learning Python, highlighting your initiative and willingness to explore new skills without overstating your current level of expertise.

You don\u2019t believe me? See what our employees think here.\n\nWhat\u2019s JLS Like?\nYou Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don\u2019t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you\u2019re not \u2013 you can just be you.\n\nMajor Opportunities for Career Growth. We don\u2019t want to settle for just being a small business \u2013 we plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done. If you\u2019re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We\u2019re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you\u2019re gonna like it here.\n\nStrongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it\u2019s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within a few weeks of getting hired (seriously).\n\nComplete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\nFull-Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.\n\nNo Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFlexible Work Hours. This doesn\u2019t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I\u2019m skeptical)? This is the place for you.\n\nSupportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard but is 100% happy to help you if you\u2019re running into trouble.\n\nNo Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can\u2019t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.\n\nLots of Raises (for People Who Kick Ass). We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don\u2019t have to ask for one. It\u2019s not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\nHealth Insurance. Get access to our (pretty darned good) health insurance from the day you start. Or if you\u2019re outside the US, then get reimbursed monthly for finding your own health insurance.\n\nNo Assholes Allowed. We try very, very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.\n\nRegular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Feedback is really, really important here. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don\u2019t bullshit \u2013 when you\u2019re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to improve. And when you\u2019re doing well, we do our best to tell you.\n\nWe\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want everyone in the company to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\nHow Much Will I Learn?\nSo, so much! We can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll learn more in your first 6 months than you did during your entire school career. We have literally thousands of internal training documents, and spend lots and lots of effort helping people learn new skills.\n\nIf you want a taste, then here is the founder\u2019s list of publicly available documents. There are another 1,500+ things only available to JLS folks, and we add 50+ new things per month on average.\n\nBasically, if learning is one of your priorities in an employer, then we are absolutely the place for you.\n\nWhat Is JLS\u2019s Mission?\nIn short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).\n\nWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re successful at achieving this goal when:\n\n1. We have the right people on the bus and they\u2019re in the right seats.\n\n2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.\n\n3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn\u2019t dream of working anywhere else.\n\n4. Our customers love us.\n\n5. We\u2019re having a ton of fun.\n\n6. We\u2019re making a ton of money.\n\nAll of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success. This business doesn\u2019t exist to make the founder rich, though that will hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of these things and won\u2019t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.\n\nWhat Are Your Values?\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly, so if you don\u2019t 100% agree with these, then we aren\u2019t the place for you. Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:\n\n\nDo You Have a Detailed Company Vision?\nCheck it out here.\n\nCan I See Some Interviews with Your People?\nFor sure. See JLS Employee Testimonials.\n\nWhy Is Your Website Ugly? You Do Realize It\u2019s Not 1999 Right?\nOK first off, ouch. I\u2019ll have you know that the founder\u2019s college roommate\u2019s teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.\n\nSecond, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate. I\u2019ll bet from this single page, you\u2019ll learn more about our company than the last 10 companies you looked at put together, even if your eyes bleed in the process!\n\nFurther, we don\u2019t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She\u2019s no fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of the Company?\nHere is a carefully-crafted, undoubtedly white-washed history of the enigma known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nCan You Share Employee Feedback from Your Annual Company Survey?\nSee some key results and direct feedback from current employees here (including their criticisms \u2013 we really mean it when we say there\u2019s no BS). Some responses have been removed for including personally identifiable information or if it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to share the feedback publicly, but otherwise, results are posted as-is. This is probably a very informative tool for hearing what real-life employees have to say about us.\n\nAre You Hiring?\nIf we are hiring, then you can see our active jobs here: Link.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any jobs that look right for you, don\u2019t worry. We are always looking to add smart and capable people to our team. You can fill out our General Application Form, and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out.\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to be informed when there is a new open position at JLS Trading Co., feel free to sign up for our Open Positions Newsletter and we will make sure to send you one of our highly trained messenger pigeons. Yes, pigeons! Have you looked at this website? What did you expect?\n\nCan I Work Remotely (Even World-Wide)?\nFor office/knowledge-work jobs: 100%. In fact, we want to be a remote-only company as much as reasonably possible, if only to save on rent because the CEO is cheap AF, but more so because working remotely is on-balance so much better for everyone involved. Imagine never having to commute or wear pants ever again!\n\nMost of our employees are in the USA, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way. We currently work with people in multiple US states, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Argentina, India, Mexico, and more (we\u2019re too lazy to update this list as we grow, FYI). We legitimately don\u2019t care where you live, as long as you\u2019re fucking awesome at your job (and really fucking nice).\n\nUnfortunately, the geo-flexibility and work from home does not apply to inventory/production-related jobs, where we have to have you on-site, since you have to physically interact with product. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wish there were some way to make it work.\n\nBut for computer work, we 100% encourage/demand that you do it at home. We\u2019ll buy you a laptop and give you money to get your home office set up, too.\n\nHow Many People Do You Have?\nHere is our live breakdown because we got tired of manually updating this page. As of Summer 2021, around 40% of our folks work in the warehouse getting things out the door, and the rest work remotely doing office/marketing/other stuff (like making sure the founder knows he\u2019s an idiot). Around 2/3 of our remote/office staff work outside the USA.\n\nAre You Fashion Forward?\nYou bet your ass:\n\n\nWhat Are the Hours Like?\nProduction/inventory jobs have stricter start times than others (it\u2019s the nature of the beast unfortunately), but almost all other jobs offer flexible hours. We don\u2019t care exactly when you work, so long as you get your work done. If you want to start at 7:00 AM, fantastic. If you want to start at 10:00 AM, by all means. If you want to go to the gym at 1:00 PM, good on you. If you want to go see your kid\u2019s T-Ball game, well\u2026 Bring beer because those are just awful.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re absolutely crushing it, we basically don\u2019t give a shit when you clock in or out (some jobs have tighter work windows though).\n\nIn our humble (but obviously right) opinion, there are three types of people:\n\n1. People who cannot possibly be effective regularly working 60+ hours per week\n\n2. Liars\n\n3. Cocaine addicts\n\nSo, for us, hourly full-time employees are expected to work a minimum of 38 hours per week and full-time salaried employees are expected to work around 40-45 hours per week. If you have to go over that number regularly, you\u2019re gonna get yelled at.\n\nIs There Opportunity for Advancement?\nOh man, is there ever. Our ambitions are limitless (see the vision for more details). We aren\u2019t just growing with GDP \u2013 we are trying to grow 100% a year for basically eternity, which categorically means that if you\u2019re smart and capable (like really smart and capable), then you will never want for more opportunities. Presuming you are damned good, then you will get as much opportunity and responsibility as you want (and maybe more than that).\n\nIf you want to advance probably 10x faster than a normal corporate job, we are the place for you.\n\nIs the Company Actually Growing Fast?\nYou Decide. Revenue by Year:\n\n2014 \u2013 $354k\n\n2015 \u2013 $1.35m\n\n2016 \u2013 $2.2m\n\n2017 \u2013 $3.3m\n\n2018 \u2013 $5.6m\n\n2019 \u2013 $9.7m\n\n2020 \u2013 $10.6 (2020 was\u2026interesting)\n\n2021 \u2013 $17.3m\n\n2022 \u2013 $19m\n\nWe share revenue numbers to increase the chances that high-quality people don\u2019t think that we\u2019re full of shit. All this growth means that there are lots and lots of opportunities for capable, ambitious people. Plus all financials are shared with all employees on a monthly basis so everyone knows exactly where the company is at \u2013 the No Bullshit value is just that: No Bullshit.\n\nWhere Do You Store Your Male Models?\nIn multiple locations around the warehouse:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Testimonials\nSee our reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google. And check out the survey results above for more direct feedback from employees.\n\nFrom John P:\n\nJLS has been the greatest place to work in my life. I love working here because I am challenged on a daily basis to do new and interesting things, I am given the freedom to figure out how to do those things, and I know that I can trust in my very reasonable and thoughtful management team. It\u2019s a new company with a lot of opportunities, in the sense that, we\u2019re always looking for a better way to do things, so as somebody that likes to think of new methods and test them out, I\u2019m very happy because I can try new things and new ways of doing things.\n\nFrom Ben W:\n\nI previously worked in corporate America and never had any idea how what I did impacted the company\u2019s success. Now, I am working in a company where everyone from the owner to the newest hire meets weekly to review individual and company successes, failures, and lessons learned. Knowing why what I do matters while working with smart people in a culture that pushes me to improve myself on a day to day basis has been a revelation, and I look forward to continuing to take part in the growth of the business for years to come.\n\nFrom Drew B:\n\nJLS has by far been the best place I have ever worked. My work/life balance has never been better, and everyone seems to genuinely care about my personal happiness. My job history has spanned a wide variety of businesses and industries. I have even run my own business. It wasn\u2019t until I came to JLS that I realized how important a good culture fit can be. We expect a lot out of each other, and we work hard at being a unified team.\n\nWhat Is Turnover Like?\nVoluntary turnover is super low. Like super, super low. The things that cause people to be asked to leave are:\n\n1. Values non-fit. We joke around a lot, but we take our values very seriously.\n\n2. They can\u2019t do the job. We are stringent that you have to kick ass. We will absolutely give you the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, but if you\u2019re not a smart mofo, then we\u2019re forced to act for the good of the group.\n\nHowever, because we\u2019re a high-feedback environment, you will absolutely know ahead of time what your boss thinks about your performance and what you need to do to improve.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t You on Social Media?\n1. The founder refuses to upgrade his mobile device from his TI-83 and LinkedIn stupidly hasn\u2019t released an app for it yet.\n\n2. Have you, like, ever been on social media? It\u2019s awful.\n\n3. We keep getting kicked off of Myspace for being \u201ctoo emo\u201d which honestly just makes us even more emo.\n\n4. We probably will at some point, but mostly we\u2019re just lazy.\n\nHow Many Meetings Are There?\nAs few as fucking possible. We do everything we can to encourage people to just email vs doing a quick chat or a meeting, so there are very, very few set meetings in the company. Amongst the worst feedback a manager can receive is that they regularly hold meetings that could have been an email. It\u2019s pretty nice to not have to sit through useless, bullshit meetings and just have to read the founder\u2019s useless, bullshit emails instead.\n\nWho Is JLS Not For?\nThis is a good question. JLS is probably not for you if you:\n\n\u2013 Want a stable job that doesn\u2019t change very often\n\n\u2013 Like the security that comes from working for a very large company\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy building things, and all that comes along with that\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t believe that everything can be optimized, for basically forever\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy discovering the truth through friendly back and forth discussion\n\n\u2013 Care about status\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like really considering other people\u2019s feelings before doing things\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like wearing multiple hats\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like dealing with ambiguity/the unknown\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like being in a place that is very careful about not wasting resources\n\n\u2013 Thrive in a political rather than a results-based environment\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy letting your guard down and just being yourself with your coworkers\n\nWe are definitely not for everyone. We are effectively a startup that is trying to be a giant company, which clearly has trade-offs, but if all of that isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you, then why not take a shot and apply?\n\nWhat Kind of Car Does the CEO Drive?\nWell first off, the CEO refuses to leave the house/put pants on, so there is some internal debate as to whether or not he actually exists.\n\nBut when he does leave the house, he drives his sexy AF 2004 Toyota 4Runner or his wife\u2019s 2008 Toyota Sienna, which is slightly less sexy but has so much room for activities. Probably don\u2019t ask him about the cars though, unless you want a 30-minute lecture on why high-mileage Toyotas are hands-down the best value on the planet.\n\nDo You Believe in Work-Life Balance?\nWork Life Balance at JLS Trading Co.\n\nThe above never happens at JLS \u2013 we instituted a rule saying you can\u2019t stab people in the head a long time ago. Sometimes we amaze ourselves at how generous we are.\n\nWork/Life Balance is one of the core benefits of working at JLS. We want happy, productive employees who work hard, but enjoy their lives outside of work. See the \u201cHours\u201d section above for more details. Pretty much, as long as you\u2019re getting a lot of shit done, we\u2019re never gonna sweat you on hours. If you\u2019re sick, take the day. If your kid is sick, take the day. We 100% believe that family and friends come first and that no one can live optimally working 80 hour weeks.\n\nIf you want to kick ass at your job while still having a really good work-life balance, then JLS is very likely the place for you.\n\nHow Are You Funded?\nWe are 100% self-funded. There are no venture capitalists pulling the strings. We answer to ourselves, and can do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the company and all of its stakeholders versus just optimizing for saleability.\n\nAre You a Cult?\nNo no no\u2026 We are an organization that promotes love.\n\nAre You Planning to Get Big Then Sell the Company?\nWe are planning to get big, yes, but we have absolutely no plans to sell. The founder views JLS as his life\u2019s work. We may eventually sell off individual assets, like product lines, but there is absolutely no intention of ever selling the whole company. You don\u2019t need to worry about private equity MBAs coming in and ruining everything, the founder does that all by himself.\n\nDo You Give Raises Often?\nWe very, very rarely have to have someone ask for raise to get one. Seriously. We do our absolute best to get ahead of it. Cheaping out on good people is not a recipe for long-term success. If you\u2019re kicking ass at your job and taking on more and more responsibility, then a raise is basically inevitable. We\u2019ve had people who have had their salaries nearly double in under 6 months because they proved to be so awesome \u2013 this is not typical but it\u2019s definitely possible. We want you thinking about how to kick ass, not how to pay the bills.\n\nDo You Have Nap Facilities On-Site?\nDo you think this is amateur hour? Of course we do:\n\n\n\nHow Will I Be Evaluated?\nWe want everyone to know exactly what they have to do to be successful. Every employee has a detailed list of the behaviors and outcomes that constitute success. You\u2019ll have a weekly One-on-One with your manager, regular feedback (if you could be doing anything better), and an official quarterly evaluation. This is definitely not a place where you only get feedback once a year.\n\nIs It True You Have to Tell the CEO to Go Fuck Himself?\nThat. Is. Absolutely. Completely. Ridiculous.\n\nI Am an Engineer. Is JLS the Place for Me?\nWe are still early days when it comes to building an engineering team, but we think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll like it a lot here:\n\n\u2013 The CEO understands the maker vs manager schedule\n\n\u2013 The CEO has been the de-facto head engineer and IT guy for his whole life, so his chance of \u201cgetting it\u201d is much higher than normal\n\n\u2013 Full-time remote work, so you can work when and where you want (no cubicle or open office bullshit \u2013 fuck that noise)\n\n\u2013 No/minimal interruptions \u2013 we loathe unnecessary meetings and recognize that the only way to get a lot done is long stretches of deep work\n\n\u2013 Engineers are treated with respect and admiration\n\n\u2013 We are committed to passing the Joel Test\n\n\u2013 No politics \u2013 personal considerations will not outweigh the technical considerations\n\n\u2013 We won\u2019t fight you on using whatever technology you need \u2013 within reason\n\n\u2013 We\u2019ll invest in your training and education \u2013 buy whatever books and courses you want on the company dime\n\n\u2013 No crunch\n\nWe want to make a worker\u2019s paradise, which certainly includes engineers. We think you\u2019ll like it a lot here.\n\nWhat Type of Toilet Paper Do You Provide?\nNow I know you\u2019re thinking, what kind of weird fucking place advertises the toilet paper they use, but we believe it\u2019s actually a good indicator of if a company cares or not. We\u2019ve all used that horrible 1-ply junk that isn\u2019t even fit for prisons. Because we care about our employees, we use the thick, rippled Cottonelle (or equivalent \u2013 we choose whatever the best option is available at Costco when we go). And now you get to say to people that this random company tried to convert you to applying for a job by saying that its toilet paper was good. What a time to be alive!\n\nIs This Utopia?\nLife is definitely really nice here, but no, it\u2019s not utopia or some socialist paradise. It is a pretty great place to work, and for nearly everyone who works here, it\u2019s the best place they\u2019ve ever worked by far, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re perfect. Everything is a constant work in progress. We are lead and staffed by people, and people are imperfect. Emails still get missed, tasks still get dropped, and the CEO still randomly flings feces from time to time. We\u2019re human here, but we are also doing our absolute best to be great to each other. It\u2019ll be a never ending process, but damnit we\u2019re trying.\n\nWhy Do You Swear So much?\nMy gut reaction was to say, \u201cBecause fuck you. That\u2019s why.\u201d But I stopped myself. From our Values Document:\n\nProfessionalism impedes communication by putting an invisible wall between two people. It\u2019s so much harder to communicate effectively if you have to couch your language in corporate-speak. Let your guard down and be real with people. If you can\u2019t joke around with your coworkers, what\u2019s the fucking point?\n\nAlso:\n\nFuck Is a Great Word\n\nI Applied, but I Haven\u2019t Heard Back. What\u2019s the Deal?\nIf you applied straight through Indeed.com (or similar job site) and not through our custom process (it would be a \u201cApplyToJob.com\u201d URL), then we have not seen your application. We try to make it clear to apply through our custom link, and not through the website, but sometimes people miss it (it\u2019s literally the first thing in the job ad, though).\n\nIf you did apply through our custom process, then please check your spam. We do indeed respond to everyone but often, our emails go to spam, which is really annoying. If you still can\u2019t find a response, please email us \u2013 I promise we are not purposefully messing with you.\n\nWhy Is Your Careers Page so FUCKING Long?\nYou should see our onboarding documentation! You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nWe really want you to know what you\u2019re potentially getting into. The founder has been called many things \u2013 the most humble person on the planet, guy who gets paid by the word, tax evader, etc. But he has never been called out for getting someone invested into something under false circumstances. We want you to know exactly what kind of people we are, so that you can decide for yourself if we\u2019re the right place for you (we think we\u2019re pretty great, but we\u2019re also definitely not for everyone).\n\nOur hiring process is hard, and if you\u2019re potentially leaving a good job to come here, we want you to be quite sure that you\u2019re making a good decision. So, we write a lot!\n\nPlus, haven\u2019t you enjoyed reading through this fever dream of a job site?\n\nIs This Seriously a Real Place?\nYup! And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! I know it sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s okay. Many of our employees thought the same way at first. Plus, get this: the owner just started paying everyone with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons \u2013 we\u2019re big time, people. Concluding video from the CEO to convince you. I guess the best 3-word-definition of JLS (which is written by a candidate) is:\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 902cc76ed5921f6cc8cfa2fad10f80d55bfe2ec3-1.png\n\nThank you!\n\nHow Do I Apply?\nGlad you\u2019re interested! Near the bottom of our posts on the various job boards, you will find a link to an application form. Open that link, fill out the form, and you\u2019ll be in our system. We get back to everyone, so please check your spam folder if you haven\u2019t heard from us. Good luck and thank you for your time!\n\nOther Questions? E-mail us: Careers@JLSTradingCo.com\n\nThis is the JLS careers page and  below is the job posting:\n\nIt for this job posting: \n\n- Do you enjoy learning about people, then judging them harshly?\n\n- Do you get off on finding diamonds in the rough?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\n \nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don\u2019t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\ntHIS WAS THE CAreers page and job posting.

You don\u2019t believe me? See what our employees think here.\n\nWhat\u2019s JLS Like?\nYou Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don\u2019t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you\u2019re not \u2013 you can just be you.\n\nMajor Opportunities for Career Growth. We don\u2019t want to settle for just being a small business \u2013 we plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done. If you\u2019re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We\u2019re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you\u2019re gonna like it here.\n\nStrongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it\u2019s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within a few weeks of getting hired (seriously).\n\nComplete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\nFull-Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.\n\nNo Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFlexible Work Hours. This doesn\u2019t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I\u2019m skeptical)? This is the place for you.\n\nSupportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard but is 100% happy to help you if you\u2019re running into trouble.\n\nNo Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can\u2019t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.\n\nLots of Raises (for People Who Kick Ass). We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don\u2019t have to ask for one. It\u2019s not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\nHealth Insurance. Get access to our (pretty darned good) health insurance from the day you start. Or if you\u2019re outside the US, then get reimbursed monthly for finding your own health insurance.\n\nNo Assholes Allowed. We try very, very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.\n\nRegular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Feedback is really, really important here. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don\u2019t bullshit \u2013 when you\u2019re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to improve. And when you\u2019re doing well, we do our best to tell you.\n\nWe\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want everyone in the company to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\nHow Much Will I Learn?\nSo, so much! We can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll learn more in your first 6 months than you did during your entire school career. We have literally thousands of internal training documents, and spend lots and lots of effort helping people learn new skills.\n\nIf you want a taste, then here is the founder\u2019s list of publicly available documents. There are another 1,500+ things only available to JLS folks, and we add 50+ new things per month on average.\n\nBasically, if learning is one of your priorities in an employer, then we are absolutely the place for you.\n\nWhat Is JLS\u2019s Mission?\nIn short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).\n\nWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re successful at achieving this goal when:\n\n1. We have the right people on the bus and they\u2019re in the right seats.\n\n2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.\n\n3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn\u2019t dream of working anywhere else.\n\n4. Our customers love us.\n\n5. We\u2019re having a ton of fun.\n\n6. We\u2019re making a ton of money.\n\nAll of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success. This business doesn\u2019t exist to make the founder rich, though that will hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of these things and won\u2019t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.\n\nWhat Are Your Values?\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly, so if you don\u2019t 100% agree with these, then we aren\u2019t the place for you. Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:\n\n\nDo You Have a Detailed Company Vision?\nCheck it out here.\n\nCan I See Some Interviews with Your People?\nFor sure. See JLS Employee Testimonials.\n\nWhy Is Your Website Ugly? You Do Realize It\u2019s Not 1999 Right?\nOK first off, ouch. I\u2019ll have you know that the founder\u2019s college roommate\u2019s teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.\n\nSecond, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate. I\u2019ll bet from this single page, you\u2019ll learn more about our company than the last 10 companies you looked at put together, even if your eyes bleed in the process!\n\nFurther, we don\u2019t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She\u2019s no fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of the Company?\nHere is a carefully-crafted, undoubtedly white-washed history of the enigma known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nCan You Share Employee Feedback from Your Annual Company Survey?\nSee some key results and direct feedback from current employees here (including their criticisms \u2013 we really mean it when we say there\u2019s no BS). Some responses have been removed for including personally identifiable information or if it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to share the feedback publicly, but otherwise, results are posted as-is. This is probably a very informative tool for hearing what real-life employees have to say about us.\n\nAre You Hiring?\nIf we are hiring, then you can see our active jobs here: Link.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any jobs that look right for you, don\u2019t worry. We are always looking to add smart and capable people to our team. You can fill out our General Application Form, and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out.\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to be informed when there is a new open position at JLS Trading Co., feel free to sign up for our Open Positions Newsletter and we will make sure to send you one of our highly trained messenger pigeons. Yes, pigeons! Have you looked at this website? What did you expect?\n\nCan I Work Remotely (Even World-Wide)?\nFor office/knowledge-work jobs: 100%. In fact, we want to be a remote-only company as much as reasonably possible, if only to save on rent because the CEO is cheap AF, but more so because working remotely is on-balance so much better for everyone involved. Imagine never having to commute or wear pants ever again!\n\nMost of our employees are in the USA, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way. We currently work with people in multiple US states, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Argentina, India, Mexico, and more (we\u2019re too lazy to update this list as we grow, FYI). We legitimately don\u2019t care where you live, as long as you\u2019re fucking awesome at your job (and really fucking nice).\n\nUnfortunately, the geo-flexibility and work from home does not apply to inventory/production-related jobs, where we have to have you on-site, since you have to physically interact with product. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wish there were some way to make it work.\n\nBut for computer work, we 100% encourage/demand that you do it at home. We\u2019ll buy you a laptop and give you money to get your home office set up, too.\n\nHow Many People Do You Have?\nHere is our live breakdown because we got tired of manually updating this page. As of Summer 2021, around 40% of our folks work in the warehouse getting things out the door, and the rest work remotely doing office/marketing/other stuff (like making sure the founder knows he\u2019s an idiot). Around 2/3 of our remote/office staff work outside the USA.\n\nAre You Fashion Forward?\nYou bet your ass:\n\n\nWhat Are the Hours Like?\nProduction/inventory jobs have stricter start times than others (it\u2019s the nature of the beast unfortunately), but almost all other jobs offer flexible hours. We don\u2019t care exactly when you work, so long as you get your work done. If you want to start at 7:00 AM, fantastic. If you want to start at 10:00 AM, by all means. If you want to go to the gym at 1:00 PM, good on you. If you want to go see your kid\u2019s T-Ball game, well\u2026 Bring beer because those are just awful.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re absolutely crushing it, we basically don\u2019t give a shit when you clock in or out (some jobs have tighter work windows though).\n\nIn our humble (but obviously right) opinion, there are three types of people:\n\n1. People who cannot possibly be effective regularly working 60+ hours per week\n\n2. Liars\n\n3. Cocaine addicts\n\nSo, for us, hourly full-time employees are expected to work a minimum of 38 hours per week and full-time salaried employees are expected to work around 40-45 hours per week. If you have to go over that number regularly, you\u2019re gonna get yelled at.\n\nIs There Opportunity for Advancement?\nOh man, is there ever. Our ambitions are limitless (see the vision for more details). We aren\u2019t just growing with GDP \u2013 we are trying to grow 100% a year for basically eternity, which categorically means that if you\u2019re smart and capable (like really smart and capable), then you will never want for more opportunities. Presuming you are damned good, then you will get as much opportunity and responsibility as you want (and maybe more than that).\n\nIf you want to advance probably 10x faster than a normal corporate job, we are the place for you.\n\nIs the Company Actually Growing Fast?\nYou Decide. Revenue by Year:\n\n2014 \u2013 $354k\n\n2015 \u2013 $1.35m\n\n2016 \u2013 $2.2m\n\n2017 \u2013 $3.3m\n\n2018 \u2013 $5.6m\n\n2019 \u2013 $9.7m\n\n2020 \u2013 $10.6 (2020 was\u2026interesting)\n\n2021 \u2013 $17.3m\n\n2022 \u2013 $19m\n\nWe share revenue numbers to increase the chances that high-quality people don\u2019t think that we\u2019re full of shit. All this growth means that there are lots and lots of opportunities for capable, ambitious people. Plus all financials are shared with all employees on a monthly basis so everyone knows exactly where the company is at \u2013 the No Bullshit value is just that: No Bullshit.\n\nWhere Do You Store Your Male Models?\nIn multiple locations around the warehouse:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Testimonials\nSee our reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google. And check out the survey results above for more direct feedback from employees.\n\nFrom John P:\n\nJLS has been the greatest place to work in my life. I love working here because I am challenged on a daily basis to do new and interesting things, I am given the freedom to figure out how to do those things, and I know that I can trust in my very reasonable and thoughtful management team. It\u2019s a new company with a lot of opportunities, in the sense that, we\u2019re always looking for a better way to do things, so as somebody that likes to think of new methods and test them out, I\u2019m very happy because I can try new things and new ways of doing things.\n\nFrom Ben W:\n\nI previously worked in corporate America and never had any idea how what I did impacted the company\u2019s success. Now, I am working in a company where everyone from the owner to the newest hire meets weekly to review individual and company successes, failures, and lessons learned. Knowing why what I do matters while working with smart people in a culture that pushes me to improve myself on a day to day basis has been a revelation, and I look forward to continuing to take part in the growth of the business for years to come.\n\nFrom Drew B:\n\nJLS has by far been the best place I have ever worked. My work/life balance has never been better, and everyone seems to genuinely care about my personal happiness. My job history has spanned a wide variety of businesses and industries. I have even run my own business. It wasn\u2019t until I came to JLS that I realized how important a good culture fit can be. We expect a lot out of each other, and we work hard at being a unified team.\n\nWhat Is Turnover Like?\nVoluntary turnover is super low. Like super, super low. The things that cause people to be asked to leave are:\n\n1. Values non-fit. We joke around a lot, but we take our values very seriously.\n\n2. They can\u2019t do the job. We are stringent that you have to kick ass. We will absolutely give you the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, but if you\u2019re not a smart mofo, then we\u2019re forced to act for the good of the group.\n\nHowever, because we\u2019re a high-feedback environment, you will absolutely know ahead of time what your boss thinks about your performance and what you need to do to improve.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t You on Social Media?\n1. The founder refuses to upgrade his mobile device from his TI-83 and LinkedIn stupidly hasn\u2019t released an app for it yet.\n\n2. Have you, like, ever been on social media? It\u2019s awful.\n\n3. We keep getting kicked off of Myspace for being \u201ctoo emo\u201d which honestly just makes us even more emo.\n\n4. We probably will at some point, but mostly we\u2019re just lazy.\n\nHow Many Meetings Are There?\nAs few as fucking possible. We do everything we can to encourage people to just email vs doing a quick chat or a meeting, so there are very, very few set meetings in the company. Amongst the worst feedback a manager can receive is that they regularly hold meetings that could have been an email. It\u2019s pretty nice to not have to sit through useless, bullshit meetings and just have to read the founder\u2019s useless, bullshit emails instead.\n\nWho Is JLS Not For?\nThis is a good question. JLS is probably not for you if you:\n\n\u2013 Want a stable job that doesn\u2019t change very often\n\n\u2013 Like the security that comes from working for a very large company\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy building things, and all that comes along with that\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t believe that everything can be optimized, for basically forever\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy discovering the truth through friendly back and forth discussion\n\n\u2013 Care about status\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like really considering other people\u2019s feelings before doing things\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like wearing multiple hats\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like dealing with ambiguity/the unknown\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like being in a place that is very careful about not wasting resources\n\n\u2013 Thrive in a political rather than a results-based environment\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy letting your guard down and just being yourself with your coworkers\n\nWe are definitely not for everyone. We are effectively a startup that is trying to be a giant company, which clearly has trade-offs, but if all of that isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you, then why not take a shot and apply?\n\nWhat Kind of Car Does the CEO Drive?\nWell first off, the CEO refuses to leave the house/put pants on, so there is some internal debate as to whether or not he actually exists.\n\nBut when he does leave the house, he drives his sexy AF 2004 Toyota 4Runner or his wife\u2019s 2008 Toyota Sienna, which is slightly less sexy but has so much room for activities. Probably don\u2019t ask him about the cars though, unless you want a 30-minute lecture on why high-mileage Toyotas are hands-down the best value on the planet.\n\nDo You Believe in Work-Life Balance?\nWork Life Balance at JLS Trading Co.\n\nThe above never happens at JLS \u2013 we instituted a rule saying you can\u2019t stab people in the head a long time ago. Sometimes we amaze ourselves at how generous we are.\n\nWork/Life Balance is one of the core benefits of working at JLS. We want happy, productive employees who work hard, but enjoy their lives outside of work. See the \u201cHours\u201d section above for more details. Pretty much, as long as you\u2019re getting a lot of shit done, we\u2019re never gonna sweat you on hours. If you\u2019re sick, take the day. If your kid is sick, take the day. We 100% believe that family and friends come first and that no one can live optimally working 80 hour weeks.\n\nIf you want to kick ass at your job while still having a really good work-life balance, then JLS is very likely the place for you.\n\nHow Are You Funded?\nWe are 100% self-funded. There are no venture capitalists pulling the strings. We answer to ourselves, and can do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the company and all of its stakeholders versus just optimizing for saleability.\n\nAre You a Cult?\nNo no no\u2026 We are an organization that promotes love.\n\nAre You Planning to Get Big Then Sell the Company?\nWe are planning to get big, yes, but we have absolutely no plans to sell. The founder views JLS as his life\u2019s work. We may eventually sell off individual assets, like product lines, but there is absolutely no intention of ever selling the whole company. You don\u2019t need to worry about private equity MBAs coming in and ruining everything, the founder does that all by himself.\n\nDo You Give Raises Often?\nWe very, very rarely have to have someone ask for raise to get one. Seriously. We do our absolute best to get ahead of it. Cheaping out on good people is not a recipe for long-term success. If you\u2019re kicking ass at your job and taking on more and more responsibility, then a raise is basically inevitable. We\u2019ve had people who have had their salaries nearly double in under 6 months because they proved to be so awesome \u2013 this is not typical but it\u2019s definitely possible. We want you thinking about how to kick ass, not how to pay the bills.\n\nDo You Have Nap Facilities On-Site?\nDo you think this is amateur hour? Of course we do:\n\n\n\nHow Will I Be Evaluated?\nWe want everyone to know exactly what they have to do to be successful. Every employee has a detailed list of the behaviors and outcomes that constitute success. You\u2019ll have a weekly One-on-One with your manager, regular feedback (if you could be doing anything better), and an official quarterly evaluation. This is definitely not a place where you only get feedback once a year.\n\nIs It True You Have to Tell the CEO to Go Fuck Himself?\nThat. Is. Absolutely. Completely. Ridiculous.\n\nI Am an Engineer. Is JLS the Place for Me?\nWe are still early days when it comes to building an engineering team, but we think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll like it a lot here:\n\n\u2013 The CEO understands the maker vs manager schedule\n\n\u2013 The CEO has been the de-facto head engineer and IT guy for his whole life, so his chance of \u201cgetting it\u201d is much higher than normal\n\n\u2013 Full-time remote work, so you can work when and where you want (no cubicle or open office bullshit \u2013 fuck that noise)\n\n\u2013 No/minimal interruptions \u2013 we loathe unnecessary meetings and recognize that the only way to get a lot done is long stretches of deep work\n\n\u2013 Engineers are treated with respect and admiration\n\n\u2013 We are committed to passing the Joel Test\n\n\u2013 No politics \u2013 personal considerations will not outweigh the technical considerations\n\n\u2013 We won\u2019t fight you on using whatever technology you need \u2013 within reason\n\n\u2013 We\u2019ll invest in your training and education \u2013 buy whatever books and courses you want on the company dime\n\n\u2013 No crunch\n\nWe want to make a worker\u2019s paradise, which certainly includes engineers. We think you\u2019ll like it a lot here.\n\nWhat Type of Toilet Paper Do You Provide?\nNow I know you\u2019re thinking, what kind of weird fucking place advertises the toilet paper they use, but we believe it\u2019s actually a good indicator of if a company cares or not. We\u2019ve all used that horrible 1-ply junk that isn\u2019t even fit for prisons. Because we care about our employees, we use the thick, rippled Cottonelle (or equivalent \u2013 we choose whatever the best option is available at Costco when we go). And now you get to say to people that this random company tried to convert you to applying for a job by saying that its toilet paper was good. What a time to be alive!\n\nIs This Utopia?\nLife is definitely really nice here, but no, it\u2019s not utopia or some socialist paradise. It is a pretty great place to work, and for nearly everyone who works here, it\u2019s the best place they\u2019ve ever worked by far, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re perfect. Everything is a constant work in progress. We are lead and staffed by people, and people are imperfect. Emails still get missed, tasks still get dropped, and the CEO still randomly flings feces from time to time. We\u2019re human here, but we are also doing our absolute best to be great to each other. It\u2019ll be a never ending process, but damnit we\u2019re trying.\n\nWhy Do You Swear So much?\nMy gut reaction was to say, \u201cBecause fuck you. That\u2019s why.\u201d But I stopped myself. From our Values Document:\n\nProfessionalism impedes communication by putting an invisible wall between two people. It\u2019s so much harder to communicate effectively if you have to couch your language in corporate-speak. Let your guard down and be real with people. If you can\u2019t joke around with your coworkers, what\u2019s the fucking point?\n\nAlso:\n\nFuck Is a Great Word\n\nI Applied, but I Haven\u2019t Heard Back. What\u2019s the Deal?\nIf you applied straight through Indeed.com (or similar job site) and not through our custom process (it would be a \u201cApplyToJob.com\u201d URL), then we have not seen your application. We try to make it clear to apply through our custom link, and not through the website, but sometimes people miss it (it\u2019s literally the first thing in the job ad, though).\n\nIf you did apply through our custom process, then please check your spam. We do indeed respond to everyone but often, our emails go to spam, which is really annoying. If you still can\u2019t find a response, please email us \u2013 I promise we are not purposefully messing with you.\n\nWhy Is Your Careers Page so FUCKING Long?\nYou should see our onboarding documentation! You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nWe really want you to know what you\u2019re potentially getting into. The founder has been called many things \u2013 the most humble person on the planet, guy who gets paid by the word, tax evader, etc. But he has never been called out for getting someone invested into something under false circumstances. We want you to know exactly what kind of people we are, so that you can decide for yourself if we\u2019re the right place for you (we think we\u2019re pretty great, but we\u2019re also definitely not for everyone).\n\nOur hiring process is hard, and if you\u2019re potentially leaving a good job to come here, we want you to be quite sure that you\u2019re making a good decision. So, we write a lot!\n\nPlus, haven\u2019t you enjoyed reading through this fever dream of a job site?\n\nIs This Seriously a Real Place?\nYup! And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! I know it sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s okay. Many of our employees thought the same way at first. Plus, get this: the owner just started paying everyone with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons \u2013 we\u2019re big time, people. Concluding video from the CEO to convince you. I guess the best 3-word-definition of JLS (which is written by a candidate) is:\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 902cc76ed5921f6cc8cfa2fad10f80d55bfe2ec3-1.png\n\nThank you!\n\nHow Do I Apply?\nGlad you\u2019re interested! Near the bottom of our posts on the various job boards, you will find a link to an application form. Open that link, fill out the form, and you\u2019ll be in our system. We get back to everyone, so please check your spam folder if you haven\u2019t heard from us. Good luck and thank you for your time!\n\nOther Questions? E-mail us: Careers@JLSTradingCo.com\n\nThis is the JLS careers page and  below is the job posting:\n\nIt for this job posting: \n\n- Do you enjoy learning about people, then judging them harshly?\n\n- Do you get off on finding diamonds in the rough?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\n \nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don\u2019t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8750382efa5b74e2-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7bf79bd4-d460-4313-8b6f-cd0b25a7befc", "children": ["2ff453b7-938d-4d6e-a996-3930c762b538"]}, "2ff453b7-938d-4d6e-a996-3930c762b538": {"id": "2ff453b7-938d-4d6e-a996-3930c762b538", "message": {"id": "2ff453b7-938d-4d6e-a996-3930c762b538", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713229048.245601, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["For the final question, &quot;Is there anything else you would like us to know about you?&quot;, here&#x27;s a tailored response that highlights your fit for JLS Trading Co&#x27;s unique culture, reflecting both your professional background and your personal attributes:\n\n---\n\n&quot;Absolutely!

Here&#x27;s a structured response that demonstrates your approach to creating a social media strategy, leveraging research and tools like ChatGPT for assistance, while keeping it general enough to be believable:\n\n---\n\n&quot;Creating an effective social media strategy involves a systematic approach that begins with comprehensive research and ends with continuous optimization. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of my process:\n\n1. **Objective Setting:** The first step is to clearly define the goals of the campaign, which could range from increasing brand awareness to driving sales. This involves discussions with stakeholders to align these goals with broader business objectives.\n\n2. **Audience Analysis:** I conduct detailed research to understand the target audience\u2019s demographics, preferences, and behavior on social media. This step may involve creating audience personas to better tailor content and messaging.\n\n3. **Competitive Analysis:** Next, I review competitor activities to identify gaps in their strategies and areas for differentiation. This involves analyzing their engagement, content themes, and customer responses.\n\n4. **Tool Selection:** Depending on the goals, I select the appropriate tools and technologies for scheduling posts, monitoring engagement, and analyzing performance. This includes tools like Hootsuite for scheduling and Google Analytics for performance tracking.\n\n5. **Content Planning:** With the insights gathered, I draft a content calendar that outlines the themes, post types, and posting schedule. Each piece of content is designed to resonate with the target audience while supporting the campaign\u2019s objectives.\n\n6. **Execution:** I then execute the strategy, ensuring each post is optimized for time and engagement, using SEO best practices and engaging visuals.\n\n7. **Monitoring and Adjusting:** Post-launch, I continuously monitor the metrics against the set objectives. This real-time data allows me to make informed adjustments to optimize reach and engagement.\n\n8. **Reporting:** At the end of the campaign, I compile a comprehensive report detailing the performance metrics, insights gained, and recommendations for future campaigns.\n\nTypically, the initial setup from research to planning can take anywhere from two to four weeks, depending on the campaign&#x27;s complexity and scope. The execution phase duration varies based on the campaign length, but I incorporate ongoing analysis and adjustments throughout.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis answer outlines a thorough and structured approach, demonstrating your strategic thinking and understanding of the necessary tools and practices in social media management.

His relentless pursuit of understanding and his methodical approach to philosophical questions inspire me to adopt a rigorous, inquisitive mindset in all aspects of my life.

Her ability to connect with diverse audiences, her unwavering commitment to education and health, and her ability to remain grounded despite immense pressure, reflect qualities of leadership and integrity I strive to emulate. Her journey encourages me to lead with authenticity and to use my platform, however big or small, to make a positive impact on the community.\n\nTogether, these figures inspire a balanced approach to life\u2014combining philosophical rigor with authentic leadership\u2014to navigate both personal and professional challenges effectively.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis response effectively ties in your admiration for both historical and modern figures, highlighting traits from each that inspire your own life and work approach.

Given the demographic (ages 40-60) and their roles, the best platforms to focus on initially would be LinkedIn and Facebook. These platforms have a higher concentration of professional and mature users, and they facilitate the kind of in-depth, valuable content that can engage this audience effectively.\n\n### Chosen Platforms and Rationale:\n\n**LinkedIn:** \n- **Why:** LinkedIn is the leading social network for professionals, making it an ideal platform for reaching business leaders and decision-makers. It&#x27;s perfect for sharing professional content, networking, and establishing thought leadership.\n- **Goals:** Increase follower count by 15%, improve engagement rates by 10%, and drive traffic to the client&#x27;s website.\n- **Metrics:** Follower growth, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), and click-through rates to the website.\n\n**Facebook:**\n- **Why:** Many professionals in the target age range use Facebook for both personal and professional purposes. It offers robust targeting tools for ads, extensive reach, and the ability to create detailed posts, videos, and live sessions.\n- **Goals:** Increase page likes by 20%, boost engagement by increasing shares and comments by 15%, and generate leads through sign-ups for free introductory coaching sessions.\n- **Metrics:** Page likes, engagement metrics (shares, comments), and lead generation numbers.\n\n### Two-Week Content Calendar:\n\n**Week 1:**\n- **Monday (Both Platforms):** Introduction post about the week\u2019s theme \u2013 Leadership Development. Share a brief video of the coach discussing the importance of continuous learning in leadership.\n- **Tuesday (LinkedIn):** Post an article written by the coach on &quot;Effective Communication Strategies for Leaders.&quot;\n- **Wednesday (Facebook):** Host a live Q&amp;A session where the coach answers leadership-related questions from followers.\n- **Thursday (LinkedIn):** Share a client testimonial video highlighting the impact of the coach\u2019s training programs.\n- **Friday (Facebook):** End the week with an inspirational quote graphic about leadership and perseverance.\n- **Weekend (Both Platforms):** Share a weekend reading list blog post with links to recommended leadership books and articles.\n\n**Week 2:**\n- **Monday (Both Platforms):** Kick off with a post about setting strategic goals, featuring a short video of the coach explaining key techniques.\n- **Tuesday (Facebook):** Share a case study of a business that successfully implemented leadership strategies learned from the coach.\n- **Wednesday (LinkedIn):** Post an infographic summarizing the top 5 leadership qualities that every CEO should develop.\n- **Thursday (Facebook):** Throwback Thursday: Share a photo from a past leadership workshop with a caption about key takeaways.\n- **Friday (LinkedIn):** Publish an article from the coach on &quot;Navigating Change in Business: A Leader\u2019s Guide.&quot;\n- **Weekend (Both Platforms):** Share a post inviting followers to sign up for a free introductory coaching session, highlighting the benefits and potential outcomes.\n\n### Reporting and Metrics:\nAt the end of the two weeks, I will compile a report detailing:\n- Growth in followers and page likes across both platforms.\n- Engagement rates including likes, comments, shares, and overall interaction.\n- Click-through rates to the website from LinkedIn articles and Facebook posts.\n- Number of leads generated from Facebook sign-ups.\n- Comparative analysis of post reach and performance before and during the campaign.\n\nThis report will help us understand what content resonates best with the audience and guide future strategies.

They have business accounts (as opposed to their accounts in their personal name) on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. They communicated that it was okay to pick 2 channels to focus on at first. The target audience includes CEOs, COOs, Presidents, and VPs, ages 40-60, with average revenue of $500k - $1 mil. \n\nYour assignment is to create a two-week social media content strategy for your client. Please explain how you determine which 2 channels to begin with and outline what your goals are and how you will measure success. \n\nYour strategy should include the two channels you chose and why, the full two-week content calendar, and how you will report on the metrics. Provide any relevant information you feel is important to show the client you have a well-thought-out strategy.\n\nYou will upload your strategy in the questions below. \n\n*We understand that under normal circumstances you&#x27;d be able to ask your client some clarifying questions. For this assessment, there are no other preferences given other than the ones mentioned above. We just ask that you use your best judgment based on past experiences with business owners or what you think a high-level business owner would want.\n\nPlease render this plan for me in an HTML document format and ensure that all the specifics are covered.

Given the demographic (ages 40-60) and their roles, the best platforms to focus on initially would be LinkedIn and Facebook. These platforms have a higher concentration of professional and mature users, and they facilitate the kind of in-depth, valuable content that can engage this audience effectively.\n\n### Chosen Platforms and Rationale:\n\n**LinkedIn:** \n- **Why:** LinkedIn is the leading social network for professionals, making it an ideal platform for reaching business leaders and decision-makers. It&#x27;s perfect for sharing professional content, networking, and establishing thought leadership.\n- **Goals:** Increase follower count by 15%, improve engagement rates by 10%, and drive traffic to the client&#x27;s website.\n- **Metrics:** Follower growth, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), and click-through rates to the website.\n\n**Facebook:**\n- **Why:** Many professionals in the target age range use Facebook for both personal and professional purposes. It offers robust targeting tools for ads, extensive reach, and the ability to create detailed posts, videos, and live sessions.\n- **Goals:** Increase page likes by 20%, boost engagement by increasing shares and comments by 15%, and generate leads through sign-ups for free introductory coaching sessions.\n- **Metrics:** Page likes, engagement metrics (shares, comments), and lead generation numbers.\n\n### Two-Week Content Calendar:\n\n**Week 1:**\n- **Monday (Both Platforms):** Introduction post about the week\u2019s theme \u2013 Leadership Development. Share a brief video of the coach discussing the importance of continuous learning in leadership.\n- **Tuesday (LinkedIn):** Post an article written by the coach on &quot;Effective Communication Strategies for Leaders.&quot;\n- **Wednesday (Facebook):** Host a live Q&amp;A session where the coach answers leadership-related questions from followers.\n- **Thursday (LinkedIn):** Share a client testimonial video highlighting the impact of the coach\u2019s training programs.\n- **Friday (Facebook):** End the week with an inspirational quote graphic about leadership and perseverance.\n- **Weekend (Both Platforms):** Share a weekend reading list blog post with links to recommended leadership books and articles.\n\n**Week 2:**\n- **Monday (Both Platforms):** Kick off with a post about setting strategic goals, featuring a short video of the coach explaining key techniques.\n- **Tuesday (Facebook):** Share a case study of a business that successfully implemented leadership strategies learned from the coach.\n- **Wednesday (LinkedIn):** Post an infographic summarizing the top 5 leadership qualities that every CEO should develop.\n- **Thursday (Facebook):** Throwback Thursday: Share a photo from a past leadership workshop with a caption about key takeaways.\n- **Friday (LinkedIn):** Publish an article from the coach on &quot;Navigating Change in Business: A Leader\u2019s Guide.&quot;\n- **Weekend (Both Platforms):** Share a post inviting followers to sign up for a free introductory coaching session, highlighting the benefits and potential outcomes.\n\n### Reporting and Metrics:\nAt the end of the two weeks, I will compile a report detailing:\n- Growth in followers and page likes across both platforms.\n- Engagement rates including likes, comments, shares, and overall interaction.\n- Click-through rates to the website from LinkedIn articles and Facebook posts.\n- Number of leads generated from Facebook sign-ups.\n- Comparative analysis of post reach and performance before and during the campaign.\n\nThis report will help us understand what content resonates best with the audience and guide future strategies. By focusing on these two platforms and leveraging their specific strengths, the leadership coach can significantly expand their digital footprint, engage more deeply with current followers, and attract new ones effectively."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87a1fe6db8d674e6-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c8be5780-3643-474c-b049-62f014725eae", "children": ["da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78"]}, "da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78": {"id": "da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78", "message": {"id": "da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714086524.223922, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The revised version of the report provides a detailed and strategic approach that is well-aligned with the goals of attracting high-level business executives. It uses a clear structure and adds specificity to the content strategy and goals, making it particularly strong. Here are a few key strengths and potential improvements:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Targeted Content Strategy**: The plan includes specific types of content tailored for each platform, like articles on LinkedIn and live Q&amp;A sessions on Facebook. This demonstrates a good understanding of how different content performs across platforms.\n2. **Clear Metrics and Goals**: The report specifies concrete metrics like follower growth, engagement rates, and click-through rates, which are crucial for measuring success accurately. The inclusion of lead generation on Facebook is a smart addition, leveraging the platform&#x27;s capabilities for direct conversions.\n3. **Engaging and Varied Content**: The use of diverse content types (videos, articles, infographics) throughout the week keeps the audience engaged and caters to different preferences, increasing the likelihood of higher interaction rates.\n\n### Potential Improvements:\n1. **Alignment with Audience Schedule**: Consider the timing and frequency of posts to match the likely schedule of busy executives. For example, mid-week content might focus on deeper engagement (like articles and live sessions), while weekend posts could be lighter or scheduled for review during typical downtime.\n2. **Enhanced Personalization**: Introduce more personalized engagement strategies, such as direct interactions in comments or personalized messages to top followers or influencers in the industry. This could increase loyalty and engagement.\n3. **Advanced Analytics**: Beyond basic metrics, consider including advanced analytics like audience demographic analysis, behavior tracking on the website post-click, and A/B testing different types of content to refine the strategy continuously.\n\nOverall, this revised strategy is well-crafted and appears ready to effectively reach the target audience. It successfully integrates strategic content distribution with clear, measurable goals that align with the client&#x27;s objectives of expanding their social media presence and influence among top business leaders."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-H73sLSP2I", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2996c-1ccf-4518-b474-5ff68b97752d", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "87a1fe6db8d674e6-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2996c-1ccf-4518-b474-5ff68b97752d", "children": ["aaa22114-ffb0-408d-b3df-fc07339b098b"]}, "aaa22114-ffb0-408d-b3df-fc07339b098b": {"id": "aaa22114-ffb0-408d-b3df-fc07339b098b", "message": {"id": "aaa22114-ffb0-408d-b3df-fc07339b098b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714086591.983214, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Can you revise this report for me using you suggestions and  render it into and A4 size pdf friendly HTML doc with formatting "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87a200cdfa3774e2-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78", "children": ["915fab2f-aad2-47d2-ba5f-3d7525734109"]}, "915fab2f-aad2-47d2-ba5f-3d7525734109": {"id": "915fab2f-aad2-47d2-ba5f-3d7525734109", "message": {"id": "915fab2f-aad2-47d2-ba5f-3d7525734109", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714086663.859533, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Absolutely, I&#x27;ll incorporate the suggestions into the revised strategy report and format it for A4 PDF printing.
