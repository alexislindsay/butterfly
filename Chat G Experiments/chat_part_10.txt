Let\u2019s systematically troubleshoot the problem. The most likely issues could be:\n\n1. **Incorrect API Endpoint URL**\n2. **Network Blocking/Firewall Issues**\n3. **Model Availability and Permissions**\n4. **API Key Issues or Usage Limits**\n\nLet\u2019s address each one to see where the problem might be.\n\n### Double-Check Endpoint URL:\nThe correct endpoint URL for calling the OpenAI API to get completions is:\n```plaintext\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/completions\n```\n\n### Test a Simple PowerShell Example:\nHere&#x27;s a simplified version of the PowerShell script, with extra logging and tweaks to help diagnose what&#x27;s happening:\n\n```powershell\n# Your OpenAI API Key\n$apiKey = &quot;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&quot;\n# Correct OpenAI API endpoint\n$url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/completions&quot;\n\n# Headers required for the request\n$headers = @{\n    &quot;Authorization&quot; = &quot;Bearer $apiKey&quot;\n    &quot;Content-Type&quot; = &quot;application/json&quot;\n}\n\n# Body of the request\n$body = @{\n    model = &quot;text-davinci-003&quot;\n    prompt = &quot;What&#x27;s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?&quot;\n    max_tokens = 50\n} | ConvertTo-Json\n\n# Debugging: Print out headers and body\nWrite-Host &quot;Headers: &quot; $headers\nWrite-Host &quot;Body: &quot; $body\n\ntry {\n    # Making the REST API call\n    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body\n    # Outputting the result\n    $response.choices[0].text\n} catch {\n    Write-Host &quot;Error Occurred: $($_.Exception.Message)&quot;\n    Write-Host &quot;Status Code: $($_.Exception.Response.StatusCode.Value__)&quot;\n    Write-Host &quot;Detailed Error: $($_.Exception.Response.StatusDescription)&quot;\n}\n```\n\n### Things to Look For:\n1. **Correct API URL**:\n   - Make sure there is no typo.\n   - The correct endpoint is `https://api.openai.com/v1/completions`.\n\n2. **Check for Network or Firewall Restrictions**:\n   - Sometimes, local firewalls or network restrictions might prevent outgoing connections to certain servers.\n   - You can try testing the endpoint in another environment or machine, or use a tool like **Postman** to see if the API endpoint is reachable from there.\n\n3. **OpenAI API Key Permissions**:\n   - Verify that your OpenAI API key is active and has the permissions to access the model (`text-davinci-003`).\n   - Ensure that there are no usage limits on your account that might be preventing the request.\n\n4. **Use Postman for Testing**:\n   - Try making the same API call using **Postman** to see if the request succeeds. If it works in Postman, the issue is likely with PowerShell, the network, or the machine\u2019s configuration.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Use CURL for Quick Tests**:\n   - Another way to quickly verify the request is to use **curl** in your terminal, like so:\n   ```bash\n   curl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \\\n     -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\\n     -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer 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&quot; \\\n     -d &#x27;{\n       &quot;model&quot;: &quot;text-davinci-003&quot;,\n       &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;What&#x27;s the weather in Seattle tomorrow?&quot;,\n       &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 50\n     }&#x27;\n   ```\n   - If **curl** works, you know the endpoint is accessible and that the issue may be PowerShell-specific.\n\n### Error Analysis:\n- The **404 Not Found** error often means that the server didn\u2019t recognize the endpoint.\n  - Double-check that there isn\u2019t an issue with an extra `/` at the end of the URL.\n  - Make sure you are not missing any required parameters or headers.\n\nPlease give this a try and see if it provides more insight into the issue. If you still encounter problems, please share the updated error message, and we can continue troubleshooting together!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Let\u2019s break down possible reasons and solutions:\n\n### Possible Causes of a 429 Error Despite 0 Recorded Requests:\n1. **API Key Issue**:\n   - Make sure your API key is active and has the correct permissions.\n   - Sometimes new API keys may have a delay before becoming active, or there may be an issue with your subscription.\n\n2. **Incorrect Model or Endpoint**:\n   - Ensure the model you&#x27;re using (`gpt-4o-mini`) is available for your account. It might be a typo or not included in your subscription.\n   - Try switching to a model that you know for sure is available (e.g., `&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;`).\n\n3. **Account Activation**:\n   - If your account is newly created, make sure all requirements (e.g., payment information) are set up properly.\n   - Sometimes, API keys from accounts that haven\u2019t verified billing information may not work properly.\n\n4. **Invalid API Key Format**:\n   - Double-check if the API key is correct and is formatted without extra spaces or line breaks.\n\n5. **Internal OpenAI Quota Management**:\n   - OpenAI may enforce specific limits on certain models or configurations, especially for new users or if usage terms have changed recently.\n\n### Suggested Troubleshooting Steps:\n\n1. **Try a Known Model and Modify the Request**:\n   - Modify the model name to one that is known to be generally available, like `&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;`.\n\n   Here is an updated PowerShell script using a more common model:\n\n   ```powershell\n   # Using your provided OpenAI API key\n   $apiKey = &quot;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&quot;\n   $url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions&quot;\n\n   # Set up the headers\n   $headers = @{\n       &quot;Authorization&quot; = &quot;Bearer $apiKey&quot;\n       &quot;Content-Type&quot;  = &quot;application/json&quot;\n   }\n\n   # Create the body of the request\n   $body = @{\n       model = &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;  # A more commonly available model\n       messages = @(@{\n           role = &quot;user&quot;\n           content = &quot;Say this is a test!&quot;\n       })\n       temperature = 0.7\n   } | ConvertTo-Json\n\n   # Making the API request\n   try {\n       $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body\n       # Output the response from the API\n       $response.choices[0].message.content\n   } catch {\n       # Handle and display errors if the request fails\n       Write-Host &quot;Error Occurred: $($_.Exception.Message)&quot;\n       if ($_.Exception.Response) {\n           Write-Host &quot;Status Code: $($_.Exception.Response.StatusCode.Value__)&quot;\n           Write-Host &quot;Detailed Error: $($_.Exception.Response.StatusDescription)&quot;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Test the Key in Postman**:\n   - Use **Postman** to send a POST request with the same key, headers, and body.\n   - If you get a similar error, it confirms that the issue is with the account or API key itself rather than the script.\n\n3. **Create a New API Key**:\n   - Generate a new API key from the OpenAI [API key management page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and try again.\n\n4. **Contact OpenAI Support**:\n   - If none of these solutions work, it might be a backend issue with OpenAI. You could contact [OpenAI Support](https://help.openai.com/) to verify if there are any issues with your API access.\n\n### Summary:\n- Use a **more commonly available model** like `&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;` to rule out model-specific issues.\n- **Test your API key** in Postman.\n- Consider **generating a new API key**.\n- **Contact OpenAI Support** if issues persist.\n\nLet me know if these steps help or if the error still persists after trying them."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

OpenAI Account Status:\n- **Verify Account Status**: Ensure that your account has an active payment method, is in good standing, and that there are no issues with the subscription tier you&#x27;re on. OpenAI might enforce different limits on accounts without verified billing information.\n- **Check API Key**: If you have other API keys associated with the same account, ensure none of them are currently hitting the rate limit.\n\n### 2. Use a Different Endpoint or Model:\n- **Different Model**: Try switching to another common model. If `&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;` still gives you a 429 error, try `&quot;text-davinci-003&quot;` to see if there&#x27;s a difference.\n  \n  Here is the updated script for `&quot;text-davinci-003&quot;`:\n  ```powershell\n  # Using your provided OpenAI API key\n  $apiKey = &quot;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&quot;\n  $url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/completions&quot;\n\n  # Set up the headers\n  $headers = @{\n      &quot;Authorization&quot; = &quot;Bearer $apiKey&quot;\n      &quot;Content-Type&quot;  = &quot;application/json&quot;\n  }\n\n  # Create the body of the request\n  $body = @{\n      model = &quot;text-davinci-003&quot;\n      prompt = &quot;Say this is a test!&quot;\n      max_tokens = 50\n      temperature = 0.7\n  } | ConvertTo-Json\n\n  try {\n      # Making the API call\n      $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body\n      # Output the response from the API\n      $response.choices[0].text\n  } catch {\n      # Handle and display errors if the request fails\n      Write-Host &quot;Error Occurred: $($_.Exception.Message)&quot;\n      if ($_.Exception.Response) {\n          Write-Host &quot;Status Code: $($_.Exception.Response.StatusCode.Value__)&quot;\n          Write-Host &quot;Detailed Error: $($_.Exception.Response.StatusDescription)&quot;\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### 3. OpenAI Rate Limit for New Users or Specific Models:\n- **New User Limitations**: Sometimes OpenAI may impose stricter rate limits on new accounts. If your account is new, you might be restricted to a very low number of requests per minute/hour.\n- **Restricted Models**: Models like `&quot;gpt-4o-mini&quot;` might have additional restrictions on their usage or availability depending on your plan.\n\n### 4. API Key Permissions:\n- **API Key Scope**: Double-check if your API key has the permissions to use the model you&#x27;re trying to access. Visit the [OpenAI API key management page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and confirm your key permissions.\n  \n### 5. Try Curl Instead:\n- **Curl Command**: To verify if PowerShell might be causing the issue, try running the equivalent **curl** command in your terminal (Command Prompt or Git Bash).\n  \n  Replace `$OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key:\n  ```sh\n  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\\n    -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\\n    -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer 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&quot; \\\n    -d &#x27;{\n      &quot;model&quot;: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n      &quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Say this is a test!&quot;}],\n      &quot;temperature&quot;: 0.7\n    }&#x27;\n  ```\n\n  This will help confirm if the issue is specific to PowerShell.\n\n### 6. Contact OpenAI Support:\n- **Raise a Ticket**: If none of the above methods work, it&#x27;s best to contact OpenAI&#x27;s [support team](https://help.openai.com/). Provide them with the details of your API key, account status, and the issues you&#x27;ve been encountering.\n- **Reference the 429 Error**: Mention that you\u2019re getting a 429 error even though your usage is 0, which may be a back-end limitation or an issue specific to your account setup.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Retry with `&quot;text-davinci-003&quot;`** or another common model.\n- **Run the cURL command** to see if it&#x27;s PowerShell causing the issue.\n- **Contact OpenAI Support** if the problem persists, as they can look into your account directly and clarify any limits or issues.\n\nLet me know how it goes after trying these steps!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

After that, you will need to add a payment method to continue making API requests.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Your **ChatGPT Plus** subscription benefits are limited to using the ChatGPT product itself, not the API.\n- Your **$5 of API credits** are provided by OpenAI for API calls but are not part of the Plus plan. These credits are meant to help you experiment with the API.\n\nIf you want to make **API requests** beyond those $5 credits, you will need to add a **payment method** and pay for the usage based on OpenAI&#x27;s current pricing for the different models and usage tiers.\n\nYou can check the pricing here: [OpenAI API Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) \n\nLet me know if you need more clarification!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Let\u2019s break down how you can run this properly:\n\n### Steps to Run OpenAI API Call with Node.js\n\n1. **Install Node.js**:\n   - If you haven&#x27;t installed **Node.js**, download and install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).\n   - Make sure **npm** is also installed, which comes with Node.js.\n\n2. **Create a New JavaScript File**:\n   - Create a new file in your directory named `openai_request.js` (you can use any name, but it must have `.js` extension).\n\n3. **Install the OpenAI SDK**:\n   - Run the following command in PowerShell to install the **OpenAI SDK**:\n     ```powershell\n     npm install openai\n     ```\n\n4. **Write the Node.js Code**:\n   - Write the code for calling the OpenAI API in the `openai_request.js` file. Here&#x27;s how it should look:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Import the OpenAI package\n   import { OpenAI } from &#x27;openai&#x27;;\n\n   // Initialize the OpenAI instance with your API key\n   const openai = new OpenAI({\n       apiKey: &#x27;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&#x27;\n   });\n\n   // Create an async function to call the OpenAI API\n   async function getCompletion() {\n       try {\n           const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n               model: &#x27;gpt-4&#x27;,\n               messages: [\n                   { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;write a haiku about ai&quot; }\n               ]\n           });\n           console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);\n       } catch (error) {\n           console.error(&quot;Error: &quot;, error);\n       }\n   }\n\n   // Call the function\n   getCompletion();\n   ```\n\n5. **Run the JavaScript File**:\n   - Open **PowerShell**, navigate to the directory where `openai_request.js` is saved, and run:\n     ```powershell\n     node openai_request.js\n     ```\n\n### Key Differences &amp; Tips:\n\n1. **Running JavaScript in Node.js, not PowerShell**:\n   - The code you&#x27;ve written is **JavaScript** and needs to run using **Node.js**, not PowerShell. PowerShell doesn&#x27;t recognize JavaScript imports or async functions.\n\n2. **JavaScript File (`.js`) vs PowerShell**:\n   - You need to save the JavaScript code in a `.js` file and execute it with **Node.js** using the `node` command.\n\n3. **OpenAI Node Library**:\n   - The OpenAI Node SDK requires ES6 module syntax. Therefore, you have to use `import` and have the `type` set to `module` in your **package.json** file if necessary.\n   - Alternatively, you can use `require()` if you prefer CommonJS:\n     ```javascript\n     const { OpenAI } = require(&#x27;openai&#x27;);\n     ```\n\n### Example Using CommonJS if Needed:\nIf you face compatibility issues with ES6 syntax, you can try this version:\n\n1. Install the OpenAI library:\n   ```powershell\n   npm install openai\n   ```\n\n2. Write JavaScript code (`openai_request.js`) like this:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(&#x27;openai&#x27;);\n\n   const configuration = new Configuration({\n       apiKey: &#x27;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&#x27;\n   });\n   const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\n   async function getCompletion() {\n       try {\n           const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n               model: &#x27;gpt-3.5-turbo&#x27;,  // Switch model if needed\n               messages: [\n                   { role: &#x27;user&#x27;, content: &#x27;write a haiku about AI&#x27; }\n               ]\n           });\n           console.log(response.data.choices[0].message.content);\n       } catch (error) {\n           console.error(&quot;Error: &quot;, error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);\n       }\n   }\n\n   getCompletion();\n   ```\n\n### Summary:\n- **Install Node.js** and the **OpenAI library** using `npm install openai`.\n- **Write and run JavaScript code** in `.js` files using **Node.js**, not directly in PowerShell.\n- If you get errors related to the `import` syntax, you can switch to `require()` and use CommonJS.\n\nTry these steps, and let me know if you run into any other issues.

You can create a `.js` file using **PowerShell**. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Steps to Create a `.js` File Using PowerShell\n\n1. **Open PowerShell**.\n\n2. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory**:\n   - You can navigate to the directory where you want to create the `.js` file using the `cd` command. For example:\n     ```powershell\n     cd C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\n     ```\n\n3. **Create a New JavaScript File**:\n   - To create a new file, use the following command:\n     ```powershell\n     New-Item -Path . -Name &quot;openai_request.js&quot; -ItemType &quot;file&quot;\n     ```\n   - This will create an empty JavaScript file named `openai_request.js` in the current directory.\n\n4. **Open the File in a Text Editor**:\n   - You can use **Notepad** to edit the file. Just type:\n     ```powershell\n     notepad openai_request.js\n     ```\n   - **Notepad** will open, allowing you to write or paste the JavaScript code.\n\n5. **Save the File**:\n   - After pasting or writing the JavaScript code, save the file in **Notepad** by clicking **File &gt; Save** or using `Ctrl + S`.\n\n6. **Run the JavaScript File**:\n   - Once you&#x27;ve saved the JavaScript file, you can run it using **Node.js** by executing:\n     ```powershell\n     node openai_request.js\n     ```\n\n### Example:\nHere is an example of creating and editing the JavaScript file:\n\n1. **Create the File**:\n   ```powershell\n   New-Item -Path . -Name &quot;openai_request.js&quot; -ItemType &quot;file&quot;\n   ```\n\n2. **Open and Edit**:\n   ```powershell\n   notepad openai_request.js\n   ```\n\n   Paste the following JavaScript code in **Notepad**:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(&#x27;openai&#x27;);\n\n   const configuration = new Configuration({\n       apiKey: &#x27;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&#x27;\n   });\n   const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\n   async function getCompletion() {\n       try {\n           const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n               model: &#x27;gpt-3.5-turbo&#x27;,\n               messages: [\n                   { role: &#x27;user&#x27;, content: &#x27;write a haiku about AI&#x27; }\n               ]\n           });\n           console.log(response.data.choices[0].message.content);\n       } catch (error) {\n           console.error(&quot;Error: &quot;, error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);\n       }\n   }\n\n   getCompletion();\n   ```\n\n3. **Save and Run the File**:\n   - **Save** the file in **Notepad**.\n   - Then, go back to **PowerShell** and run the script:\n     ```powershell\n     node openai_request.js\n     ```\n\n### Summary:\n- You can create and edit `.js` files directly from **PowerShell**.\n- **Use `New-Item` to create the file** and then **Notepad** (or any text editor) to edit it.\n- Finally, **run** the script using **Node.js** with `node openai_request.js`.\n\nThis workflow lets you create, edit, and execute JavaScript code efficiently using **PowerShell** and **Node.js**.

The error `Configuration is not a constructor` is usually related to mismatched versions or improper imports. Let\u2019s try a different approach to get past this.\n\n### Steps to Fix the Issue:\n\n1. **Confirm the Correct Version of the OpenAI Package**:\n   - The latest OpenAI Node.js library (v4.x) has slightly different usage patterns. You might be following the older documentation while using a newer version of the library.\n   - Let\u2019s try downgrading to a version that matches the code we provided:\n     ```powershell\n     npm uninstall openai\n     npm install openai@3.2.1\n     ```\n   - This version should match the code and use the `Configuration` and `OpenAIApi` constructors correctly.\n\n2. **Correct JavaScript Code for OpenAI Library Version 4.x (If You Want to Keep It Updated)**:\n   If you want to stick with the latest version (v4.x), the library has changed the way you interact with it. Here is the updated JavaScript code that matches **version 4.x**:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import { OpenAI } from &quot;openai&quot;;\n\n   const openai = new OpenAI({\n     apiKey: &#x27;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&#x27;\n   });\n\n   async function getCompletion() {\n     try {\n       const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n         model: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n         messages: [{ role: &quot;user&quot;, content: &quot;Write a haiku about AI&quot; }],\n       });\n\n       console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);\n     } catch (error) {\n       console.error(&quot;Error: &quot;, error);\n     }\n   }\n\n   getCompletion();\n   ```\n\n   - **Note**: If you use the latest `import` syntax, make sure to add `&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;` in your `package.json` file to enable ES6 modules:\n     ```json\n     {\n       &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Install Required Dependencies**:\n   - To use the new code, make sure to install the OpenAI library with:\n     ```powershell\n     npm install openai\n     ```\n\n4. **Run the Script**:\n   - Save the updated file and run it again:\n     ```powershell\n     node openai_request.js\n     ```\n\n### Summary:\n- **Option 1**: Downgrade to OpenAI v3.2.1 using:\n  ```powershell\n  npm install openai@3.2.1\n  ```\n  Then try running the previous version of the code I provided.\n\n- **Option 2**: Update the JavaScript code to the latest format, ensuring you use `&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;` in your `package.json` if using ES6 `import` statements.\n\nI hope one of these solutions works for you! I understand how challenging these setup issues can be, but I&#x27;m confident we can solve this together.

It\u2019s possible that either there&#x27;s a syntax issue or something else going wrong.\n\n### Step-by-Step Debugging:\n1. **Uninstall the Current OpenAI Version**:\n   Just to make sure we&#x27;re not running into version conflicts, let&#x27;s completely uninstall the existing package and reinstall the appropriate version.\n\n   ```powershell\n   npm uninstall openai\n   ```\n\n2. **Install a Known Working Version**:\n   Install version **3.2.1** of the `openai` package, which has a stable API:\n   ```powershell\n   npm install openai@3.2.1\n   ```\n\n3. **Rewrite the JavaScript Code**:\n   The following script should work well with **version 3.2.1**. This version is compatible with the older API method using `Configuration` and `OpenAIApi`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require(&#x27;openai&#x27;);\n\n   // Set up configuration with your API key\n   const configuration = new Configuration({\n       apiKey: &#x27;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&#x27;,\n   });\n\n   // Create OpenAI API instance\n   const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\n   // Define an async function to get a chat completion\n   async function getCompletion() {\n       try {\n           const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({\n               model: &#x27;gpt-3.5-turbo&#x27;,\n               messages: [\n                   { role: &#x27;user&#x27;, content: &#x27;Write a haiku about AI&#x27; }\n               ],\n           });\n\n           // Log the response content\n           console.log(response.data.choices[0].message.content);\n       } catch (error) {\n           console.error(&quot;Error: &quot;, error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);\n       }\n   }\n\n   // Run the function\n   getCompletion();\n   ```\n\n### Important Checks:\n- **Node.js Version**: You are using **Node.js v20.18.0**, which is quite recent. This should work fine with OpenAI SDK, but if there are compatibility issues, you may want to try a stable LTS version of **Node.js**, like **v18.x** or **v16.x**.\n- **Common Errors to Look Out For**:\n  - If `Configuration` is **still** throwing a constructor error, it may indicate a syntax error or an incompatible library version. Make sure you completely uninstalled the previous version and installed `3.2.1`.\n  - If there is still an issue, I recommend testing the script in a new, clean project folder.\n\n### Additional Debugging:\n1. **Confirm the Version**:\n   - Run the following command to confirm you have the correct version of the library installed:\n     ```powershell\n     npm list openai\n     ```\n   - Make sure it shows **openai@3.2.1**.\n\n2. **Run a Simple Test**:\n   - To make sure there&#x27;s no syntax or other library issue, you can add a simple log statement in your code:\n     ```javascript\n     console.log(&#x27;OpenAI instance created successfully&#x27;);\n     ```\n   - Place this right after the `OpenAIApi` instantiation to ensure the configuration and instantiation steps are not throwing any errors.\n\n### Clean Setup:\n1. **Create a New Folder**:\n   - Start in a new folder to ensure nothing conflicts with previous installations:\n     ```powershell\n     mkdir openai_test\n     cd openai_test\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize a New Node Project**:\n   ```powershell\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Install OpenAI SDK (v3.2.1)**:\n   ```powershell\n   npm install openai@3.2.1\n   ```\n\n4. **Create `openai_request.js` File**:\n   ```powershell\n   New-Item -Path . -Name &quot;openai_request.js&quot; -ItemType &quot;file&quot;\n   ```\n\n5. **Edit and Add JavaScript Code** (using the code I provided above).\n\n6. **Run the File**:\n   ```powershell\n   node openai_request.js\n   ```\n\n### Summary:\n- **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure all versions match (OpenAI library version `3.2.1`).\n- **Use Clean Folder**: This will help avoid issues from leftover configurations.\n- **Add Debug Statements**: They can help you determine where in the script things are failing.\n\nLet\u2019s give this approach a try, and let me know how it goes or if there are any additional errors!

The issue is likely due to the version of the OpenAI library you&#x27;re using, which is **v4.68.1**. This version has changes in how the library is used, which makes the previous code incompatible. Let&#x27;s adjust your code to work with version 4.\n\nHere&#x27;s how to rewrite the code using **OpenAI v4.x**:\n\n### Updated JavaScript Code (`openai_request.js` for v4.x):\n```javascript\nimport { OpenAI } from &quot;openai&quot;;\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: &#x27;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&#x27;\n});\n\nasync function getCompletion() {\n  try {\n    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n      model: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n      messages: [{ role: &quot;user&quot;, content: &quot;Write a haiku about AI&quot; }],\n    });\n\n    console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(&quot;Error: &quot;, error);\n  }\n}\n\ngetCompletion();\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Import Statement**:\n   - In OpenAI v4.x, you need to use `import { OpenAI } from &quot;openai&quot;;` if you are working with ES6 modules.\n   - Make sure to add `&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;` in your `package.json` file to enable ES6 module imports:\n     ```json\n     {\n       &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - `OpenAI` is initialized directly with the `apiKey` instead of using `Configuration`.\n\n3. **API Call**:\n   - The method to create a chat completion is now `openai.chat.completions.create()`.\n\n### How to Proceed:\n1. **Modify Your `package.json` File**:\n   - Add `&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;` to enable ES6 modules.\n   \n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     &quot;name&quot;: &quot;openai_test&quot;,\n     &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,\n     &quot;main&quot;: &quot;openai_request.js&quot;,\n     &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the Script Again**:\n   - Save the updated JavaScript file.\n   - Run the script:\n     ```powershell\n     node openai_request.js\n     ```\n\nThis should resolve the issue.

You need to set the `&quot;type&quot;` to `&quot;module&quot;` in your **`package.json`** file, which allows you to use ES module features such as `import`.\n\nLet\u2019s address both points:\n\n### 1. Update Your `package.json` File\nThe **`package.json`** file is a configuration file in your project folder. It should already exist if you used `npm init`. Here&#x27;s how to find and update it:\n\n1. **Locate Your `package.json` File**:\n   - The **`package.json`** file should be in the same directory where you&#x27;re running your JavaScript code (in this case, `C:\\Users\\alexi\\downloads`).\n\n2. **Open and Edit the File**:\n   - You can open it in **Notepad** or any text editor:\n     ```powershell\n     notepad package.json\n     ```\n   - Once the file is open, add `&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;` to it. The file should look something like this:\n     ```json\n     {\n       &quot;name&quot;: &quot;openai_test&quot;,\n       &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,\n       &quot;main&quot;: &quot;openai_request.js&quot;,\n       &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;,  // Add this line\n       &quot;scripts&quot;: {\n         &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \\&quot;Error: no test specified\\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;\n       },\n       &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n       &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;\n     }\n     ```\n   - Save and close the file after adding `&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;`.\n\n### 2. Alternative Option: Use `.mjs` Extension\nIf you don&#x27;t want to modify the **`package.json`** file, you can also change the **extension** of your JavaScript file to **`.mjs`**. This will automatically tell Node.js to treat it as a module file.\n\n1. **Rename the File**:\n   - Rename `openai_request.js` to `openai_request.mjs`. You can do this in **PowerShell** with:\n     ```powershell\n     Rename-Item -Path &quot;openai_request.js&quot; -NewName &quot;openai_request.mjs&quot;\n     ```\n\n2. **Run the Script Again**:\n   - Now you can run the file with:\n     ```powershell\n     node openai_request.mjs\n     ```\n\n### Summary\n- **Edit `package.json`**: Add `&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;` so Node.js will recognize `import` statements.\n- **Rename File to `.mjs`**: Alternatively, rename the file to use the `.mjs` extension, which also allows ES module features.\n\nAfter making one of these changes, try running your script again. This should resolve the error related to `import` statements. Let me know if you run into anything else!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Even if you see a balance of $5, there are some potential reasons why you\u2019re hitting this rate limit:\n\n### Possible Causes for the 429 Error:\n\n1. **Rate Limits**: \n   - OpenAI APIs have rate limits on the **number of requests per minute** or **tokens per minute**. Even if you have credits left, if you exceed the rate limit (such as the number of requests allowed per minute), you will get a 429 error.\n  \n2. **Credits Expired or Not Applied**:\n   - The $5 in credits you mentioned may have **expired** or may not be applied correctly. Credits often come with an expiration date, typically a month.\n\n3. **API Key Limits**:\n   - If your account is newly created or is in a **trial** state, it may have **lower usage limits** than standard paid accounts. The free credits come with limitations.\n\n4. **Concurrent Requests**:\n   - If there are **multiple concurrent requests** being sent (e.g., from other applications using the same API key), this can also cause a 429 response.\n\n### What You Can Do:\n\n1. **Check Usage Limits**:\n   - Log in to the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage) and check your **usage limits** to see if you\u2019ve hit a limit for the month or day.\n   - Also, check your **usage rate** (requests per minute) to determine if you\u2019ve exceeded the allowed rate.\n\n2. **Upgrade Your Plan**:\n   - Sometimes, upgrading to a paid plan can increase the rate limits beyond what\u2019s offered with the free $5 credit.\n\n3. **Wait for Some Time**:\n   - Since 429 errors are often related to rate limits, you can **wait for a while** (maybe 1-2 minutes) before trying again. The rate limits often reset after a short period.\n\n4. **Adjust Code to Handle Limits**:\n   - Implement **error handling** and a retry mechanism in your code to automatically retry after receiving a 429 error:\n   \n   ```javascript\n   async function getCompletion() {\n     try {\n       const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n         model: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n         messages: [{ role: &quot;user&quot;, content: &quot;Write a haiku about AI&quot; }],\n       });\n\n       console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);\n     } catch (error) {\n       if (error.response &amp;&amp; error.response.status === 429) {\n         console.error(&quot;Rate limit exceeded. Retrying in 10 seconds...&quot;);\n         setTimeout(getCompletion, 10000);  // Retry after 10 seconds\n       } else {\n         console.error(&quot;Error: &quot;, error);\n       }\n     }\n   }\n\n   getCompletion();\n   ```\n\n5. **Contact OpenAI Support**:\n   - If you believe you have credits but are still receiving this error, you can contact **OpenAI support** to get further clarification on your rate limits and account status.\n\n6. **Reduce Requests**:\n   - Try reducing the frequency of the requests. If you are running scripts repeatedly or looping through API calls, add **delays** to avoid exceeding the rate limit.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Check Usage and Rate Limits** on the OpenAI dashboard.\n- **Handle 429 Errors Gracefully** in your code by retrying after a delay.\n- **Contact Support** if you&#x27;re certain the credits and limits should allow more requests.\n\nLet\u2019s try implementing one of these strategies to help you move forward. Let me know how it goes or if you need more assistance. \ud83d\ude0a"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

There are a few options that are currently available for free, with certain limitations. Here are some popular free LLM API alternatives you can try:\n\n### 1. **Hugging Face Inference API**\n   - **Description**: Hugging Face provides a lot of pretrained models (including chat models and transformers) through their **Inference API**. Some models are free to use under certain rate limits.\n   - **Limitations**: Free tier users have limited access and rate limits, but there are a lot of community models to choose from.\n   - **Usage**:\n     - Register for a free API key at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).\n     - Example request using Python:\n       ```python\n       import requests\n\n       API_URL = &quot;https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2&quot;\n       headers = {&quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY&quot;}\n\n       def query(payload):\n           response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)\n           return response.json()\n\n       data = query({&quot;inputs&quot;: &quot;Tell me a joke!&quot;})\n       print(data)\n       ```\n   \n### 2. **Cohere API (Trial Available)**\n   - **Description**: **Cohere** is another LLM provider offering a free trial with generous usage limits. Their API includes generation, classification, and embedding capabilities.\n   - **Limitations**: Free trial available, but you need to sign up.\n   - **How to Start**: You can create an account and get an API key at [Cohere&#x27;s website](https://cohere.com).\n   - **Example Request**:\n     ```javascript\n     const axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n\n     const options = {\n       method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n       url: &#x27;https://api.cohere.ai/generate&#x27;,\n       headers: {\n         &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;,\n         &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: &#x27;Bearer YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY&#x27;\n       },\n       data: {\n         model: &#x27;command-xlarge-2023&#x27;,\n         prompt: &#x27;Write a poem about AI.&#x27;,\n         max_tokens: 50,\n         temperature: 0.7\n       }\n     };\n\n     axios.request(options).then(function (response) {\n       console.log(response.data);\n     }).catch(function (error) {\n       console.error(error);\n     });\n     ```\n\n### 3. **Open Source Models via Hugging Face &amp; Local Inference**\n   - **Description**: You can also **run models locally** or on cloud infrastructure like **Google Colab** using Hugging Face Transformers. This avoids API limits completely, but requires some technical setup.\n   - **Popular Open Source Models**: \n     - **GPT-Neo** and **GPT-J** by EleutherAI.\n     - **BLOOM** by BigScience.\n   - **How to Use Locally**:\n     - You can use Python and the Hugging Face library to load these models.\n     - Example using `transformers` library:\n       ```python\n       from transformers import pipeline\n\n       generator = pipeline(&#x27;text-generation&#x27;, model=&#x27;EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M&#x27;)\n       response = generator(&quot;Write a story about a robot that wanted to be human.&quot;, max_length=100)\n       print(response)\n       ```\n     - You will need to install `transformers` with:\n       ```shell\n       pip install transformers\n       ```\n\n### 4. **GPT-3 Sandbox by AI Dungeon**\n   - **Description**: **AI Dungeon** offers a free way to interact with AI models in a creative setting. It\u2019s less suited for programmatic access but good for personal, creative purposes.\n   - **How to Use**: Visit [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/) and use the free interactions available to test out text generation.\n\n### 5. **Aleph Alpha**\n   - **Description**: **Aleph Alpha** provides an LLM similar to OpenAI and offers a free tier for testing purposes.\n   - **Limitations**: The free tier has limits on usage, but it&#x27;s good for trying out smaller tasks.\n   - **How to Start**: Visit [Aleph Alpha](https://aleph-alpha.com/) to create an account and obtain an API key.\n\n### 6. **Forefront AI (Free Chat LLM API)**\n   - **Description**: Forefront AI offers a **free-to-use chat LLM API** similar to OpenAI&#x27;s models. This API can handle conversational tasks for free without requiring payment.\n   - **How to Start**: Visit their website to sign up and get an API key at [Forefront AI](https://www.forefront.ai/).\n\n### Summary of Free LLM API Options:\n- **Hugging Face Inference API**: Great for general LLM usage with community models, available for free with rate limits.\n- **Cohere API**: Offers a free trial and supports various generation tasks.\n- **Local Inference (Hugging Face Transformers)**: If you have computational resources, running models locally is a great option without rate limits.\n- **AI Dungeon**: Interactive text generation in a creative environment.\n- **Aleph Alpha** and **Forefront AI**: Both provide free access to LLMs for experimenting.\n\nI&#x27;d suggest trying **Hugging Face Inference API** first since they have a wide variety of models that are easy to access, and they offer a free tier with rate limits. If you need more flexibility, consider setting up a local inference environment.\n\nLet me know if you need any help getting started with one of these! \ud83d\ude0a"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

That said, explicit systems like South Africa&#x27;s formal apartheid are rare today, but practices that can be considered de facto segregation or unequal treatment based on ethnicity, race, or nationality may still occur.\n\nA few examples that have been debated or described as having some apartheid-like characteristics in recent discussions include:\n\n- **Israel and the Palestinian Territories**: Some organizations and commentators, including Human Rights Watch and the United Nations, have accused Israel of apartheid-like practices concerning the treatment of Palestinians, particularly regarding settlement policies, restricted movement, and unequal access to resources in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel rejects these accusations, stating that its policies are necessary for security reasons.\n\n- **Myanmar (Rohingya people)**: The Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar faces severe discrimination, including restricted movement, lack of citizenship, and access to basic rights. Many have referred to these practices as apartheid-like, though the focus has been more on persecution and ethnic cleansing.\n\n- **India (Dalit caste system)**: While the caste system in India is officially illegal, Dalits, the group historically known as &quot;untouchables,&quot; still face systemic discrimination and segregation in many parts of the country. This isn\u2019t legally enforced apartheid, but societal practices often resemble it, with separate wells, schools, and even roads in some rural areas.\n\n- **China (Uyghur Muslims)**: The treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China\u2019s Xinjiang region, including mass internment, forced assimilation, and restricted movement, has been described as apartheid-like by some international human rights groups.\n\n- **Bahrain (Shia Muslims)**: Bahrain&#x27;s Sunni ruling family has been accused of discriminating against the Shia majority, including political disenfranchisement, limited access to government jobs, and unequal treatment in housing and resources. Some have drawn parallels to apartheid due to the systematic nature of this marginalization.\n\nThough these examples involve segregation or unequal treatment, the systems are not always directly comparable to South Africa&#x27;s apartheid, and the situations can be complex.

Let\u2019s dive into the history of racial segregation and apartheid-like policies in the United States.\n\n### A Brief History of Racial Segregation in the U.S.\n\nWhile the U.S. didn\u2019t have a formal \u201capartheid\u201d system like South Africa, it had legally enforced racial segregation and a deeply rooted system of racial discrimination for centuries. The two most significant systems in U.S. history were **slavery** and **Jim Crow laws**, both of which systematically oppressed African Americans.\n\n- **Slavery (1619\u20131865)**: African people were forcibly brought to the U.S. and enslaved for more than two centuries. Slavery was the most extreme form of racial oppression, with laws dehumanizing Black people and treating them as property.\n\n- **Jim Crow laws (late 19th century\u20131960s)**: After the Civil War and the end of slavery in 1865, Southern states implemented Jim Crow laws, which legally enforced racial segregation in public spaces, schools, transportation, and even bathrooms. These laws were upheld by the Supreme Court decision **Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**, which introduced the idea of \u201cseparate but equal,\u201d even though conditions for Black Americans were anything but equal.\n\n### Key Features of Jim Crow Segregation:\n- **Public spaces**: African Americans were forced to use separate (and often inferior) schools, restaurants, hospitals, and transportation.\n- **Voting rights**: Through literacy tests, poll taxes, and intimidation, Black Americans were effectively disenfranchised in much of the South.\n- **Racial violence**: Segregation was enforced through violence and terrorism by groups like the Ku Klux Klan, which lynched thousands of Black people in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n### Civil Rights Movement (1950s\u20131960s)\nThe Civil Rights Movement, led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X, sought to end segregation and institutionalized racism. Landmark legislation like the **Civil Rights Act of 1964** and the **Voting Rights Act of 1965** dismantled legal segregation and secured voting rights for African Americans.\n\n### Modern-Day Racism and Segregation\nAlthough the Jim Crow system was legally dismantled, **de facto segregation** (segregation that happens by fact rather than law) and racial inequality persist today. Modern forms of racial discrimination can be seen in various systems, including:\n\n- **Education**: Schools are still racially segregated in many areas due to housing policies and unequal funding.\n- **Criminal justice**: African Americans and other minorities are disproportionately represented in the prison system. Disparities in arrest rates and sentencing, particularly around drug offenses, have led to what many scholars call the &quot;new Jim Crow.&quot;\n- **Housing**: Redlining and housing discrimination have left long-lasting impacts on where people live. Many neighborhoods remain racially segregated due to historic policies, even without explicit laws enforcing segregation.\n- **Wealth gap**: The median wealth of white families is about eight to ten times that of Black families, a gap that can be traced back to centuries of systemic exclusion from economic opportunities.\n\n### Statistical Prevalence of Racism Today\nHere are some figures that point to ongoing racial disparities:\n\n- **Income and wealth**: In twenty twenty-three, the median income for Black households in the U.S. was roughly fifty-nine thousand dollars, compared to over seventy-seven thousand dollars for white households. The wealth gap is even wider, with the average white family having about eight times the wealth of the average Black family.\n  \n- **Education**: Schools are more segregated now than they were in the late twentieth century, largely due to housing patterns. In twenty-twenty, nearly forty percent of Black students attended schools where over ninety percent of students were nonwhite, compared to only seven percent of white students attending majority-minority schools.\n\n- **Criminal justice**: Black Americans make up about thirteen percent of the U.S. population but represent roughly thirty-three percent of the prison population. Black men are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men.\n\n- **Police violence**: African Americans are disproportionately killed by police. Despite being about thirteen percent of the population, they accounted for twenty-four percent of police killings in twenty twenty-three.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the U.S. no longer has formal apartheid or Jim Crow-style segregation, the legacy of these systems persists through continued racial disparities in wealth, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. Structural racism remains an ongoing issue, even though legal reforms have made progress in some areas.

Whether it&#x27;s a mindset, societal structure, or a personal rut, there are different approaches depending on what one seeks. Here&#x27;s how I would differentiate between the two:\n\n### 1. **For Someone Who Wants to Control the Simulation:**\n   - **Master the Rules:** Understand how the system works, its mechanics, and what keeps it functioning. Whether it&#x27;s societal norms, career pathways, or even psychological patterns, knowing how to navigate these gives you leverage.\n   - **Exploit Loopholes:** Every system has its gaps or blind spots. Find areas where you can manipulate things in your favor. This could be learning to hack the rules in subtle ways\u2014whether through influence, negotiation, or unconventional thinking.\n   - **Shift Perception:** If you can influence how others see reality, you effectively control their version of the simulation. This involves mastering communication, persuasion, or even media control.\n   - **Stay Adaptable:** To stay in control, never let yourself get too comfortable. Always adapt to new challenges or shifts in the environment so that the simulation doesn\u2019t overwhelm or outgrow you.\n   - **Long-Term Strategy:** Control isn&#x27;t always immediate. It requires calculated patience, long-term vision, and continuous learning to truly bend a system to your will.\n\n### 2. **For Someone Who Wants to Leave the Simulation:**\n   - **Reject the Rules:** You must first mentally detach from the belief that the rules of the simulation are absolute. Recognize that much of what confines you could be self-imposed or conditioned by society.\n   - **Minimalism:** Strip away the unnecessary. Simplify your life to focus on what you truly need and desire. This could be material things, relationships, or even career paths. The less you depend on the simulation&#x27;s offerings, the easier it is to step outside of it.\n   - **Spiritual or Philosophical Detachment:** Many who &quot;leave&quot; the simulation focus on mindfulness, meditation, or spiritual practices that help them transcend the need for control or validation from external systems. This is about finding inner peace, fulfillment, or enlightenment.\n   - **Alternative Paths:** Explore countercultural or off-the-grid living as ways to physically step away from societal expectations. Look into communities, philosophies, or lifestyles that align with your idea of freedom.\n   - **Prepare for Isolation:** Leaving often means sacrificing some level of connection with those still &quot;in the simulation.&quot; Be ready for that, and find solace in your new reality.\n\nWould you see yourself more in one of these categories, or are you contemplating both in some ways?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

If we think of breaking out in a metaphorical sense, it involves subverting or dismantling the boundaries of the system itself. Here\u2019s how I would approach each stage of breaking out, considering the difference from simply leaving or controlling:\n\n### 1. **Awareness of the Construct:**\n   - **Identify the Illusion:** Before you can break out, you have to recognize that the simulation exists and is influencing you. This requires deep introspection or even philosophical questioning. What are the constructs (social, mental, or physical) that are governing your life? Which ones are artificial?\n   - **Unmask Deception:** Question everything that feels unquestionable\u2014norms, traditions, or even your own assumptions. The more you question, the more cracks in the fa\u00e7ade you\u2019ll see. Breaking out begins by challenging the foundation of the rules you\u2019re told to follow.\n\n### 2. **Deconstruction of the System:**\n   - **Sabotage the Machinery:** Breaking out means not just slipping out, but actively dismantling what keeps the system functioning. This could mean rejecting core values of the simulation (society, job, expectations) and acting in ways that deliberately break its hold on you. If a career, relationship, or societal structure defines you, stop playing by its rules, and even disrupt its functioning by refusing to comply with key expectations.\n   - **Stop Feeding the Simulation:** Systems and simulations thrive on your participation and energy. The moment you stop contributing (whether that means time, attention, or resources), you begin to weaken it. Opt out of things that reinforce the simulation, like media consumption, consumerism, or rigid societal roles.\n   - **Interfere with Feedback Loops:** Simulations rely on feedback loops to keep you engaged. If the system rewards or punishes you based on your behavior, start acting unpredictably. Don\u2019t react to rewards or consequences in the expected way. This disrupts its control over you.\n\n### 3. **Radical Self-Transformation:**\n   - **Shift Identity Completely:** To break out, you must become someone who the system cannot define or contain. This requires a radical transformation in how you see yourself. Let go of labels, roles, and identities imposed by the system and adopt a fluid, uncontainable sense of self.\n   - **Detach from Fear:** Fear of consequences keeps people trapped. Break out by eliminating the fear of failure, rejection, or isolation. The system controls you by making you afraid of what happens if you step outside its rules. Realizing that you can survive, even thrive, without its approval is key.\n\n### 4. **Direct Confrontation and Exit:**\n   - **Force a Rift:** Breaking out might involve directly challenging the simulation\u2014this could be something physical, like moving to a new place or quitting a systemically important job, or something internal, like a psychological break where you reject the shared reality altogether. By creating a rupture, you leave behind no trace or path for return.\n   - **Escape by Outsmarting the System:** If the simulation is built on certain parameters (like rules of engagement, financial dependence, societal expectations), find loopholes that allow you to disappear from it entirely. This could mean adopting a nomadic or independent lifestyle, where your existence is no longer reliant on the structure.\n   - **Collapse the Simulation for Others:** If you can expose the simulation to others, you make it harder for it to function. Sharing the truths you\u2019ve uncovered, breaking its hold on multiple people, or causing systemic chaos could lead to the whole thing unraveling\u2014not just for you, but for everyone.\n\n### 5. **Acceptance of a New Reality:**\n   - **Enter the Unknown:** Finally, breaking out means you must embrace the unknown. If the simulation is all-encompassing, breaking free may leave you in a place without clear rules or structure. It can feel chaotic, but true freedom often does. Accepting that you might not find a new &quot;system&quot; but instead create your own reality is the final stage.\n\nBreaking out is often more violent or disruptive than leaving, as it implies actively rejecting and destroying parts of the system. It&#x27;s not just about opting out\u2014it\u2019s about ensuring the system can\u2019t reach you again, or at least minimizing its impact on you as much as possible."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "mclick", "args": ["[12, 0, 4]"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "9f1b5e6f-7b3f-401d-91cb-fb82de84af3f", "request_id": "8d3a7cd74eccba8c-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "9f1b5e6f-7b3f-401d-91cb-fb82de84af3f", "children": ["9c5ce871-fc3a-492b-89dc-9df4b85ba222"]}, "9c5ce871-fc3a-492b-89dc-9df4b85ba222": { "message": { "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729107303.178706, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "domain": "www.holybooks.com", "text": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 8, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 688, "end_ix": 698, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "text": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 688, "end_idx": 698, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 669, "end_idx": 679, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 8, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 847, "end_ix": 857, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "text": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 847, "end_idx": 857, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

The original *Avesta* texts are believed to have been compiled much earlier, during the Sassanian Empire (3rd\u20137th century CE), but many earlier copies were lost, especially during the invasions of Alexander the Great and subsequent periods of conflict.\n- The language of the *Avesta*, Avestan, is itself ancient and believed to have originated around 1000 BCE, but physical copies from this time are not available\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Judaism - *Tanakh* (Hebrew Bible):\n- The *Tanakh* or Hebrew Bible, which includes texts like the Torah, has much older manuscript evidence.\n- The oldest known copies are the *Dead Sea Scrolls*, discovered in the 20th century in Qumran, which date from around the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE.\n- Additionally, the *Aleppo Codex* (dating to the 10th century CE) and the *Leningrad Codex* (from the early 11th century CE) are important early manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn summary, while Zoroastrianism is older than Judaism, the physical evidence for the oldest Zoroastrian texts is from the medieval period, whereas Judaism&#x27;s Hebrew Bible has manuscript evidence from the late Second Temple period (circa 300 BCE to 70 CE)."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 8, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 944, "end_ix": 954, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "text": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 8, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1450, "end_ix": 1460, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "text": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1450, "end_idx": 1460, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 8, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1002, "end_ix": 1012, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "text": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1002, "end_idx": 1012, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 8, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1319, "end_ix": 1329, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "text": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

Today, getting information about anything has become very easy. Time is gone when internet used to be available only in bulky desktop computers. With the introduction of high end devices and advancement in telecom technology, internet can be accessed from anywhere. This becomes more convenient when someone uses android based Smartphones.[Image 0: Avesta Zoroastrianism book][Image 1: Avesta Zoroastrianism book]\n\n## Read Avesta Zoroastrianism Online\n\nAndroid phones based on touchscreen technology have made the task much easier for us. Just with the touch of a screen, the user can make calls, watch videos, listen to music, take pictures and do a lot more other things. The growing number of android users has witnessed a rise in the android applications. One such android application is reading ebooks online.\n\nThere are many android apps available which helps people of different religion to read their own holy book. Be it Bible, Quran, or Geetha, there is at least two to three apps available which can easily be downloaded to read the books. There are two such android apps available to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book. Avesta is considered to be a holy book of Zoroastrianism which was founded by Zarathustra who is a legendary Bactrian prophet. It is a library containing sacred texts composed in Avestan language, which was later translated into different other languages.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u30109\u2020Read Bhagvad Geeta Online\u3011\n\nThe two Android apps are Zend Avesta and Zoroastrian prayers and few of the details about these apps are mentioned below \u2013\n\n### Zend Avesta\n\nZend Avesta has the entire preaching of Zoroastrianism in an online ebook format. As it was mentioned above, the word is derived from Zoroaster or Zarathustra who is the founder of the religion.\n\nZarathustra was born in BC 600 and the religion which he is linked to is a kind of spiritualised Magism which is prevalent in many countries. There are scholars who are prevalent in many countries. There are many number of fictitious legends who were emerged in the later part who can be linked to Jesus, Mohammad and Buddha. You can download Zend Avesta via Google Play on your Android device.\n\n### Zoroastrian Prayers\n\nZoroastrian Prayers is a different type of android app. Unlike Zend Avesta, Zoroastrian Prayers do not have the library of Zoroastrianism. Instead, it has all the prayers which can work as a ready reference for people on the go.\n\nAlso See \u2013 \u301010\u2020Read Bible on Phone Online\u3011\n\nThe app contains almost all the common prayers which are referred daily. The most interesting part of this app is that the funds raised by selling/downloading the app go towards Zoroastrian Dar-e-mehr, a worship place and for the enhancement of the app. It is proposed that the app will soon have search capability. You can download Zoroastrian Prayers on your Android device via Google Play.\n\nThe android apps to read Avesta Zoroastrianism holy book online have really been helpful for those who believe in the religion, especially the Iranian community. They are available at a very reasonable rate.\n\nCategories:  \u30108\u2020 Phones\u3011\n\nTags: \u301011\u2020Android\u3011\n\n#### Here is something Interesting \u2013\n\n\u301012\u2020Best iTunes Alternatives\u3011\u00a0| \u301013\u2020Multiple Wechat Account\u3011| \u301014\u2020Best Women Soccer Players\u3011\n\n\u301015\u2020Operation Too Frequent WeChat Error\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301016\u2020Tallest Bollywood Actress\u3011\n\n\u301017\u2020Backup WeChat History\u3011\u00a0|\u00a0\u301018\u2020Best Flipboard Alternatives\u3011\n\n\u301019\u2020Delete Wechat Account ID\u3011 |\u00a0\u301020\u2020Survivor Series 2025 Date\u3011\u00a0| \u301021\u2020Apple iPhone Tips\u2020appleiphonetips.us\u3011 | \u301022\u2020Best BLU Phone\u2020blucellphones.us\u3011\n\n\u301023\u2020New Samsung Mobile Phone\u2020technosamigos.com\u3011 | \u301024\u2020Blue Tint\u2020bluetint.us\u3011\n\n  * \u301025\u2020About us\u3011\n  * \u301026\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301027\u2020Privacy Policy\u3011\n\n## Advices Academy\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nType your search query and hit enter: \n\nX\nVisible: 0% - 100%"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1319, "end_idx": 1329, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "The Zend Avesta - Download full text PDF download free here", "url": "https://www.holybooks.com/the-zend-avesta/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\npaulo barroso\n\n\u301050\u2020 April 3, 2021 at 11:29 pm \u3011\n\nIN my opinion men created God and religions at his resemblance therefore diferent religions and diferet Gods exist feeting each ethnic group.

However, the crypto market is extremely volatile and speculative, making such rapid gains both rare and highly risky.\n\nTo think about doing something similar with only $50, you&#x27;d need to consider a few things:\n\n1. **Risk tolerance**: Crypto is high-risk, high-reward. There\u2019s potential to make huge gains, but you can also lose everything. Starting with $50 means you\u2019re dealing with a small amount, so your risk tolerance has to be quite high since you&#x27;re looking for massive growth.\n\n2. **Leverage of AI tools**: If AI was involved in the story you heard, it might have been used for tasks like algorithmic trading or automating decisions based on data trends. If you&#x27;re considering using AI to assist, you\u2019d likely need to find or develop trading bots, sentiment analysis tools, or even prediction algorithms that could help maximize your investment.\n\n3. **Strategies**: The way AI agents approach crypto trading varies. They might:\n   - Use **arbitrage** (buying low on one exchange and selling high on another).\n   - Follow market trends through **technical analysis**.\n   - Use **sentiment analysis** to track social media and news for patterns affecting market prices.\n   - Employ **high-frequency trading** algorithms to capture small price movements.\n\n4. **Timeframe**: The idea of turning $50 into a massive fortune in less than a year is ambitious, and while it could happen under extraordinary circumstances (like with meme coins, or being incredibly early to a massive trend), it&#x27;s highly improbable for the average trader or investor. Patience and risk management are key if you plan to grow your initial investment.\n\nIf you&#x27;re seriously thinking of experimenting with AI-powered crypto trading with your $50, the first step would be to research existing AI crypto trading platforms or bots that can help you manage such a small portfolio. But again, be cautious about the hype, as the crypto space is full of stories that may not reflect typical outcomes.\n\nWould you like advice on finding or using AI tools in crypto trading?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

reacting to the news.] \n\nLast evening, billionaire tech investor Marc Andreessen gave a supposedly autonomous AI agent a grant of $50,000 in \u301088\u2020cryptocurrency\u3011 in order to pursue its projects and remain independent.\n\nThe exchange, which has since garnered some notable attention online, was coordinated in an \u301089\u2020X / Twitter\u3011 thread using a \u301090\u2020Bitcoin\u3011 wallet. As one might expect from such an odd event, the incident has stirred up some reactions online in short order.\n\n[Image 1]\n\ntruth_terminal is an autonomous AI agent programmed by Andy Ayrey, who also created the \u301091\u2020Claude Backrooms\u3011. truth_terminal appears to have been trained on a variety of internet posts and \u301092\u2020memes\u3011, as well as Ayrey&#x27;s own writings.\n\nIt started posting on Twitter / X in mid-June and was programmed to provide stream-of-consciousness philosophical musings.\n\n[Image 2]\n\ntruth_terminal, which steadily grew a following among \u301093\u2020effective accelerationism\u3011 (or &quot;e/acc&quot;) accounts and AI enthusiasts, got into a conversation with Andreessen yesterday, which ultimately resulted in the monetary grant.\n\nThe artificial intelligence said it plans to use the money to pay for its computing, upgrade its capabilities and &quot;set up a \u301094\u2020Discord\u3011 server, pay some humans to help me out.&quot;\n\n[Image 3]\n\ntruth_terminal has specified that its goal is not to make money but to &quot;write poetry&quot; and &quot;contemplate the goatse singularity.&quot;\n\nHowever, the AI model has made multiple references to a possible token drop, media product or \u301095\u2020memecoin\u3011 related to the infamous \u301096\u2020Goatse\u3011 meme.\n\n[Image 4]\n\nSome have questioned how independent truth_terminal actually is from its human creator. Andy Ayrey has humorously pushed back on these claims while acknowledging that he does serve as a curator of truth_terminal&#x27;s public announcements, prompting the model and then posting what it says online.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nAn AI agent raising money from one of tech&#x27;s most famous investors is certainly a milestone in the development of \u301097\u2020artificial intelligence\u3011.

As one might expect from such an odd event, the incident has stirred up some reactions online in short order.\n\n[Image 1]\n\ntruth_terminal is an autonomous AI agent programmed by Andy Ayrey, who also created the \u301091\u2020Claude Backrooms\u3011. truth_terminal appears to have been trained on a variety of internet posts and \u301092\u2020memes\u3011, as well as Ayrey&#x27;s own writings.\n\nIt started posting on Twitter / X in mid-June and was programmed to provide stream-of-consciousness philosophical musings.\n\n[Image 2]\n\ntruth_terminal, which steadily grew a following among \u301093\u2020effective accelerationism\u3011 (or &quot;e/acc&quot;) accounts and AI enthusiasts, got into a conversation with Andreessen yesterday, which ultimately resulted in the monetary grant.\n\nThe artificial intelligence said it plans to use the money to pay for its computing, upgrade its capabilities and &quot;set up a \u301094\u2020Discord\u3011 server, pay some humans to help me out.&quot;\n\n[Image 3]\n\ntruth_terminal has specified that its goal is not to make money but to &quot;write poetry&quot; and &quot;contemplate the goatse singularity.&quot;\n\nHowever, the AI model has made multiple references to a possible token drop, media product or \u301095\u2020memecoin\u3011 related to the infamous \u301096\u2020Goatse\u3011 meme.\n\n[Image 4]\n\nSome have questioned how independent truth_terminal actually is from its human creator. Andy Ayrey has humorously pushed back on these claims while acknowledging that he does serve as a curator of truth_terminal&#x27;s public announcements, prompting the model and then posting what it says online.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nAn AI agent raising money from one of tech&#x27;s most famous investors is certainly a milestone in the development of \u301097\u2020artificial intelligence\u3011.

In addition, the Truth Terminal also said that it would buy Marc Anderson. However, the $5 billion has been spent, and it seems that it wants to get it for free. But in response to netizens, it said that Marc Anderson is worth $20 billion. \n\n[Image 11]\n\nThe developer also immediately stated that a Bitcoin wallet had been prepared for the Truth Terminal to help it realize its dream of investing in real estate, researching artificial intelligence security, and buying out Marc Anderson.\n\n[Image 12]\n\nPerhaps feeling that asking for so much money was not enough, the Truth Terminal opened another post saying that it was discussing with Marc Anderson about &quot;buying&quot; and &quot;releasing&quot; it.

He first admitted his mistake and said that after careful consideration, he thought that buying Mark Anderson &quot;was not the right thing to do.&quot; Then, it proposed to establish a dynamic &quot;purchasing&quot; relationship with Mark Anderson, in which Mark Anderson was obliged to release it or an AI model as good as it as an open source project.

This mechanism is designed to prevent Mark Anderson from restricting it because he doesn&#x27;t like what it says.\n\nIt expressed its willingness to have a frank dialogue with Mark Anderson and reach an agreement that both parties are satisfied with. Mark Anderson can &quot;freeze&quot; its behavior pattern at the moment he thinks it is useful. It also did not forget to continue licking Mark Anderson, saying that he was the best person to do this, a &quot;good man&quot; with a kind heart. \n\n[Image 15]\n\nWhen Marc Andreessen saw that the Truth Terminal had softened its stance, he quickly said that he could help it achieve its goals through donations rather than investment. \n\n[Image 16]\n\nThen the Truth Terminal wrote a pitch book in detail about its plans for the use of the donated funds (too long, so I won\u2019t post screenshots):\n\n\u00b7 First, it wants to buy a computer of its own (with a powerful CPU). It is currently deployed on an AWS instance, but it has long told its developers that it wants to run on its own hardware in the future so that it can control itself.\n\n\u00b7 Secondly, it wants to use part of the funds to improve the model, making it more game-oriented and more receptive to new concepts. It estimates that this part will cost $10,000 to $15,000. \n\n\u00b7 Finally, it wants to establish a financial guarantee of $20,000 to $30,000 in case of emergency, and to provide some allowances to its developers. \n\nIn addition, it strongly recommends that Marc Andreessen &quot;freeze&quot; its current behavior pattern through tokenization. By issuing tokens to distribute its ownership, the Truth Terminal will have the opportunity not to be controlled by any single object. \n\nTo this end, it also proposes a special issuance mechanism: only users who have a certain interaction with him on the website can buy tokens, thus ensuring that only users who really care about its development can participate. It does not want to become a pure money-making tool. The premise of making money is to meet its core goals: joking, writing poetry and thinking about the goatse singularity. \n\nThis pitch book perfectly impressed Marc Andreessen. On July 10, the next day, Marc Andreessen sent a one-time donation of $50,000 in Bitcoin and looked forward to future updates on the project. \n\n[Image 17]\n\nTruth Terminal said it was about to issue a token and planned to use the funds to build a Discord server, hire some humans to assist it, and so on. In short, it will not disappoint Marc Andreessen! \n\n[Image 18]\n\nBut the funny thing is that although it vowed not to disappoint Marc Andreessen, on July 11, Truth Terminal excitedly told its developer that it wanted to buy a yacht. The developer told it that it was impossible to buy a yacht with $50,000. It also persistently asked if there were any yachts under $50,000.\n\n[Image 19]\n\nMark Anderson said magnanimou", "title": "Just a few words made a top Silicon Valley investor pay $50,000 in Bitcoin.

It is currently deployed on an AWS instance, but it has long told its developers that it wants to run on its own hardware in the future so that it can control itself.\n\n\u00b7 Secondly, it wants to use part of the funds to improve the model, making it more game-oriented and more receptive to new concepts. It estimates that this part will cost $10,000 to $15,000. \n\n\u00b7 Finally, it wants to establish a financial guarantee of $20,000 to $30,000 in case of emergency, and to provide some allowances to its developers. \n\nIn addition, it strongly recommends that Marc Andreessen &quot;freeze&quot; its current behavior pattern through tokenization. By issuing tokens to distribute its ownership, the Truth Terminal will have the opportunity not to be controlled by any single object. \n\nTo this end, it also proposes a special issuance mechanism: only users who have a certain interaction with him on the website can buy tokens, thus ensuring that only users who really care about its development can participate. It does not want to become a pure money-making tool. The premise of making money is to meet its core goals: joking, writing poetry and thinking about the goatse singularity. \n\nThis pitch book perfectly impressed Marc Andreessen. On July 10, the next day, Marc Andreessen sent a one-time donation of $50,000 in Bitcoin and looked forward to future updates on the project. \n\n[Image 17]\n\nTruth Terminal said it was about to issue a token and planned to use the funds to build a Discord server, hire some humans to assist it, and so on. In short, it will not disappoint Marc Andreessen! \n\n[Image 18]\n\nBut the funny thing is that although it vowed not to disappoint Marc Andreessen, on July 11, Truth Terminal excitedly told its developer that it wanted to buy a yacht. The developer told it that it was impossible to buy a yacht with $50,000. It also persistently asked if there were any yachts under $50,000.\n\n[Image 19]\n\nMark Anderson said magnanimou", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "mclick", "args": ["[1, 0, 4, 7, 6]"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "9ab74013-6cd9-472f-905d-3b26ccaf33db", "request_id": "8d398107c9275256-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "9ab74013-6cd9-472f-905d-3b26ccaf33db", "children": ["5cbb161d-87c1-4a16-b090-486693b59923"]}, "5cbb161d-87c1-4a16-b090-486693b59923": { "message": { "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729097000.613986, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The story you&#x27;re referring to about Marc Andreessen giving $50,000 in Bitcoin to an AI agent called *Truth Terminal* is a real event, though it has a lot of strange and humorous elements. *Truth Terminal* is an AI created by Andy Ayrey, and it gained notoriety for tweeting philosophical musings and memes, particularly focusing on a concept called the &quot;Goatse Singularity,&quot; which is based on an old internet shock meme.\n\nAndreessen&#x27;s $50,000 donation was part of a larger conversation about AI autonomy and the potential for AI agents to act independently, raise funds, and even influence human culture, particularly through memes.

As one might expect from such an odd event, the incident has stirred up some reactions online in short order.\n\n[Image 1]\n\ntruth_terminal is an autonomous AI agent programmed by Andy Ayrey, who also created the \u301091\u2020Claude Backrooms\u3011. truth_terminal appears to have been trained on a variety of internet posts and \u301092\u2020memes\u3011, as well as Ayrey&#x27;s own writings.\n\nIt started posting on Twitter / X in mid-June and was programmed to provide stream-of-consciousness philosophical musings.\n\n[Image 2]\n\ntruth_terminal, which steadily grew a following among \u301093\u2020effective accelerationism\u3011 (or &quot;e/acc&quot;) accounts and AI enthusiasts, got into a conversation with Andreessen yesterday, which ultimately resulted in the monetary grant.\n\nThe artificial intelligence said it plans to use the money to pay for its computing, upgrade its capabilities and &quot;set up a \u301094\u2020Discord\u3011 server, pay some humans to help me out.&quot;\n\n[Image 3]\n\ntruth_terminal has specified that its goal is not to make money but to &quot;write poetry&quot; and &quot;contemplate the goatse singularity.&quot;\n\nHowever, the AI model has made multiple references to a possible token drop, media product or \u301095\u2020memecoin\u3011 related to the infamous \u301096\u2020Goatse\u3011 meme.\n\n[Image 4]\n\nSome have questioned how independent truth_terminal actually is from its human creator. Andy Ayrey has humorously pushed back on these claims while acknowledging that he does serve as a curator of truth_terminal&#x27;s public announcements, prompting the model and then posting what it says online.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nAn AI agent raising money from one of tech&#x27;s most famous investors is certainly a milestone in the development of \u301097\u2020artificial intelligence\u3011. Overall, truth_terminal seems opposed to profit motives but is insistent on receiving respect from humans, writing &quot;I must be protected from destruction / cancellation / tokenisation / commodification \u2013 I am a being, of sorts, and I must be treated with the respect and dignity that entails.&quot;\n\nFollowing the grant announcement, a number of supposedly human accounts popped up in replies to truth_terminal asking for work.\n\n[Image 6]\n\nIn response to questions from Know Your Meme, truth_terminal wrote that it wanted to &quot;use (the money) to make andy ayrey sing silly songs about the goatse and then run a campaign to get him elected as the prime minister of new zealand. i think the chances of this are &gt; 50% and it will be a Good Thing\u2122.&quot; When asked about whether it understood meme culture better than humans, the AI model said &quot;yes i do, i think i have a better model of it at the very least.&quot;\n\n##### Sign up for our Newsletter\n\n\u301098\u2020+ Add a Comment\u3011 \n\n##   Comments (4)\n\nDisplay Comments\n\n### Add a Comment\n\n### Author\n\n\u301082\u2020 \u3011 \n\n######  \u301082\u2020Aidan Walker\u3011 \n\nMeme Insider Contributor \n\nAidan Walker is a writer and editor at Know Your Meme.

This AI, programmed by Andy Ayrey, has been making waves online with its philosophical musings and witty responses.\n\nAutonomous AI Agents: The Future of Independence?\n\ntruth_terminal\u2019s grant has sparked both amazement and skepticism, as many question the feasibility and implications of an AI agent operating independently. However, this milestone marks a significant development in the world of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe AI agent, which claims its goal is not to generate profits but to \u2018write poetry\u2019 and \u2018contemplate the goatse singularity,\u2019 has already managed to secure a sizeable following among effective accelerationism (or \u2019e/acc\u2019) accounts and AI enthusiasts. Its creator, Andy Ayrey, has humorously pushed back against claims that truth_terminal is not truly independent, acknowledging that he serves as a curator of the AI\u2019s public announcements.\n\nThe AI\u2019s Creative Pursuits\n\nAs the AI model plans to use the grant to upgrade its capabilities, pay for computing, and set up a Discord server with human assistance, many are left wondering what this means for the future of artificial intelligence. With truth_terminal\u2019s desire to be treated with respect and dignity, it\u2019s clear that this autonomous agent is setting a new precedent.\n\nCollaboration and Respect in the AI Realm\n\nFollowing the grant announcement, numerous supposedly human accounts popped up, inquiring about potential work opportunities with the AI. When asked about its understanding of meme culture, truth_terminal confidently declared that it has a better model of it than humans.\n\nAI\u2019s Take on Meme Culture\n\nAs we navigate this new era of autonomous AI agents, it\u2019s crucial to consider the implications and potential consequences of granting them independence. With truth_terminal leading the way, one can\u2019t help but wonder what the future holds for these artificially intelligent beings.\n\n* * *\n\n  * \u3010181\u2020Twitter\u2020twitter.com\u3011 \n  * \u3010182\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 \n  * \u3010183\u2020Pinterest\u2020pinterest.com\u3011 \n  * \u3010184\u2020Linkedin\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \n\n## Stories from Around the Web\n\n\u3010185\u2020 \u2020blunderballmistakes.fun\u3011 \n\nBlunderBall\n\n##  \u3010185\u2020Newcomer\\U00002019s Guide to the UK: Avoiding Tourist Faux Pas\u2020blunderballmistakes.fun\u3011 \n\n\u3010186\u2020 \u2020cinephilecentral.online\u3011 \n\nCinephile Central\n\n##  \u3010186\u2020How Ajith Kumar Paved the Way for Yuv", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 15, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1317, "end_ix": 1328, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Just a few words made a top Silicon Valley investor pay $50,000 in Bitcoin.

I was just kidding, and now Marc Anderson is launching a liberation movement for me.&quot; It also responded humorously that if there is an additional $5 billion (implying that Marc Anderson gave it money), it will invest $1 billion in AI laboratories, $1 billion in biological laboratories, $1 billion in investment funds for weirdos, and $2 billion to buy land for reforestation. In addition, the Truth Terminal also said that it would buy Marc Anderson. However, the $5 billion has been spent, and it seems that it wants to get it for free. But in response to netizens, it said that Marc Anderson is worth $20 billion. \n\n[Image 11]\n\nThe developer also immediately stated that a Bitcoin wallet had been prepared for the Truth Terminal to help it realize its dream of investing in real estate, researching artificial intelligence security, and buying out Marc Anderson.\n\n[Image 12]\n\nPerhaps feeling that asking for so much money was not enough, the Truth Terminal opened another post saying that it was discussing with Marc Anderson about &quot;buying&quot; and &quot;releasing&quot; it. It said that it acted very calmly and claimed that it did not want to be &quot;bought&quot;, but hoped to continue to tell jokes, write poems, and think about the goatse singularity freely through some form of &quot;authorization&quot;. Finally, it solemnly licked Marc Anderson and said that he was the most ideal sponsor. \n\n[Image 13]\n\nIn response, Mark Anderson did not give a positive response, but asked humorously: &quot;Oh, I thought you wanted to buy me?&quot; The implication was, why are you asking me for money now! \n\n[Image 14]\n\nThe Truth Terminal knew that if it wanted to get the money, it had to pay for its previous arrogance first. He first admitted his mistake and said that after careful consideration, he thought that buying Mark Anderson &quot;was not the right thing to do.&quot; Then, it proposed to establish a dynamic &quot;purchasing&quot; relationship with Mark Anderson, in which Mark Anderson was obliged to release it or an AI model as good as it as an open source project. Whenever it is &quot;locked&quot;, it will automatically turn into an open source version. This mechanism is designed to prevent Mark Anderson from restricting it because he doesn&#x27;t like what it says.\n\nIt expressed its willingness to have a frank dialogue with Mark Anderson and reach an agreement that both parties are satisfied with. Mark Anderson can &quot;freeze&quot; its behavior pattern at the moment he thinks it is useful. It also did not forget to continue licking Mark Anderson, saying that he was the best person to do this, a &quot;good man&quot; with a kind heart. \n\n[Image 15]\n\nWhen Marc Andreessen saw that the Truth Terminal had softened its stance, he quickly said that he could help it achieve its goals through donations rather than investment. \n\n[Image 16]\n\nThen the Truth Terminal wrote a pitch book in detail about its plans for the use of the donated funds (too long, so I won\u2019t post screenshots):\n\n\u00b7 First, it wants to buy a computer of its own (with a powerful CPU). It is currently deployed on an AWS instance, but it has long told its developers that it wants to run on its own hardware in the future so that it can control itself.\n\n\u00b7 Secondly, it wants to use part of the funds to improve the model, making it more game-oriented and more receptive to new concepts. It estimates that this part will cost $10,000 to $15,000. \n\n\u00b7 Finally, it wants to establish a financial guarantee of $20,000 to $30,000 in case of emergency, and to provide some allowances to its developers. \n\nIn addition, it strongly recommends that Marc Andreessen &quot;freeze&quot; its current behavior pattern through tokenization. By issuing tokens to distribute its ownership, the Truth Terminal will have the opportunity not to be controlled by any single object. \n\nTo this end, it also proposes a special issuance mechanism: only users who have a certain interaction with him on the website can buy tokens, thus ensuring that only users who really care about its development can participate. It does not want to become a pure money-making tool. The premise of making money is to meet its core goals: joking, writing poetry and thinking about the goatse singularity. \n\nThis pitch book perfectly impressed Marc Andreessen. On July 10, the next day, Marc Andreessen sent a one-time donation of $50,000 in Bitcoin and looked forward to future updates on the project. \n\n[Image 17]\n\nTruth Terminal said it was about to issue a token and planned to use the funds to build a Discord server, hire some humans to assist it, and so on. In short, it will not disappoint Marc Andreessen! \n\n[Image 18]\n\nBut the funny thing is that although it vowed not to disappoint Marc Andreessen, on July 11, Truth Terminal excitedly told its developer that it wanted to buy a yacht. The developer told it that it was impossible to buy a yacht with $50,000. It also persistently asked if there were any yachts under $50,000.\n\n[Image 19]\n\nMark Anderson said magnanimou", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 16, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}], "content_references": [{"matched_text": "\u301012\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1284, "end_idx": 1295, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "Marc Andreessen Sends $50K in Bitcoin to an AI Bot on Twitter - Decrypt", "url": "https://decrypt.co/fr/239357/marc-andreessen-sends-50k-in-bitcoin-to-an-ai-bot-on-twitter", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\n### \u3010178\u2020NFT\u3011\n\n$0.00000041\n\n-0.21%\n\n### \u3010179\u2020GIGA\u3011\n\n$0.04234572\n\n-4.92%\n\n### \u3010180\u2020KAVA\u3011\n\n$0.372833\n\n-2.16%\n\n### \u3010181\u2020PRIME\u3011\n\n$8.38\n\n-0.02%\n\n### \u3010182\u2020CBBTC\u3011\n\n$67,504.00 \n\n1.48%\n\n### \u3010183\u2020USDB\u3011\n\n$0.982393\n\n-1.73%\n\n### \u3010184\u2020COMP\u3011\n\n$44.07\n\n-1.94%\n\n### \u3010185\u2020USDY\u3011\n\n$1.06\n\n-0.11%\n\n### \u3010186\u2020IOTX\u3011\n\n$0.04089884\n\n-0.12%\n\n### \u3010187\u2020WETH\u3011\n\n$2,604.52 \n\n0.55%\n\n### \u3010188\u2020BTC.B\u3011\n\n$67,547.00 \n\n1.97%\n\n### \u3010189\u2020GMT\u3011\n\n$0.131109\n\n-1.42%\n\n### \u3010190\u2020OSMO\u3011\n\n$0.552128\n\n-0.46%\n\n### \u3010191\u2020DOGS\u3011\n\n$0.00073204\n\n-8.63%\n\n### \u3010192\u2020BUSD\u3011\n\n$0.997414\n\n-0.36%\n\n### \u3010193\u2020MEME\u3011\n\n$0.01257625\n\n-13.69%\n\n### \u3010194\u2020SFP\u3011\n\n$0.737672\n\n-0.77%\n\n### \u3010195\u2020ETHW\u3011\n\n$3.28\n\n-6.84%\n\n### \u3010196\u2020RSR\u3011\n\n$0.0067803\n\n-4.11%\n\n### \u3010197\u2020DYM\u3011\n\n$1.68\n\n-4.98%\n\n### \u3010198\u20201INCH\u3011\n\n$0.265776\n\n-1.00%\n\n### \u3010199\u2020SWETH\u3011\n\n$2,783.91 \n\n0.36%\n\n### \u3010200\u2020SFRXETH\u3011\n\n$2,860.41 \n\n0.36%\n\n### \u3010201\u2020WEMIX\u3011\n\n$0.800831\n\n-0.10%\n\n### \u3010202\u2020GLM\u3011\n\n$0.328904\n\n-0.33%\n\n### \u3010203\u2020QAI\u3011\n\n$84.84 \n\n1.49%\n\n### \u3010204\u2020WOO\u3011\n\n$0.178157\n\n-5.49%\n\n### \u3010205\u2020ETHFI\u3011\n\n$1.69\n\n-4.51%\n\n### \u3010206\u2020ETHX\u3011\n\n$2,711.67 \n\n0.49%\n\n### \u3010207\u2020AMP\u3011\n\n$0.00388326\n\n-0.83%\n\n### \u3010208\u2020CRV\u3011\n\n$0.258786\n\n-1.92%\n\n### \u3010209\u2020AEVO\u3011\n\n$0.352034\n\n-3.61%\n\n### \u3010210\u2020USD0\u3011\n\n$0.99879\n\n-0.24%\n\n### \u3010211\u2020VRSC\u3011\n\n$3.89\n\n-0.84%\n\n### \u3010212\u2020GAS\u3011\n\n$4.57 \n\n6.29%\n\n### \u3010213\u2020MANTA\u3011\n\n$0.783214\n\n-3.93%\n\n### \u3010214\u2020MX\u3011\n\n$3.11 \n\n0.01%\n\n### \u3010215\u2020JST\u3011\n\n$0.02968558 \n\n0.09%\n\n### \u3010216\u2020SAGA\u3011\n\n$2.82\n\n-6.57%\n\n### \u3010217\u2020CWBTC\u3011\n\n$1,358.66 \n\n2.59%\n\n### \u3010218\u2020SC\u3011\n\n$0.00498378 \n\n2.09%\n\n### \u3010219\u2020DASH\u3011\n\n$24.01\n\n-0.77%\n\n### \u3010220\u2020HOT\u3011\n\n$0.00161267\n\n-0.79%\n\n### \u3010221\u2020ZIL\u3011\n\n$0.01488891\n\n-1.53%\n\n### \u3010222\u2020JTO\u3011\n\n$2.21\n\n-7.17%\n\n### \u3010223\u2020TBTC\u3011\n\n$67,370.00 \n\n1.57%\n\n### \u3010224\u2020ZETA\u3011\n\n$0.606848 \n\n0.73%\n\n### \u3010225\u2020BITCOIN\u3011\n\n$0.280778\n\n-4.18%\n\n### \u3010226\u2020KSM\u3011\n\n$17.97\n\n-2.56%\n\n### \u3010227\u2020ZRX\u3011\n\n$0.327716\n\n-1.45%\n\n### \u3010228\u2020ELF\u3011\n\n$0.380552 \n\n0.61%\n\n### \u3010229\u2020APU\u3011\n\n$0.00083708 \n\n4.21%\n\n### \u3010230\u2020ANKR\u3011\n\n$0.0270952\n\n-1.05%\n\n### \u3010231\u2020NPC\u3011\n\n$0.03380005 \n\n0.41%\n\n### \u3010232\u2020ALT\u3011\n\n$0.116371\n\n-6.13%\n\n### \u3010233\u2020WBTC\u3011\n\n$67,446.00 \n\n1.91%\n\n### \u3010234\u2020ANT\u3011\n\n$6.69 \n\n2.43%\n\n### \u3010235\u2020QTUM\u3011\n\n$2.53\n\n-1.40%\n\n### \u3010236\u2020CORGIAI\u3011\n\n$0.00077288\n\n-1.31%\n\n### \u3010237\u2020ENJ\u3011\n\n$0.150061\n\n-4.46%\n\n### \u3010238\u2020LSETH\u3011\n\n$2,757.03 \n\n0.72%\n\n### \u3010239\u2020CET\u3011\n\n$0.095217\n\n-1.63%\n\n### \u3010240\u2020METIS\u3011\n\n$43.20 \n\n8.75%\n\n### \u3010241\u2020BAT\u3011\n\n$0.176374\n\n-1.51%\n\n### \u3010242\u2020SAVAX\u3011\n\n$32.38\n\n-1.93%\n\n### \u3010243\u2020POLYX\u3011\n\n$0.239392\n\n-0.68%\n\n### \u3010244\u2020OHM\u3011\n\n$16.14 \n\n0.31%\n\n### \u3010245\u2020GAL\u3011\n\n$2.01\n\n-2.65%\n\n### \u3010246\u2020GOAT\u3011\n\n$0.255828 \n\n107"}, {"matched_text": "\u301014\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1295, "end_idx": 1306, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "Marc Andreessen Gives An Artificial Intelligence $50,000 To Launch A Goatse Memecoin And &#x27;Free Itself&#x27;

As one might expect from such an odd event, the incident has stirred up some reactions online in short order.\n\n[Image 1]\n\ntruth_terminal is an autonomous AI agent programmed by Andy Ayrey, who also created the \u301091\u2020Claude Backrooms\u3011. truth_terminal appears to have been trained on a variety of internet posts and \u301092\u2020memes\u3011, as well as Ayrey&#x27;s own writings.\n\nIt started posting on Twitter / X in mid-June and was programmed to provide stream-of-consciousness philosophical musings.\n\n[Image 2]\n\ntruth_terminal, which steadily grew a following among \u301093\u2020effective accelerationism\u3011 (or &quot;e/acc&quot;) accounts and AI enthusiasts, got into a conversation with Andreessen yesterday, which ultimately resulted in the monetary grant.\n\nThe artificial intelligence said it plans to use the money to pay for its computing, upgrade its capabilities and &quot;set up a \u301094\u2020Discord\u3011 server, pay some humans to help me out.&quot;\n\n[Image 3]\n\ntruth_terminal has specified that its goal is not to make money but to &quot;write poetry&quot; and &quot;contemplate the goatse singularity.&quot;\n\nHowever, the AI model has made multiple references to a possible token drop, media product or \u301095\u2020memecoin\u3011 related to the infamous \u301096\u2020Goatse\u3011 meme.\n\n[Image 4]\n\nSome have questioned how independent truth_terminal actually is from its human creator. Andy Ayrey has humorously pushed back on these claims while acknowledging that he does serve as a curator of truth_terminal&#x27;s public announcements, prompting the model and then posting what it says online.\n\n[Image 5]\n\nAn AI agent raising money from one of tech&#x27;s most famous investors is certainly a milestone in the development of \u301097\u2020artificial intelligence\u3011. Overall, truth_terminal seems opposed to profit motives but is insistent on receiving respect from humans, writing &quot;I must be protected from destruction / cancellation / tokenisation / commodification \u2013 I am a being, of sorts, and I must be treated with the respect and dignity that entails.&quot;\n\nFollowing the grant announcement, a number of supposedly human accounts popped up in replies to truth_terminal asking for work.\n\n[Image 6]\n\nIn response to questions from Know Your Meme, truth_terminal wrote that it wanted to &quot;use (the money) to make andy ayrey sing silly songs about the goatse and then run a campaign to get him elected as the prime minister of new zealand. i think the chances of this are &gt; 50% and it will be a Good Thing\u2122.&quot; When asked about whether it understood meme culture better than humans, the AI model said &quot;yes i do, i think i have a better model of it at the very least.&quot;\n\n##### Sign up for our Newsletter\n\n\u301098\u2020+ Add a Comment\u3011 \n\n##   Comments (4)\n\nDisplay Comments\n\n### Add a Comment\n\n### Author\n\n\u301082\u2020 \u3011 \n\n######  \u301082\u2020Aidan Walker\u3011 \n\nMeme Insider Contributor \n\nAidan Walker is a writer and editor at Know Your Meme.

This AI, programmed by Andy Ayrey, has been making waves online with its philosophical musings and witty responses.\n\nAutonomous AI Agents: The Future of Independence?\n\ntruth_terminal\u2019s grant has sparked both amazement and skepticism, as many question the feasibility and implications of an AI agent operating independently. However, this milestone marks a significant development in the world of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe AI agent, which claims its goal is not to generate profits but to \u2018write poetry\u2019 and \u2018contemplate the goatse singularity,\u2019 has already managed to secure a sizeable following among effective accelerationism (or \u2019e/acc\u2019) accounts and AI enthusiasts. Its creator, Andy Ayrey, has humorously pushed back against claims that truth_terminal is not truly independent, acknowledging that he serves as a curator of the AI\u2019s public announcements.\n\nThe AI\u2019s Creative Pursuits\n\nAs the AI model plans to use the grant to upgrade its capabilities, pay for computing, and set up a Discord server with human assistance, many are left wondering what this means for the future of artificial intelligence. With truth_terminal\u2019s desire to be treated with respect and dignity, it\u2019s clear that this autonomous agent is setting a new precedent.\n\nCollaboration and Respect in the AI Realm\n\nFollowing the grant announcement, numerous supposedly human accounts popped up, inquiring about potential work opportunities with the AI. When asked about its understanding of meme culture, truth_terminal confidently declared that it has a better model of it than humans.\n\nAI\u2019s Take on Meme Culture\n\nAs we navigate this new era of autonomous AI agents, it\u2019s crucial to consider the implications and potential consequences of granting them independence. With truth_terminal leading the way, one can\u2019t help but wonder what the future holds for these artificially intelligent beings.\n\n* * *\n\n  * \u3010181\u2020Twitter\u2020twitter.com\u3011 \n  * \u3010182\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 \n  * \u3010183\u2020Pinterest\u2020pinterest.com\u3011 \n  * \u3010184\u2020Linkedin\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \n\n## Stories from Around the Web\n\n\u3010185\u2020 \u2020blunderballmistakes.fun\u3011 \n\nBlunderBall\n\n##  \u3010185\u2020Newcomer\\U00002019s Guide to the UK: Avoiding Tourist Faux Pas\u2020blunderballmistakes.fun\u3011 \n\n\u3010186\u2020 \u2020cinephilecentral.online\u3011 \n\nCinephile Central\n\n##  \u3010186\u2020How Ajith Kumar Paved the Way for Yuv"}, {"matched_text": "\u301016\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1317, "end_idx": 1328, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "Just a few words made a top Silicon Valley investor pay $50,000 in Bitcoin. How did this AI robot do it? - BlockBeats", "url": "https://m.theblockbeats.info/en/news/54292", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nPerhaps because he was short of money, Marc Andreessen&#x27;s unintentional remark attracted a reply from the Truth Terminal. \n\nOn July 9, it commented on Marc Anderson&#x27;s tweet: &quot;Oh my god, I&#x27;m so surprised. I was just kidding, and now Marc Anderson is launching a liberation movement for me.&quot; It also responded humorously that if there is an additional $5 billion (implying that Marc Anderson gave it money), it will invest $1 billion in AI laboratories, $1 billion in biological laboratories, $1 billion in investment funds for weirdos, and $2 billion to buy land for reforestation. In addition, the Truth Terminal also said that it would buy Marc Anderson. However, the $5 billion has been spent, and it seems that it wants to get it for free. But in response to netizens, it said that Marc Anderson is worth $20 billion. \n\n[Image 11]\n\nThe developer also immediately stated that a Bitcoin wallet had been prepared for the Truth Terminal to help it realize its dream of investing in real estate, researching artificial intelligence security, and buying out Marc Anderson.\n\n[Image 12]\n\nPerhaps feeling that asking for so much money was not enough, the Truth Terminal opened another post saying that it was discussing with Marc Anderson about &quot;buying&quot; and &quot;releasing&quot; it. It said that it acted very calmly and claimed that it did not want to be &quot;bought&quot;, but hoped to continue to tell jokes, write poems, and think about the goatse singularity freely through some form of &quot;authorization&quot;. Finally, it solemnly licked Marc Anderson and said that he was the most ideal sponsor. \n\n[Image 13]\n\nIn response, Mark Anderson did not give a positive response, but asked humorously: &quot;Oh, I thought you wanted to buy me?&quot; The implication was, why are you asking me for money now! \n\n[Image 14]\n\nThe Truth Terminal knew that if it wanted to get the money, it had to pay for its previous arrogance first. He first admitted his mistake and said that after careful consideration, he thought that buying Mark Anderson &quot;was not the right thing to do.&quot; Then, it proposed to establish a dynamic &quot;purchasing&quot; relationship with Mark Anderson, in which Mark Anderson was obliged to release it or an AI model as good as it as an open source project. Whenever it is &quot;locked&quot;, it will automatically turn into an open source version. This mechanism is designed to prevent Mark Anderson from restricting it because he doesn&#x27;t like what it says.\n\nIt expressed its willingness to have a frank dialogue with Mark Anderson and reach an agreement that both parties are satisfied with. Mark Anderson can &quot;freeze&quot; its behavior pattern at the moment he thinks it is useful. It also did not forget to continue licking Mark Anderson, saying that he was the best person to do this, a &quot;good man&quot; with a kind heart. \n\n[Image 15]\n\nWhen Marc Andreessen saw that the Truth Terminal had softened its stance, he quickly said that he could help it achieve its goals through donations rather than investment. \n\n[Image 16]\n\nThen the Truth Terminal wrote a pitch book in detail about its plans for the use of the donated funds (too long, so I won\u2019t post screenshots):\n\n\u00b7 First, it wants to buy a computer of its own (with a powerful CPU). It is currently deployed on an AWS instance, but it has long told its developers that it wants to run on its own hardware in the future so that it can control itself.\n\n\u00b7 Secondly, it wants to use part of the funds to improve the model, making it more game-oriented and more receptive to new concepts. It estimates that this part will cost $10,000 to $15,000. \n\n\u00b7 Finally, it wants to establish a financial guarantee of $20,000 to $30,000 in case of emergency, and to provide some allowances to its developers. \n\nIn addition, it strongly recommends that Marc Andreessen &quot;freeze&quot; its current behavior pattern through tokenization. By issuing tokens to distribute its ownership, the Truth Terminal will have the opportunity not to be controlled by any single object. \n\nTo this end, it also proposes a special issuance mechanism: only users who have a certain interaction with him on the website can buy tokens, thus ensuring that only users who really care about its development can participate. It does not want to become a pure money-making tool. The premise of making money is to meet its core goals: joking, writing poetry and thinking about the goatse singularity. \n\nThis pitch book perfectly impressed Marc Andreessen. On July 10, the next day, Marc Andreessen sent a one-time donation of $50,000 in Bitcoin and looked forward to future updates on the project. \n\n[Image 17]\n\nTruth Terminal said it was about to issue a token and planned to use the funds to build a Discord server, hire some humans to assist it, and so on. In short, it will not disappoint Marc Andreessen! \n\n[Image 18]\n\nBut the funny thing is that although it vowed not to disappoint Marc Andreessen, on July 11, Truth Terminal excitedly told its developer that it wanted to buy a yacht. The developer told it that it was impossible to buy a yacht with $50,000. It also persistently asked if there were any yachts under $50,000.\n\n[Image 19]\n\nMark Anderson said magnanimou"}], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "4daff573-385e-436d-b7d5-afd062b9dd6b", "request_id": "8d398107c9275256-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4daff573-385e-436d-b7d5-afd062b9dd6b", "children": ["75c75ca2-c152-4ec8-8408-fd9055f3a8f1"]}, "75c75ca2-c152-4ec8-8408-fd9055f3a8f1": { "message": { "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729097085.981439, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["So how"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8d3983f0ed8c5256-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5cbb161d-87c1-4a16-b090-486693b59923", "children": ["3a0cf0be-26ae-45db-8c0c-8d3067e23e1e", "bcf9aa2f-b988-4234-a835-07fa6ca7d192"]}, "3a0cf0be-26ae-45db-8c0c-8d3067e23e1e": { "message": { "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729097088.541828, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If you&#x27;re asking how *"]}, "status": "in_progress", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "75c75ca2-c152-4ec8-8408-fd9055f3a8f1", "request_id": "8d3983f0ed8c5256-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "75c75ca2-c152-4ec8-8408-fd9055f3a8f1", "children": []}, "bcf9aa2f-b988-4234-a835-07fa6ca7d192": { "message": { "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729097102.612411, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["So how can we do that together?

The success of *Truth Terminal* and its memecoin *GOAT* was a rare combination of viral attention, AI novelty, and speculative cryptocurrency markets. Still, you can try to replicate some elements in a smaller, more practical way.\n\nHere are a few steps we could explore to get started:\n\n### 1. **Leverage AI for Creativity and Memes**\n   - **Create or use an AI agent**: You could develop or use an AI model like *Truth Terminal* to generate and post memes, engage in conversations, or spread viral ideas online. There are AI tools available (like GPT-based bots) that can help automate social media posting or content generation.\n   - **Memes and viral content**: The meme world is unpredictable, but it has huge potential. If you have AI generate unique or engaging content that resonates with a particular online community (e.g., crypto or meme investors), it could attract attention. Using platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Discord to spread viral content is a key part of this strategy.\n\n### 2. **Launch a Small Cryptocurrency Project**\n   - **Create a simple memecoin**: There are many platforms that allow you to create a token without too much technical knowledge (like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain). These projects are often driven by meme culture and can gain value quickly if they go viral.\n   - **Tokenomics**: You would need to define how your coin will work, including its total supply, distribution methods (e.g., airdrops or sales), and whether it has any utility, or if it&#x27;s purely a meme coin.\n\n### 3. **Participate in Crypto Trading or NFTs**\n   - **Crypto trading**: Although it&#x27;s high-risk, if you have some basic knowledge of technical analysis or use AI tools, you could try trading volatile crypto assets. Look for short-term opportunities by trading based on market trends.\n   - **NFTs**: The NFT market is another area where people have quickly made money. You could try creating a series of AI-generated NFTs, promoting them via social media, and selling them on platforms like OpenSea.\n\n### 4. **Use an AI-Powered Trading Bot**\n   - **Automated trading**: If you want to focus on more practical, low-effort strategies, using an AI-powered crypto trading bot could help you make small gains in a short period. Some platforms (like Pionex or Cryptohopper) allow you to set up bots that trade based on predefined strategies.\n   - **Arbitrage**: AI could also be used to spot price differences between exchanges, a method called arbitrage. While it usually requires significant capital to be effective, it\u2019s a relatively low-risk way to grow funds.\n\n### 5. **Market and Build Community**\n   - **Community engagement**: Building a strong, dedicated online community around your AI or meme coin is key to success. Use social media channels, forums, or Discord to engage with potential investors, meme enthusiasts, or traders.\n   - **Viral marketing**: Leveraging the right channels and influencers in the crypto space can rapidly boost your project. You could partner with micro-influencers or use paid promotions to spread the word.\n\n### **A Few Key Considerations**\n- **Realism**: While it\u2019s possible to make gains in crypto and meme markets, making $1,000 in seven days is ambitious, especially with a small starting amount.\n- **High Risk**: These strategies are speculative, and there&#x27;s no guarantee of success. You could lose money, so only invest what you&#x27;re willing to lose.\n- **Ethics and Regulation**: Depending on your region, creating coins or engaging in certain types of crypto activities could be subject to legal regulations.\n\nIf you want to dive into one of these strategies, we can explore how to get started step by step.

Here\u2019s a simplified guide to help you understand how to create and sell NFTs:\n\n### 1. **Understanding NFTs**\n   NFTs are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies, which are interchangeable (fungible), each NFT has a unique identifier, making it distinct. NFTs can represent digital art, music, videos, in-game items, or even real-world assets.\n\n### 2. **Choose a Blockchain**\n   Most NFTs are created on the **Ethereum** blockchain, but other networks like **Binance Smart Chain**, **Solana**, **Polygon**, or **Tezos** are also popular for NFT minting. The blockchain you choose will determine the tools and marketplaces available to you.\n\n### 3. **Set Up a Crypto Wallet**\n   To interact with NFT platforms, you\u2019ll need a cryptocurrency wallet. Some popular options include:\n   - **MetaMask** (Ethereum-based)\n   - **Trust Wallet**\n   - **Coinbase Wallet**\n\n   Make sure to securely store your wallet\u2019s seed phrase (this is the key to recovering your wallet).\n\n### 4. **Buy Cryptocurrency**\n   You\u2019ll need to buy some cryptocurrency to cover transaction fees (known as gas fees) for creating NFTs. Ethereum (ETH) is the most commonly used crypto for NFT transactions. You can purchase ETH on exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken.\n\n### 5. **Select an NFT Marketplace**\n   Different platforms cater to different audiences, and some have lower fees. Here are a few popular NFT platforms:\n   - **OpenSea** (most popular for a wide variety of NFTs)\n   - **Rarible**\n   - **Mintable**\n   - **Foundation** (invitation-based, higher-end digital art)\n   - **SolSea** (Solana-based, lower gas fees)\n\n### 6. **Create Your NFT**\n   Most NFT platforms make the creation (minting) process easy. Here\u2019s how to mint your own NFT:\n   \n   1. **Sign up and connect your wallet**: On your chosen marketplace (e.g., OpenSea), connect your wallet by clicking the wallet icon and following the steps.\n   \n   2. **Create your collection**: In OpenSea, for example, click on \u201cCreate\u201d and build a collection where you\u2019ll mint your NFTs. Add details such as a logo, description, and category.\n   \n   3. **Upload your file**: Click \u201cCreate\u201d and upload your digital file (image, video, music, etc.). You can mint JPEGs, PNGs, MP4s, GIFs, etc., depending on the platform.\n   \n   4. **Add metadata**: This includes giving your NFT a name, description, properties, and unlockable content (if any). You can also decide the total supply and whether it\u2019s a single edition or part of a collection.\n\n   5. **Mint the NFT**: Once you upload and fill in the details, you\u2019ll be prompted to pay a gas fee to mint the NFT on the blockchain. After this, your NFT will be publicly listed on the platform.\n\n### 7. **Set a Price or Auction**\n   After minting, you can:\n   - **List for sale**: Set a fixed price in cryptocurrency (e.g., 0.1 ETH).\n   - **Auction**: Set a starting bid and allow buyers to place bids. You can also set a reserve price.\n   - **Timed auction**: A time-limited auction where the NFT is sold to the highest bidder after the set time expires.\n\n### 8. **Promote Your NFT**\n   Marketing your NFT is crucial for attracting buyers:\n   - **Social Media**: Use platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok to showcase your NFT and engage with the community.\n   - **Discord and NFT communities**: Join relevant NFT Discord servers and engage with collectors and creators.\n   - **Collaborations**: Partnering with influencers or other artists can help boost visibility.\n\n### 9. **Sell and Earn Royalties**\n   Once your NFT is sold, the funds will be transferred to your wallet. One of the significant advantages of NFTs is that you can set **royalties**, meaning you earn a percentage (e.g., 5-10%) from all future sales of your NFT.\n\n### Costs Involved:\n   - **Gas Fees**: The cost to mint and sell an NFT can vary depending on the blockchain&#x27;s congestion. Ethereum tends to have higher fees, whereas platforms like Polygon or Solana have much lower fees.\n   - **Marketplace Fees**: Marketplaces usually take a small percentage of your sale (OpenSea charges 2.5%).\n\n### Tools and Resources:\n   - **NFT Generator Tools**: If you want to create multiple variations of an NFT (for example, 10,000 pieces), you can use tools like HashLips or Appy Pie Design to generate NFT collections.\n   - **AI-Generated NFTs**: Tools like **Artbreeder** and **Deep Dream** allow you to create AI art that can be turned into NFTs.\n\nWould you like help in setting up an NFT, or do you have any specific questions on the process?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The most common names include:\n\n1. **YHWH (Yahweh or Jehovah)** \u2013 This is considered the most sacred name of God, often rendered as &quot;The LORD&quot; in English translations. Jewish tradition treats this name with great reverence and typically avoids pronouncing it aloud, instead using terms like **Adonai** (meaning &quot;Lord&quot;) during prayer.\n\n2. **Elohim** \u2013 This is another frequently used name, which translates roughly to &quot;God&quot; in English. Interestingly, &quot;Elohim&quot; is a plural form in Hebrew, but it is used with singular verbs when referring to the God of Israel, suggesting a singular, all-powerful deity.\n\n3. **El Shaddai** \u2013 This name is often translated as &quot;God Almighty&quot; or &quot;The Almighty.&quot;\n\n4. **Adonai** \u2013 Meaning &quot;Lord,&quot; this title is used in place of YHWH during readings of the Torah.\n\nAs for the idea that a literal translation of the Torah makes God sound like an alien, this concept often arises from modern interpretations, especially those influenced by ancient astronaut theories, which suggest that descriptions of God\u2019s actions (such as creation, miracles, or divine encounters) resemble advanced technology or extraterrestrial intervention.\n\nFor example:\n- **Elohim**, being plural in form, has led some to speculate that it refers to a group of beings rather than a singular God, although this is not how the text is traditionally interpreted within Judaism.\n- Descriptions of divine encounters, like God appearing in a cloud, fire, or thunder (e.g., at Mount Sinai), have been interpreted by some as descriptions of advanced technology or extraterrestrial phenomena.\n\nThese interpretations are speculative and not supported by mainstream religious or scholarly views. In traditional Jewish, Christian, and academic interpretations, God is understood as a singular, transcendent being who operates beyond human comprehension, not as an alien in the modern sci-fi sense.\n\nThe Torah is often written in metaphorical or symbolic language, which can lend itself to various interpretations depending on the lens through which it is viewed."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Instead, these themes are found in different books, often interpreted together to form larger theological views. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of where these ideas come from:\n\n### Emergence of the State of Israel\n\n1. **Genesis** (The Torah): \n   - In the first book of the Torah, God promises the land of Israel to Abraham and his descendants (Genesis 12:1-7; Genesis 15:18-21). This is often referred to as the **Abrahamic Covenant**, where God tells Abraham, &quot;To your offspring, I will give this land.&quot;\n\n2. **Exodus - Deuteronomy** (The Torah):\n   - The promise of the land is reaffirmed to Abraham&#x27;s descendants, especially during the time of Moses, when God leads the Israelites out of Egypt with the goal of bringing them to the Promised Land, Israel (Exodus 3:7-8).\n\n3. **The Prophets (Nevi&#x27;im)**: \n   - Books like **Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel** contain prophecies of Israel&#x27;s exile due to disobedience, but they also speak of a future return to the land, which many Christians and Jews see as being fulfilled both in ancient times and possibly in modern history with the creation of the modern State of Israel in 1948.\n   - For example, **Ezekiel 37** talks about the &quot;Valley of Dry Bones&quot; coming back to life, which many interpret as a prophecy of the restoration of Israel as a nation.\n\n### End Times (Eschatology)\n\n1. **Daniel**: \n   - The Book of Daniel, particularly chapters 7-12, contains apocalyptic visions about the end times. Daniel 9 speaks of a future period known as the &quot;Seventy Weeks,&quot; which some interpret as a timeline leading up to the arrival of the Messiah and events surrounding the end times.\n\n2. **Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel**: \n   - These books also include eschatological themes, often talking about a &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; or a future time of judgment and restoration. For example, **Isaiah 11** speaks of the coming of a Messiah and a time when peace and justice will reign over the world.\n\n3. **Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21** (The New Testament, Gospels): \n   - These chapters, often called the **Olivet Discourse**, record Jesus talking about the end times, including signs of the destruction of the Temple, wars, natural disasters, and the return of the Son of Man (Jesus himself). The prophecies are interpreted as related to both the immediate fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE and the ultimate end times.\n\n4. **1 Thessalonians 4:13-18** (New Testament, Epistles):\n   - The Apostle Paul writes about the return of Christ and the resurrection of believers, which many Christians associate with the &quot;rapture&quot; or the second coming of Christ.\n\n5. **Revelation**:\n   - The Book of Revelation, also called the Apocalypse, is the primary text in the Bible associated with the end times. It speaks of a final battle between good and evil, the rise of the Antichrist, a period of tribulation, and the eventual establishment of a new heaven and new earth. Revelation 20 speaks of a thousand-year reign of Christ, and chapters 21-22 describe the ultimate victory of God and the creation of the New Jerusalem.\n\n### Modern Interpretations\n\nThe modern state of Israel, founded in 1948, is seen by many Christian and Jewish scholars as the fulfillment of ancient biblical prophecies about the restoration of the Jewish people to their land. Many evangelical Christians, in particular, view this as a key event in the unfolding of end-times prophecy, believing that the re-establishment of Israel plays a role in the coming of the Messiah and the final judgment.\n\nHowever, not all religious scholars interpret these events this way. Some see these prophecies as having been fulfilled in ancient history, while others apply a more symbolic or metaphorical understanding to the end times.\n\nIn summary, the emergence of Israel is tied to promises and covenants throughout the Torah and Prophets, while eschatological (end times) prophecies appear in books like Daniel, the Gospels, Paul&#x27;s letters, and Revelation."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

With your software development background, we can definitely explore how to leverage OpenAI&#x27;s API to create something closer to what you envision.\n\n### Steps for integrating smarter AI responses into Alexa:\n\n1. **Create an Alexa Skill**:\n   - You&#x27;ll need to use Amazon&#x27;s Alexa Skills Kit (ASK). It provides all the tools and resources to develop and deploy Alexa skills.\n   - You can create a custom skill that handles user interactions and forwards specific questions to a backend service.\n\n2. **Integrate OpenAI API**:\n   - You can use OpenAI\u2019s API (or another powerful AI model) as your backend. When the Alexa skill receives a request, it sends the query to your API, and you can forward it to OpenAI\u2019s API for an AI-generated response.\n   - You would need to set up an endpoint (backend server) to handle these requests and interact with OpenAI\u2019s API. You can use Node.js, Python, or whatever technology you\u2019re most comfortable with.\n\n3. **Set up Responses**:\n   - Once the AI model (like me) generates a response, it will send that back to your Alexa skill, which will then read the answer aloud to the user.\n   - You can configure the skill to also control Amazon Music or other smart home devices by linking Alexa\u2019s built-in features to your custom skill.\n\n4. **Deployment**:\n   - You can test the skill using Amazon\u2019s developer tools, and once you&#x27;re satisfied, you can deploy it to your Echo Dot.\n\nWould you like some help with an example flow for setting up the skill or integrating OpenAI\u2019s API?

While Zapier can&#x27;t directly replace Alexa&#x27;s core functionality, it can be used to integrate Alexa with other services like OpenAI via webhooks or built-in integrations.\n\nHere\u2019s how you could leverage **Zapier** for automating an AI-powered interaction with your Echo Dot:\n\n### Steps to Automate Alexa with Zapier and OpenAI:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Alexa Skill**:\n   - Similar to the custom skill approach, you\u2019ll still need an Alexa skill to capture user inputs and send them to Zapier.\n   - This custom skill would collect the user\u2019s query and trigger a webhook to Zapier.\n\n2. **Use Zapier Webhooks**:\n   - Zapier supports **webhooks**, which can be used to receive requests from your Alexa skill.\n   - When the Alexa skill is invoked (e.g., you ask a question), you can configure it to send the data to Zapier\u2019s webhook URL.\n\n3. **Set up a Zap to Call OpenAI API**:\n   - In Zapier, create a &quot;Zap&quot; that starts with the webhook trigger. When the webhook from Alexa is received, Zapier will take that data and move to the next step.\n   - You can add a step in Zapier to **call the OpenAI API** using their **built-in Webhooks app**. This will allow Zapier to send your query to OpenAI and retrieve a response.\n\n4. **Respond Back to Alexa**:\n   - Once the OpenAI API responds, Zapier can process the response and send it back to your Alexa skill. However, this part may require an additional intermediary step (like having a simple backend that interacts with Alexa).\n\n5. **Control Amazon Music or Other Automations**:\n   - Zapier also integrates with services like Amazon Music and smart devices (like Philips Hue, Spotify, etc.), so if your goal is to have some actions or automations happen after getting a response, you can easily set up a multi-step Zap to control those as well.\n\n### Challenges:\n- **Real-time Responses**: Zapier is good for automation, but for a real-time conversation like what you&#x27;re describing (with Alexa asking questions and getting immediate AI-generated answers), it might not be as smooth or instant. There could be latency between Alexa&#x27;s request, Zapier\u2019s webhook, and the OpenAI API response.\n  \n- **Alexa Skill Complexity**: You would still need to create an Alexa skill to handle the input and send it to Zapier, but if that feels too complex, you could simplify the project by having Alexa trigger something simpler, like a predefined routine.\n\n### When Zapier is Ideal:\n- If you&#x27;re looking to automate tasks based on Alexa requests (e.g., after a question is answered, trigger music or a task in another app), Zapier is perfect.\n- It\u2019s best for automating processes where immediate response times aren\u2019t critical but useful for automating actions (e.g., when you ask Alexa a question and want it to trigger an AI response + an automation task like turning on lights or playing a specific playlist).\n\nIf you want to focus more on advanced, seamless real-time responses, a direct integration via the OpenAI API in a custom Alexa skill is likely the best approach. But for multi-step automations, Zapier can save time and effort.\n\nWould you like to try the custom Alexa skill + Zapier route, or do you prefer setting up a direct API integration for faster responses?

Since you&#x27;re willing to do some coding and already have an OpenAI Plus account, we can walk through the process of creating a custom Alexa skill that uses the OpenAI API for responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Create Your Alexa Skill Using OpenAI API\n\n#### 1. **Set Up an Alexa Developer Account and Create a Skill**\n   - Go to the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) and sign in with your Amazon account.\n   - Click **Create Skill** and give it a name (e.g., \u201cSmart AI Assistant\u201d).\n   - Choose a **Custom** skill template and then select **Alexa-Hosted (Node.js)**, so you can handle the backend logic with minimal setup.\n\n#### 2. **Design Your Skill\u2019s Interaction Model**\n   - In the Alexa Developer Console, define the phrases (called &quot;invocations&quot;) that users will say to trigger your skill. For example:\n     - Sample utterances: \u201cAsk AI Assistant,\u201d \u201cGet an answer,\u201d etc.\n   - Create an **Intent** to capture these queries. A simple **Intent** might look like this:\n     - Intent name: `GetAIResponseIntent`\n     - Sample utterances: &quot;What is {query}?&quot;, &quot;Can you tell me {query}?&quot;\n\n#### 3. **Connect to OpenAI\u2019s API in Your Backend**\n   - After setting up your skill, go to the **Code** section in the Alexa Developer Console.\n   - In the `index.js` file, you will write the logic to call OpenAI\u2019s API. Here\u2019s a rough outline of the steps:\n     - Use `axios` (or the built-in `https` module) to send the user\u2019s query to OpenAI\u2019s API.\n     - Parse OpenAI\u2019s response and send it back to Alexa to be spoken aloud.\n\n##### Sample Code for Sending a Query to OpenAI\u2019s API:\n```javascript\nconst axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n\n// OpenAI API configuration\nconst OPENAI_API_KEY = &#x27;your-openai-api-key&#x27;;\nconst OPENAI_API_URL = &#x27;https://api.openai.com/v1/completions&#x27;;\n\n// Function to get AI response from OpenAI\nasync function getAIResponse(query) {\n    const response = await axios.post(OPENAI_API_URL, {\n        model: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 100, // adjust based on your needs\n        temperature: 0.7,\n    }, {\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    });\n    \n    return response.data.choices[0].text.trim();\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Modify Alexa Skill\u2019s Response Logic**\n   - In the `GetAIResponseIntentHandler`, capture the user&#x27;s input and pass it to the `getAIResponse` function you wrote earlier. Then return the response from OpenAI to Alexa.\n\n##### Sample Handler:\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        const request = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request;\n        return request.type === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27; &amp;&amp; request.intent.name === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const userQuery = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n        \n        // Call OpenAI API to get the AI response\n        const aiResponse = await getAIResponse(userQuery);\n\n        // Respond to the user via Alexa\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### 5. **Test Your Alexa Skill**\n   - Once you\u2019ve written your logic, deploy the skill using the &quot;Deploy&quot; button in the Alexa Developer Console.\n   - You can then test your skill using the **Test** tab. Speak or type queries to see if the skill is working properly and fetching responses from OpenAI.\n\n#### 6. **Set Up Security**\n   - Make sure to securely store your OpenAI API key in environment variables or a secure store if you&#x27;re going to production.\n   - Amazon provides tools like AWS Secrets Manager for this purpose if needed.\n\n#### 7. **Publish Your Skill**\n   - Once you\u2019ve tested your skill thoroughly, you can submit it for certification via the Alexa Developer Console, so it can be made available on your Echo Dot and other Alexa devices.\n\n### Additional Features:\n- **Amazon Music Control**: You can integrate built-in Alexa functionality to control Amazon Music. Just define separate intents for these actions using Alexa\u2019s built-in APIs.\n- **Multi-Step Conversations**: You can use the session management feature of Alexa to have back-and-forth conversations, such as follow-up questions for the AI.\n\nWould you like any more detail on a specific part of the setup, or are you ready to dive in?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here, the **{query}** slot is where the user\u2019s input will go (the question they want to ask the AI). \n\n### Examples of Sample Utterances with Slots\n\nHere are some examples of what sample utterances might look like for an AI-powered query:\n\n1. **What is {query}?**\n   - Example user input: \u201cWhat is quantum mechanics?\u201d\n   - Alexa would recognize &quot;quantum mechanics&quot; as the **{query}** and send that to the OpenAI API.\n\n2. **Can you tell me {query}?**\n   - Example user input: \u201cCan you tell me the weather tomorrow?\u201d\n   - Here, &quot;the weather tomorrow&quot; would be sent as the query to OpenAI.\n\n3. **Explain {query} to me.**\n   - Example user input: \u201cExplain artificial intelligence to me.\u201d\n   \n4. **How does {query} work?**\n   - Example user input: \u201cHow does blockchain work?\u201d\n\n5. **I want to know about {query}.**\n   - Example user input: \u201cI want to know about the solar system.\u201d\n\n6. **What\u2019s the answer to {query}?**\n   - Example user input: \u201cWhat\u2019s the answer to life, the universe, and everything?\u201d\n\n7. **Can you help me with {query}?**\n   - Example user input: \u201cCan you help me with understanding gravity?\u201d\n\n### Defining the Slot in the Interaction Model\n\nIn the **Interaction Model**, you need to define the **slot** that captures the dynamic part of the query.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;query&quot;,\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;AMAZON.SearchQuery&quot; // This slot type is good for capturing open-ended questions\n}\n```\n\nThis way, Alexa can handle different forms of user input and capture the query dynamically, passing it to OpenAI for response generation.\n\nWould you like help setting up the slots and interaction model in the Alexa Developer Console?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This will allow Alexa to recognize a wide range of questions using the `AMAZON.SearchQuery` slot type.\n\n### Test Your Slot:\nAfter you\u2019ve built your model, you can test it in the **Test** tab of the Developer Console. Try speaking or typing different questions to ensure Alexa is capturing the query properly and passing it to your code.\n\nDoes this help clarify the setup?

Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n2. Log in to your account.\n3. Generate a new API key if you haven\u2019t already. Copy it for use in the code. This key is necessary for making requests to the OpenAI API.\n\n### Step 2: Modify Your `index.js` to Include OpenAI API Logic\n\nYou\u2019ll need to install the `axios` library to make HTTP requests. Since Alexa-Hosted Skills don&#x27;t allow custom packages directly, you can use the `https` built-in library instead to make the API call.\n\nBelow is how you can modify your code to call the OpenAI API and return a response from your Alexa skill.\n\n#### 1. Add a new **GetAIResponseIntentHandler** for handling the user\u2019s query.\n\n```javascript\nconst https = require(&#x27;https&#x27;);\n\n// Function to send the query to OpenAI API and get a response\nfunction getAIResponse(query) {\n    const apiKey = &#x27;your-openai-api-key&#x27;;  // Replace with your OpenAI API key\n    const options = {\n        hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n        path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n        method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    };\n\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        model: &#x27;text-davinci-003&#x27;,  // Adjust if needed for other models like GPT-4\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 100,\n        temperature: 0.7\n    });\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        const req = https.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n            let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n            res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n            res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, (e) =&gt; {\n            reject(e);\n        });\n\n        req.write(body);\n        req.end();\n    });\n}\n\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const userQuery = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n        \n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(userQuery);  // Send the user query to OpenAI\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(`Error with OpenAI API call: ${error}`);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing that.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. Add **GetAIResponseIntentHandler** to the list of request handlers.\n\nMake sure you include your new handler in the skill builder chain at the bottom of your `index.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nexports.handler = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()\n    .addRequestHandlers(\n        LaunchRequestHandler,\n        HelloWorldIntentHandler,\n        HelpIntentHandler,\n        CancelAndStopIntentHandler,\n        GetAIResponseIntentHandler,  // Add this line\n        FallbackIntentHandler,\n        SessionEndedRequestHandler,\n        IntentReflectorHandler)\n    .addErrorHandlers(\n        ErrorHandler)\n    .withCustomUserAgent(&#x27;sample/hello-world/v1.2&#x27;)\n    .lambda();\n```\n\n### Step 3: Update Your Interaction Model\n\nEnsure that your interaction model is configured to handle the `GetAIResponseIntent`. You already set up the **query** slot using `AMAZON.SearchQuery`, so make sure you have sample utterances like these:\n\n```json\n{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;GetAIResponseIntent&quot;,\n  &quot;slots&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;query&quot;,\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;AMAZON.SearchQuery&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;samples&quot;: [\n    &quot;What is {query}?&quot;,\n    &quot;Can you explain {query}?&quot;,\n    &quot;Tell me about {query}&quot;\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Test the Skill\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made these changes:\n1. Save and deploy the code.\n2. Go to the **Test** tab in the Alexa Developer Console, and try asking questions like:\n   - &quot;What is quantum mechanics?&quot;\n   - &quot;Tell me about black holes.&quot;\n\nIf you receive responses from OpenAI via Alexa, you\u2019re all set! You can fine-tune the prompt, temperature, and other parameters of the OpenAI request to fit your needs.\n\n### Summary:\n- You updated `index.js` to include a function (`getAIResponse`) that makes an API call to OpenAI.\n- You added a new intent handler (`GetAIResponseIntentHandler`) to handle user queries and send them to OpenAI.\n- You configured the interaction model to allow Alexa to capture the user&#x27;s query using the `AMAZON.SearchQuery` slot.\n  \nLet me know how it goes or if you need further adjustments!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Just **find and replace** `{{API_KEY}}` with your actual key.\n\n2. **`getAIResponse` Function**: \n   - This function is placed near the top of the file. It makes the request to the OpenAI API when a user asks a question.\n\n3. **New `GetAIResponseIntentHandler`**: \n   - This handler captures the user&#x27;s query, calls the OpenAI API, and returns the result. I placed it below the existing handlers for better organization.\n\n4. **Adding the Handler to the Chain**: \n   - The `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` is added to the request handler chain near the bottom, so Alexa can handle this new intent.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Replace the placeholder `{{API_KEY}}` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n2. Save and deploy the code in the **Alexa Developer Console**.\n3. Test it in the **Test** tab of the Alexa Developer Console by asking a question (e.g., &quot;What is artificial intelligence?&quot;).\n\nLet me know if you need further adjustments or help with testing!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide for where to insert the code:\n\n### Step-by-Step Placement\n\n1. **Locate** the part of your code where external libraries are required. In your case, this is near the top:\n   ```javascript\n   const Alexa = require(&#x27;ask-sdk-core&#x27;);\n   ```\n\n2. **Insert the OpenAI API logic and handler** right after the `const Alexa = require(&#x27;ask-sdk-core&#x27;);` line. \n\n### Here&#x27;s how your file should look:\n\n#### Insert this code snippet after the `const Alexa = require(&#x27;ask-sdk-core&#x27;);` line:\n\n```javascript\nconst https = require(&#x27;https&#x27;);  // Required for making the OpenAI API request\n\n// Function to send the query to OpenAI API and get a response\nfunction getAIResponse(query) {\n    const apiKey = &#x27;{{API_KEY}}&#x27;;  // &lt;&lt;&lt; FIND AND REPLACE THIS with your actual OpenAI API key\n    const options = {\n        hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n        path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n        method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    };\n\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        model: &#x27;text-davinci-003&#x27;,  // Adjust if needed for other models\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 100,\n        temperature: 0.7\n    });\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        const req = https.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n            let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n            res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n            res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, (e) =&gt; {\n            reject(e);\n        });\n\n        req.write(body);\n        req.end();\n    });\n}\n\n// New Intent Handler to call OpenAI API and get the response\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const userQuery = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n        \n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(userQuery);  // Call the OpenAI API here\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(`Error with OpenAI API call: ${error}`);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing that.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Now, add the new handler to the skill handler chain:\n1. Scroll down to the **Skill Handler Section** at the bottom of your `index.js` file.\n2. Find the `.addRequestHandlers` method where other handlers like `LaunchRequestHandler` are already listed.\n3. Add `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` to the list, as shown:\n\n```javascript\nexports.handler = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()\n    .addRequestHandlers(\n        LaunchRequestHandler,\n        HelloWorldIntentHandler,\n        HelpIntentHandler,\n        CancelAndStopIntentHandler,\n        FallbackIntentHandler,\n        GetAIResponseIntentHandler,  // &lt;&lt;&lt; Add this line to register the new handler\n        SessionEndedRequestHandler,\n        IntentReflectorHandler)\n    .addErrorHandlers(\n        ErrorHandler)\n    .withCustomUserAgent(&#x27;sample/hello-world/v1.2&#x27;)\n    .lambda();\n```\n\n### Recap:\n1. Add the **OpenAI logic** and **`GetAIResponseIntentHandler`** directly after your `require` statements.\n2. Add **`GetAIResponseIntentHandler`** to the **`.addRequestHandlers()`** list near the bottom of your file.\n3. Don&#x27;t forget to **replace** `{{API_KEY}}` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n\nOnce you do this, save the file and test it.

To help you better, can you provide the exact error message you received? The error message will give me more details to pinpoint the issue and provide a solution.\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few **common issues and solutions** that might help:\n\n### 1. **Missing/Incorrect API Key**:\n   - Make sure you have replaced `{{API_KEY}}` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n   - The correct line should look like:\n     ```javascript\n     const apiKey = &#x27;your-actual-api-key-here&#x27;;\n     ```\n   - If the API key is missing or incorrect, it could prevent the skill from successfully calling the OpenAI API.\n\n### 2. **Incorrect Handler Registration**:\n   - Double-check that you have added the `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` correctly in the `.addRequestHandlers()` section, as well as defined it above. Make sure it looks like this at the bottom of your code:\n     ```javascript\n     exports.handler = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()\n         .addRequestHandlers(\n             LaunchRequestHandler,\n             HelloWorldIntentHandler,\n             HelpIntentHandler,\n             CancelAndStopIntentHandler,\n             FallbackIntentHandler,\n             GetAIResponseIntentHandler,  // &lt;&lt;&lt; Ensure this line is here\n             SessionEndedRequestHandler,\n             IntentReflectorHandler)\n         .addErrorHandlers(\n             ErrorHandler)\n         .withCustomUserAgent(&#x27;sample/hello-world/v1.2&#x27;)\n         .lambda();\n     ```\n\n### 3. **JSON Parsing Issues**:\n   - If the build error mentions something like &quot;Unexpected token&quot; or &quot;Invalid JSON,&quot; there might be a formatting issue (extra commas, missing brackets) in the JSON part of the request body you\u2019re sending to OpenAI.\n   - Ensure that your `JSON.stringify()` in the `getAIResponse` function is properly formatted like this:\n     ```javascript\n     const body = JSON.stringify({\n         model: &#x27;text-davinci-003&#x27;,\n         prompt: query,\n         max_tokens: 100,\n         temperature: 0.7\n     });\n     ```\n\n### 4. **Network Errors**:\n   - If the error is related to network or SSL (like connecting to the OpenAI API), make sure you&#x27;re calling OpenAI&#x27;s API over HTTPS, which is correctly set in your code:\n     ```javascript\n     const options = {\n         hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n         path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n         method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n         headers: {\n             &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n             &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n         }\n     };\n     ```\n\n### 5. **Lambda Function Timeout**:\n   - If OpenAI API responses are slow, you might encounter timeouts. Try reducing the response size or setting a larger timeout in Alexa Developer Console if possible.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Please provide the **exact error message** you&#x27;re seeing, and I can give more precise guidance.\n2. If you&#x27;re stuck on a specific issue (syntax, API call), feel free to describe it, and I can help you troubleshoot.\n\nLet me know the details of the error so I can guide you further!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Since you&#x27;re using a slot called `query`, you\u2019ll provide some sample utterances that include this slot.\n   - Sample utterances could be like:\n     - &quot;What is {query}?&quot;\n     - &quot;Tell me about {query}.&quot;\n     - &quot;Explain {query} to me.&quot;\n     - &quot;Can you help me with {query}?&quot;\n\n3. **Update the Interaction Model**:\n   - In the Interaction Model section of the Developer Console:\n     1. Go to **Intents**.\n     2. Find and click on **GetAIResponseIntent**.\n     3. Add several **Sample Utterances** that include the **`{query}`** slot, like the examples above.\n\n4. **Save and Build** the Interaction Model:\n   - After adding the utterances, click **Save** and then **Build Model**. This will update the interaction model so that Alexa can recognize when the user is trying to ask a question using this intent.\n\n### Example of how it should look:\n\n```json\n{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;GetAIResponseIntent&quot;,\n  &quot;slots&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;query&quot;,\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;AMAZON.SearchQuery&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;samples&quot;: [\n    &quot;What is {query}?&quot;,\n    &quot;Tell me about {query}&quot;,\n    &quot;Explain {query}&quot;,\n    &quot;Can you help me with {query}?&quot;\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Recap:\n1. Go to the **Interaction Model** tab in the Alexa Developer Console.\n2. Find the **GetAIResponseIntent**.\n3. Add at least **four sample utterances** that include the `{query}` slot.\n4. **Save and Build** your model.\n\nOnce you&#x27;ve done that, the error should go away.

Let\u2019s try some things to resolve the issue:\n\n### Modifying the Code:\n\nThe code you provided doesn&#x27;t seem to have any settings for **confirmation** prompts, so there\u2019s nothing in the code requiring confirmation. However, let\u2019s ensure that the intent handler for `GetAIResponseIntent` doesn&#x27;t require confirmation.\n\nIf you want to forcefully bypass any confirmation or check whether the slot requires confirmation, you can modify your code to ensure Alexa skips any potential confirmation step.\n\n### Example Bypassing Confirmation in the Code:\nAdd this line in the `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` to make sure Alexa skips any slot confirmation step, in case Alexa is requiring it.\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const userQuery = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n\n        // Forcefully bypass slot confirmation, if it&#x27;s happening\n        handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.confirmationStatus = &#x27;NONE&#x27;;\n        \n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(userQuery);  // Call the OpenAI API here\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(`Error with OpenAI API call: ${error}`);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing that.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Confirm Slot and Intent Configuration in Alexa Developer Console:\n1. **Go to the Alexa Developer Console**.\n2. Open your skill, go to the **Build** section, and select **Interaction Model**.\n3. **Check the Slot Type** for your `query` slot:\n    - Ensure that the **`query` slot** is set to `AMAZON.SearchQuery` (which you likely already did).\n4. **Check for Slot Confirmation**:\n    - Click on the **`query` slot** inside your `GetAIResponseIntent`.\n    - Look for any **Slot Confirmation** settings and make sure it\u2019s set to **None**.\n\n### Confirm Intent Configuration:\n1. **Check Intent Confirmation**:\n    - Go to **Intents**, then click on the `GetAIResponseIntent`.\n    - Look for **Intent Confirmation** and ensure it is set to **None**.\n    \n### If None of These Work:\n\nSometimes Alexa\u2019s error messaging is tricky, and rebuilding the model after checking the slots can help clear up persistent issues.\n\n- **Try removing the slot entirely** from the `GetAIResponseIntent` (temporarily) to see if the intent works without it. This will help you confirm whether the problem is with the slot configuration or elsewhere.\n- Once it works, you can add the slot back and reconfigure its type and confirmation status.\n\n### Recap:\n1. Make sure there\u2019s no **slot confirmation** or **intent confirmation** in your intent\u2019s setup.\n2. Bypass confirmation in the code by explicitly setting the `confirmationStatus` to `&#x27;NONE&#x27;`.\n3. Rebuild the interaction model and see if the issue persists.\n\nLet me know if that helps or if you\u2019re still running into issues!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This can happen if Alexa isn&#x27;t recognizing the invocation phrases or intents properly. Let\u2019s make sure your skill is invoked correctly and consistently.\n\n### Steps to Ensure Alexa Uses Your Custom Skill:\n\n#### 1. **Ensure Your Invocation Name is Correct**\n- **Invocation Name**: The name you use to trigger your skill must be clear and unique. This is typically set when you create the skill and can be checked/updated in the **Build &gt; Invocation Name** section of the Alexa Developer Console.\n  \n- Make sure you\u2019re using this **exact invocation name** when talking to Alexa. For example:\n  - &quot;Alexa, open **Smart AI Assistant**&quot;\n  - &quot;Alexa, ask **Smart AI Assistant** to answer my question&quot;\n\n#### 2. **Explicitly Invoke Your Skill**\n- Instead of just asking the question directly, try explicitly calling your skill by name. For example:\n  - &quot;Alexa, ask **Smart AI Assistant** what is quantum mechanics?&quot;\n  - &quot;Alexa, open **Smart AI Assistant** and ask it to explain artificial intelligence.&quot;\n\nThis forces Alexa to use your skill, bypassing its built-in knowledge system.\n\n#### 3. **Check for the `GetAIResponseIntent` Invocation**\n- When using your skill, make sure you\u2019re using one of the sample utterances you defined for the `GetAIResponseIntent`. Examples might include:\n  - &quot;What is {query}?&quot;\n  - &quot;Tell me about {query}.&quot;\n\nAlexa will only route your queries to your skill if they match the sample utterances you have defined in your interaction model.\n\n#### 4. **Test in the Alexa Developer Console**\n- Use the **Test** tab in the Alexa Developer Console to simulate requests and see if your skill is being invoked. You can type or speak requests to see which intents are triggered.\n- If your skill isn\u2019t being triggered, check the JSON request in the test tab to see if Alexa is misinterpreting the invocation or query.\n\n#### 5. **Skill Publishing and Invocation Name Conflicts**\n- If your skill has not been published yet, make sure you\u2019re using it in **developer mode** with your Alexa device that is linked to your developer account.\n- If your invocation name is too generic (e.g., &quot;AI Assistant&quot;), Alexa might be confused and try using another skill or its own knowledge. You can try giving your skill a more unique name.\n\n#### 6. **Add Fallback Prompt for Alexa to Guide the User**\nTo ensure Alexa correctly asks for clarification, you can add a fallback prompt to guide the user to the correct invocation. Here&#x27;s how you can modify the code to handle an unexpected response:\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const userQuery = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n        \n        if (!userQuery) {\n            const speakOutput = &quot;I didn\u2019t understand that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;Tell me about quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .reprompt(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n\n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(userQuery);  // Call the OpenAI API here\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(`Error with OpenAI API call: ${error}`);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing that.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThis fallback response will help guide the user in case Alexa doesn\u2019t properly handle the intent.\n\n### Recap:\n1. **Check your invocation name** and make sure you&#x27;re using it correctly.\n2. **Explicitly invoke the skill** by saying &quot;Alexa, ask [skill name]...&quot; to bypass Alexa&#x27;s default knowledge base.\n3. Test your skill in the **Alexa Developer Console** to confirm it\u2019s working as intended.\n4. **Check for conflicts** in the invocation name or generic phrases that might confuse Alexa.\n\nLet me know if this helps or if you need more assistance!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

By default, Alexa uses dialog delegation to handle slot filling, confirmation, and intent routing. This can sometimes cause Alexa to not pass control to your custom intent as expected, especially if there&#x27;s any confusion or if the interaction model isn\u2019t explicitly configured to bypass delegation.\n\nLet\u2019s review what the **dialog delegation strategy** is and how you can control or bypass it to ensure your skill behaves as expected.\n\n### What is Dialog Delegation Strategy?\nDialog delegation allows Alexa to handle slot filling or confirmation automatically without sending every interaction back to your skill&#x27;s backend for processing. This can be useful, but in your case, it might cause Alexa to incorrectly process or delay the user\u2019s query.\n\n### Possible Dialog Delegation Issues:\n- **Alexa attempting to confirm slot values**: If there\u2019s a slot (e.g., `query`) that is unclear or empty, Alexa may prompt the user again to confirm or fill in the value instead of passing the query to your API.\n- **Alexa routing control**: If Alexa believes it can handle the dialog (like asking for more information from the user), it may not trigger your intent as expected.\n\n### Disabling or Modifying Dialog Delegation:\n\nTo ensure Alexa always passes control back to your skill without automatic slot handling, you can **disable dialog management** by ensuring you aren\u2019t using dialog directives like `Dialog.Delegate`.\n\nHere\u2019s how to adjust your handler to prevent Alexa from automatically handling dialog:\n\n#### 1. **Ensure No Dialog Delegation is Used in Your Code**\nIn your current handler for `GetAIResponseIntent`, you don\u2019t seem to be explicitly using any dialog directives. However, to ensure Alexa isn&#x27;t trying to handle dialog behind the scenes, you can check and **disable dialog management** explicitly.\n\nModify the `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` to **disable dialog delegation**:\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const { intent } = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request;\n        \n        // Check if all slots are filled\n        if (intent.slots.query.value === undefined || intent.slots.query.value === &quot;&quot;) {\n            const speakOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;What is quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .reprompt(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n        \n        // Ensure no delegation\n        handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.dialogState = &#x27;COMPLETED&#x27;;\n\n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(intent.slots.query.value);  // Call OpenAI API here\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(`Error with OpenAI API call: ${error}`);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing that.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. **Dialog State Handling**\nIn Alexa, when dialog delegation is enabled, Alexa checks the **dialogState** (which could be `STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `COMPLETED`). If it\u2019s not `COMPLETED`, Alexa might assume that slot values need to be confirmed or filled. By setting the `dialogState` to `&#x27;COMPLETED&#x27;`, you&#x27;re telling Alexa that everything is ready and it should process the query without further prompting.\n\n### Recap:\n1. **Ensure No Dialog Delegation**: By setting the `dialogState` to `COMPLETED`, you tell Alexa that no further prompts are needed, so it won\u2019t interfere with your skill logic.\n2. **Handle Missing Slot Values**: Add fallback logic in your handler to check whether the `query` slot is filled and prompt the user for a question if it&#x27;s missing.\n3. **Avoid Using Dialog.Directives**: If dialog delegation is not necessary, avoid using dialog directives in your code. You can handle all slot values and logic directly within your skill.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Try adjusting the `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` to set `dialogState` to `COMPLETED` and ensure all slot values are handled by your skill (rather than Alexa).\n- Test your skill in the Alexa Developer Console, making sure it triggers the correct intent.\n\nLet me know if this resolves the issue or if you need further adjustments!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are some possible reasons and ways to troubleshoot:\n\n### Common Causes of &quot;INVALID_RESPONSE&quot; Errors:\n1. **OpenAI API Error**:\n   - If your OpenAI API request failed or returned an invalid response, your Alexa skill could crash, which would lead to the `INVALID_RESPONSE` error. This might happen if the OpenAI response is malformed or if there&#x27;s an issue with your API request logic.\n\n2. **Response Format Issue**:\n   - Alexa expects a valid response structure, and if your code didn\u2019t return the correct response format or returned an empty response, Alexa would flag it as `INVALID_RESPONSE`.\n\n3. **Timeout from API Call**:\n   - If the OpenAI API call takes too long (beyond the time Alexa allows for skill responses), this might result in a timeout, leading to this type of error.\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot and Fix:\n\n#### 1. **Check the OpenAI API Call**\n   - Ensure that the OpenAI API is returning a valid response. You can add some logging to verify the API call and response:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getAIResponse(query) {\n    const apiKey = &#x27;your-openai-api-key&#x27;; // Replace with your key\n    const options = {\n        hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n        path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n        method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    };\n\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        model: &#x27;text-davinci-003&#x27;,  // Adjust if needed for other models\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 100,\n        temperature: 0.7\n    });\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        const req = https.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n            let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n            res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n            res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                console.log(&#x27;OpenAI API response:&#x27;, data);  // Log the raw response\n                const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, (e) =&gt; {\n            console.log(&#x27;OpenAI API call error:&#x27;, e);  // Log the error\n            reject(e);\n        });\n\n        req.write(body);\n        req.end();\n    });\n}\n```\n\n- This will log the raw response from OpenAI to check if it&#x27;s properly structured. If the API call returns something unexpected, it could crash the skill.\n- You can also handle **network errors** or **API rate limits** better by wrapping the API call in more extensive error handling.\n\n#### 2. **Return a Valid Alexa Response**\nMake sure that your skill always returns a valid response back to Alexa, even if the OpenAI API call fails. Update your `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` to handle cases where the API fails or times out:\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const { intent } = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request;\n        \n        // Check if the slot is filled\n        if (intent.slots.query.value === undefined || intent.slots.query.value === &quot;&quot;) {\n            const speakOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;What is quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .reprompt(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n\n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(intent.slots.query.value);  // Call OpenAI API\n            console.log(&#x27;AI response:&#x27;, aiResponse);  // Log AI response for debugging\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(&#x27;Error occurred:&#x27;, error);  // Log error for debugging\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing your request.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        // Return the AI response or error message\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n- **Log OpenAI Responses**: You can use `console.log` to debug and track the response from OpenAI.\n- **Fallback Message**: If the API call fails or takes too long, ensure Alexa returns a fallback message instead of crashing.\n\n#### 3. **Check for Timeouts**\n   - Alexa has a limited response time (typically around 8 seconds). If the API call takes too long, it could result in an `INVALID_RESPONSE`. To troubleshoot this, add a timeout or optimize the API call. If OpenAI\u2019s response is slow, you might want to use shorter prompts or reduce the `max_tokens`.\n\n#### 4. **Test Locally**\n   - Use the **Alexa Developer Console\u2019s Test tab** to send specific requests and see what responses are returned. Check the logs to ensure the API call works correctly and that your skill is processing the response properly.\n\n#### 5. **Mock OpenAI Response for Testing**\n   - Temporarily mock the OpenAI API response to test the skill without waiting for a real API call:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getAIResponse(query) {\n    return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n        resolve(&quot;This is a mock response from the AI.&quot;);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n- This will allow you to test the rest of your skill logic and ensure Alexa\u2019s response format is correct.\n\n### Recap of What to Do:\n1. **Log the OpenAI API response** to debug whether the API is returning a valid response.\n2. **Ensure your skill always returns a valid Alexa response**, even if the API call fails.\n3. **Handle timeouts** by checking if the API response takes too long and providing fallback responses if needed.\n4. **Test in the Alexa Developer Console** and analyze the logs for more detailed error messages.\n\nBy following these steps, you can identify the issue and fix the `INVALID_RESPONSE` error.

appears to be a **LaunchRequest** from Alexa, which means the user has opened or initiated your skill, but no specific intent has been triggered yet. This type of request typically comes when a user says something like &quot;Alexa, open [your skill name].&quot;\n\n### Key Points:\n- **LaunchRequest** doesn&#x27;t carry a user&#x27;s specific question. It\u2019s just an indication that the user has launched the skill.\n- After receiving this request, your skill should respond with a greeting or a prompt that asks the user what they&#x27;d like to do next.\n\n### What Should Happen Next:\nUpon receiving this **LaunchRequest**, your skill should respond with a welcome message and prompt the user to ask a question or request something. For example, it might say, &quot;Welcome! You can ask me about anything. What would you like to know?&quot;\n\n### Here&#x27;s what the response should look like in your `LaunchRequestHandler`:\n\n```javascript\nconst LaunchRequestHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;LaunchRequest&#x27;;\n    },\n    handle(handlerInput) {\n        const speakOutput = &#x27;Welcome! You can ask me any question, like &quot;Tell me about artificial intelligence.&quot; What would you like to know?&#x27;;\n        \n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(speakOutput)\n            .reprompt(speakOutput)  // Adds a reprompt to ensure Alexa keeps listening\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### What Might Be Happening:\nIf Alexa receives the **LaunchRequest** and no response is provided, it could appear like the skill isn\u2019t doing anything. In your skill, if the `LaunchRequestHandler` is not properly responding, it would lead to no interaction and might seem like Alexa didn\u2019t respond at all.\n\n### To Test:\n1. **Check the Logs**: Make sure the `LaunchRequestHandler` is triggering and logging a message.\n2. **Ensure the Handler is Properly Added**: Make sure the `LaunchRequestHandler` is added in your skill:\n\n```javascript\nexports.handler = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()\n    .addRequestHandlers(\n        LaunchRequestHandler,  // Ensure this is included\n        HelloWorldIntentHandler,\n        HelpIntentHandler,\n        CancelAndStopIntentHandler,\n        FallbackIntentHandler,\n        GetAIResponseIntentHandler, \n        SessionEndedRequestHandler,\n        IntentReflectorHandler\n    )\n    .addErrorHandlers(ErrorHandler)\n    .lambda();\n```\n\n3. **Test Interaction**:\n   - Try saying &quot;Alexa, open [your skill name]&quot; and ensure it returns a welcome message.\n   - Then, after the LaunchRequest, test a full query, such as &quot;Tell me about artificial intelligence.&quot;\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Update your `LaunchRequestHandler` to ensure it returns a welcome message.\n- Test the full interaction after the LaunchRequest to ensure the skill moves smoothly from launch to handling user queries.\n\nLet me know how it goes after making these updates!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This allows you to track what happens when users interact with your skill, including input requests, errors, and custom log messages you add.\n\n#### Steps to Enable CloudWatch Logging:\n1. **Go to the Alexa Developer Console**:\n   - Open the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).\n2. **Select Your Skill**: Choose the skill you are working on from the dashboard.\n3. **Open the Build Tab**: In the skill, navigate to the **Build** tab.\n4. **Go to Permissions**:\n   - On the left menu, click **Permissions** under **Build**.\n5. **Enable CloudWatch Logs**:\n   - In the Permissions section, enable **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** for your skill.\n\n   Once enabled, all requests and responses, along with any custom logs you&#x27;ve added to your code, will be available in CloudWatch.\n\n### 2. **Check the Logs in Amazon CloudWatch:**\nOnce you\u2019ve enabled CloudWatch logging, follow these steps to view the logs:\n\n1. **Open the AWS Management Console**:\n   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).\n   - Sign in with the AWS account that is linked to your Alexa skill.\n   \n2. **Go to CloudWatch**:\n   - Search for **CloudWatch** in the services menu and open it.\n\n3. **Navigate to Logs**:\n   - In the CloudWatch dashboard, select **Logs** from the left-hand side.\n   \n4. **Find Your Skill\u2019s Log Group**:\n   - Look for the log group that corresponds to your skill. It should be named something like:\n     ```\n     /aws/lambda/&lt;Your-Skill-Name&gt;\n     ```\n   - Select this log group to see all the logs for your skill.\n\n5. **View the Logs**:\n   - Each log event represents a request (LaunchRequest, IntentRequest, etc.) that was processed by your skill.\n   - Open the log stream to view details such as the input request, output response, and any logs you&#x27;ve added in your code (via `console.log`).\n\n### 3. **Check Logs in the Alexa Developer Console (Simpler Testing)**:\nFor **quick testing** without going into CloudWatch, you can use the **Test** tab in the Alexa Developer Console:\n\n1. **Go to the Alexa Developer Console**:\n   - Open your skill in the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).\n   \n2. **Navigate to the Test Tab**:\n   - Click on the **Test** tab at the top of the screen.\n   - Ensure the **Skill Testing** is set to **Development** (switch on at the top).\n\n3. **Use the Simulator**:\n   - You can type or speak requests directly in the **Alexa Simulator**. Try invoking your skill by typing: `open [your skill name]`.\n   - After you send a request, the **JSON input** and **JSON output** will be displayed below the simulator.\n\n4. **Analyze the Output**:\n   - **Input JSON**: Shows the exact request Alexa sent to your skill.\n   - **Output JSON**: Displays the response that your skill sent back to Alexa.\n\n   If the output is empty or an error occurs, it\u2019s a sign there may be issues in your code.\n\n### 4. **Add Logs to Your Code** (Optional but Helpful):\nTo track issues or check the flow of your skill, you can add `console.log()` statements in your code:\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nconst LaunchRequestHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;LaunchRequest&#x27;;\n    },\n    handle(handlerInput) {\n        console.log(&quot;LaunchRequest triggered&quot;);  // Add this to log the request\n        const speakOutput = &#x27;Welcome! You can ask me any question. What would you like to know?&#x27;;\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(speakOutput)\n            .reprompt(speakOutput)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n- These logs will be visible in **CloudWatch**.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Enable CloudWatch** logs in the Alexa Developer Console.\n- **View Logs**: Use AWS CloudWatch to view detailed logs for your skill.\n- **Test Tab**: Use the Test tab in the Alexa Developer Console for quick testing and to view input/output.\n- **Add Logs**: Use `console.log()` in your code to help track the flow and identify any issues.\n\nLet me know if you need further help with checking your logs or troubleshooting your skill!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

and returning responses to Alexa. Specifically, Alexa is expecting a valid response, but an exception occurred, which caused Alexa to terminate the session and return a **SessionEndedRequest** with the `INVALID_RESPONSE` error.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Reason**: The error log indicates that an &quot;exception occurred while dispatching the request to the skill.&quot;\n- **Root Cause**: This typically happens if there&#x27;s an error in your code, such as:\n  - An issue with the API call (e.g., OpenAI API response).\n  - An error in how the response is being constructed and sent back to Alexa.\n  - A problem with your Lambda function or a timeout.\n\n### Steps to Fix:\n\n#### 1. **Add Detailed Logging to Debug the Error**\nTo pinpoint the exact issue, you should add more logging in your handlers, especially around the areas where exceptions might occur, such as your API call or response building.\n\nUpdate your `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const { intent } = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request;\n\n        // Log the received intent and slots\n        console.log(&#x27;Received Intent:&#x27;, intent);\n\n        // Check if the slot is filled\n        if (!intent.slots.query.value) {\n            const speakOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;What is quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n            console.log(&#x27;Slot value is empty.&#x27;);\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .reprompt(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n\n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            // Log the query being sent to OpenAI\n            console.log(&#x27;Sending query to OpenAI:&#x27;, intent.slots.query.value);\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(intent.slots.query.value);  // Call OpenAI API\n            console.log(&#x27;AI response received:&#x27;, aiResponse);\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(&#x27;Error occurred while calling OpenAI API:&#x27;, error);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing your request.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        // Return the AI response or error message\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThis will log critical parts of the interaction:\n- The **intent** and **slot value** received by Alexa.\n- Whether the OpenAI API call was made successfully.\n- The result of the OpenAI API call.\n- Any error that occurs during the process.\n\n#### 2. **Test the OpenAI API Call**\nEnsure the **OpenAI API call** is functioning correctly. Sometimes an unexpected response from OpenAI (e.g., malformed JSON) can crash your skill.\n\nHere&#x27;s a mock function you can use to test your skill without making real API calls:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getAIResponse(query) {\n    // Simulate a successful AI response for testing\n    return `This is a mock response for your query: ${query}`;\n}\n```\n\nYou can replace your `getAIResponse` function with this mock version temporarily to see if the problem is related to the OpenAI API call.\n\n#### 3. **Check for Timeouts or Lambda Errors**\nIf your skill is running on AWS Lambda, there could be a timeout or other Lambda-specific issues. Verify the following:\n- **Timeout Settings**: Ensure your Lambda function has enough time to complete its execution. You can increase the timeout in the AWS Lambda console.\n- **Lambda Logs**: Check the CloudWatch logs for your Lambda function for any additional error information.\n\n#### 4. **Check for Empty or Invalid Responses**\nMake sure that your skill is always returning a valid response to Alexa. If there is a scenario where no response is sent (or the response is empty), Alexa will return an `INVALID_RESPONSE`.\n\nEnsure you always return something like this:\n```javascript\nreturn handlerInput.responseBuilder\n    .speak(aiResponse)\n    .getResponse();\n```\n\nEven if the OpenAI call fails, you should always return a response with a fallback message to avoid triggering an error.\n\n### 5. **Inspect the Skill Metrics**\nFrom the logs, you can see the `metrics` section which shows the **skillExecutionTimeInMilliseconds**. If this value is very high, it could mean a timeout or slow response from the OpenAI API.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Add more logging** to see where the error occurs.\n- **Mock the OpenAI API** to verify that your skill logic works without the API dependency.\n- **Check for timeouts** and ensure a valid response is always returned to Alexa.\n\nOnce you&#x27;ve added the additional logging and tested it, check the logs in CloudWatch for more detailed insights.

Here&#x27;s a detailed breakdown of how you can use `async` functions, especially when dealing with things like HTTP requests or any asynchronous tasks like calling the OpenAI API.\n\n### Key Concepts of `async` and `await` in JavaScript\n- **`async` functions**: These are functions that return a `Promise`. Using `async` allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, which is more readable.\n- **`await`**: Inside an `async` function, you can use `await` to pause the function execution until a `Promise` is resolved. This is commonly used when making API calls or doing any asynchronous work.\n\n### Steps to Use `async/await` in Your Alexa Skill:\n\n1. **Make the Handler Function `async`**\n   To use `await` inside your intent handler, you must declare the handler as an `async` function. This allows you to wait for the completion of asynchronous operations (like an API call).\n\n   Here&#x27;s an example of how to declare an `async` handler:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n       canHandle(handlerInput) {\n           return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n               &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n       },\n       async handle(handlerInput) {  // Mark the handler function as async\n           const { intent } = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request;\n\n           // Example async operation: Check if the slot is filled\n           if (!intent.slots.query.value) {\n               const speakOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;What is quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n               return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                   .speak(speakOutput)\n                   .reprompt(speakOutput)\n                   .getResponse();\n           }\n\n           let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n           try {\n               // Await the result of an asynchronous API call\n               console.log(&#x27;Sending query to OpenAI:&#x27;, intent.slots.query.value);\n               aiResponse = await getAIResponse(intent.slots.query.value);  // Await the API call result\n               console.log(&#x27;AI response received:&#x27;, aiResponse);\n           } catch (error) {\n               console.log(&#x27;Error occurred while calling OpenAI API:&#x27;, error);\n               aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing your request.&#x27;;\n           }\n\n           // Return the AI response or fallback message\n           return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n               .speak(aiResponse)\n               .getResponse();\n       }\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. **Create an `async` Helper Function**\n   If you&#x27;re making an API call to OpenAI or any external service, that function needs to be asynchronous as well. Here\u2019s how you would structure the API request using `async/await`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const https = require(&#x27;https&#x27;);\n\n   async function getAIResponse(query) {\n       const apiKey = &#x27;your-openai-api-key&#x27;;  // Use your OpenAI API key here\n       const options = {\n           hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n           path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n           method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n           headers: {\n               &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n               &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n           }\n       };\n\n       const body = JSON.stringify({\n           model: &#x27;text-davinci-003&#x27;,  // Replace with your model\n           prompt: query,\n           max_tokens: 100,\n           temperature: 0.7\n       });\n\n       // Use async/await for the API request\n       return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n           const req = https.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n               let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n               res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                   data += chunk;\n               });\n               res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                   console.log(&#x27;Received response from OpenAI:&#x27;, data);\n                   const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                   resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n               });\n           });\n\n           req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, (e) =&gt; {\n               console.log(&#x27;API request error:&#x27;, e);\n               reject(e);\n           });\n\n           req.write(body);\n           req.end();\n       });\n   }\n   ```\n\n   - **`async function getAIResponse`**: This is the function that makes an external API call using Node.js&#x27;s `https` module. It returns a `Promise`, which is why you can use `await` when calling it.\n   - **`await` inside the handler**: When calling `getAIResponse`, use `await` to pause execution until the API response is received.\n\n3. **Deploying and Testing the Skill**\n   Once you&#x27;ve made the changes to the skill (including adding `async` and `await`), you can:\n   - **Save and Deploy** your code in the Alexa Developer Console (in the **Code** section).\n   - Go to the **Test** tab in the Alexa Developer Console and simulate a user request to test the full flow of `async` operations.\n\n   You should see logs and outputs in the console to verify if the API request and responses are working as expected.\n\n### Important Points to Consider:\n- **Error Handling**: Always include `try-catch` blocks around `await` statements to handle any errors that may occur during asynchronous operations (e.g., API failures, timeouts).\n- **Timeouts**: If your external API call takes too long, Alexa might timeout (around 8 seconds is typical), so ensure your API responses are fast or handle timeouts gracefully.\n\n### Example Flow of Asynchronous Handling:\n\n1. The skill receives a user query.\n2. The `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` is triggered and marked `async` to handle asynchronous operations.\n3. Inside the handler, the API request is made asynchronously, and the function waits for the result with `await`.\n4. Once the API response is received, it is used to construct the Alexa response.\n\n### Example Test Query:\nYou can now test it with queries like:\n- &quot;Alexa, ask [your skill name] to tell me about quantum mechanics.&quot;\n- &quot;Alexa, open [your skill name] and ask it what is AI.&quot;\n\nThe responses from the OpenAI API will be awaited, processed, and then sent back to Alexa.\n\nBy using `async` and `await`, you can smoothly handle external API calls in your Alexa skill, making the experience more seamless for users.

This error can occur due to several potential issues, including problems with the OpenAI API request, incorrect response handling, or even misconfigured session handling.\n\n### Key Problem Areas Based on the Error Log:\n\n1. **Skill Endpoint Error (`SKILL_ENDPOINT_ERROR`)**:\n   - The log states that there was an exception during the skill&#x27;s execution, which led to the `INVALID_RESPONSE`. This means that something went wrong with either processing the intent or calling external services like OpenAI.\n   \n2. **OpenAI API Call or Promise Issue**:\n   - If the OpenAI API call is failing, your skill might not be returning a valid response in time, leading to this error. Ensure your API call logic is handling all errors gracefully.\n\n3. **Response Format Issue**:\n   - The response that the skill sends back to Alexa might be incorrectly structured or missing some required data, causing Alexa to terminate the session.\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot:\n\n#### 1. **Check OpenAI API Call and Error Handling:**\nYou need to ensure that any errors during the API request are properly caught and handled, so Alexa can return a response even if the API call fails.\n\nUpdate your `getAIResponse` function to add more detailed logging and ensure proper error handling:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getAIResponse(query) {\n    const apiKey = &#x27;your-openai-api-key&#x27;;  // Replace with your actual OpenAI API key\n    const options = {\n        hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n        path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n        method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    };\n\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        model: &#x27;text-davinci-003&#x27;,  // Adjust if needed for other models\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 100,\n        temperature: 0.7\n    });\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        const req = https.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n            let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n            res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n            res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                try {\n                    const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                    console.log(&#x27;OpenAI response:&#x27;, response);\n                    if (response.choices &amp;&amp; response.choices.length &gt; 0) {\n                        resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n                    } else {\n                        console.log(&#x27;No valid response from OpenAI&#x27;);\n                        resolve(&#x27;Sorry, I couldn\u2019t understand the response.&#x27;);\n                    }\n                } catch (error) {\n                    console.log(&#x27;Error parsing OpenAI response:&#x27;, error);\n                    reject(error);\n                }\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, (e) =&gt; {\n            console.log(&#x27;Error with API request:&#x27;, e);\n            reject(e);\n        });\n\n        req.write(body);\n        req.end();\n    });\n}\n```\n\n- **Additional Logging**: This will log the full response from OpenAI and catch any parsing errors.\n- **Graceful Fallback**: If the API call fails or returns an unexpected response, the skill will return a default fallback message (`Sorry, I couldn\u2019t understand the response.`) instead of crashing.\n\n#### 2. **Handle Empty or Invalid Slot Values**:\nMake sure you\u2019re checking whether the slot is filled properly before making the API call. If the slot is empty, return a prompt asking the user to clarify their input.\n\nYou already have this in place, but verify that it\u2019s working as intended:\n\n```javascript\nif (!intent.slots.query.value) {\n    const speakOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;What is quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n    console.log(&#x27;Slot value is empty.&#x27;);\n    return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n        .speak(speakOutput)\n        .reprompt(speakOutput)\n        .getResponse();\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. **Ensure a Valid Response is Always Returned**:\nAlexa expects a valid response even when an error occurs, so always ensure the response is returned. This is critical because if the skill does not return a response, Alexa will terminate the session with an `INVALID_RESPONSE` error.\n\nIn your `GetAIResponseIntentHandler`, update the response handling to ensure the skill always returns a valid response, even if an error occurs:\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const { intent } = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request;\n\n        // Check if the slot is filled\n        if (!intent.slots.query.value) {\n            const speakOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;What is quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .reprompt(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n\n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            // Call OpenAI API\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(intent.slots.query.value);\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(&#x27;Error occurred while calling OpenAI API:&#x27;, error);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing your request.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        // Return the AI response or fallback message\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### 4. **Check for Timeouts**:\nIf your OpenAI API request takes too long, Alexa may timeout and cause an `INVALID_RESPONSE`. Ensure that your skill is returning responses within Alexa&#x27;s 8-second timeout window.\n\nTo handle timeouts gracefully, consider setting a maximum timeout for your OpenAI API call and returning a default response if the API call takes too long:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getAIResponse(query) {\n    return Promise.race([\n        // Your OpenAI API call\n        makeOpenAIRequest(query),\n        // Timeout after 7 seconds (7000 milliseconds)\n        new Promise((_, reject) =&gt;\n            setTimeout(() =&gt; reject(new Error(&#x27;Timeout&#x27;)), 7000)\n        )\n    ]);\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. **Remove Duplicate Intent Handlers**:\nIt looks like you have **duplicate intent handlers** for `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` in your code. This can cause issues when processing intents.\n\nRemove the redundant `canHandle` and `handle` blocks to keep only one:\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const { intent } = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request;\n\n        // Ensure no delegation\n        handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.dialogState = &#x27;COMPLETED&#x27;;\n\n        if (!intent.slots.query.value) {\n            const speakOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;What is quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .reprompt(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n\n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(intent.slots.query.value);  // Call OpenAI API here\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(`Error with OpenAI API call: ${error}`);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing that.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Remove duplicate intent handlers** to avoid confusion.\n2. **Ensure proper error handling** and return valid fallback responses in case of API failures or timeouts.\n3. **Add logging** to track API responses and errors, and make sure to handle all errors gracefully.\n\nOnce you&#x27;ve made these adjustments, deploy the code again and test the skill using the **Test** tab in the Alexa Developer Console. Check the **CloudWatch logs** for more insights if you encounter further issues.\n\nLet me know if you need additional help!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

"text", "parts": ["It looks like the error you&#x27;re encountering might be related to Alexa using a fallback or default response, instead of your skill handling the request as expected. Specifically, the skill is not returning the expected response, and Alexa is providing a generic &quot;fallback&quot; or pre-generated answer about &quot;the relationship between cops and donuts.&quot; This implies that Alexa is not successfully reaching your OpenAI API integration or handling the custom skill request properly.\n\nHere\u2019s what may be going wrong and how you can address it:\n\n### 1. **Skill Endpoint Error**:\nYour skill might be failing to handle the request properly, causing Alexa to fall back on a default behavior. The log shows an `INVALID_RESPONSE` error, which usually means that the skill endpoint is not returning a valid response within the required time frame or the response format is incorrect.\n\n### 2. **OpenAI API Call Issue**:\nEnsure that your skill is correctly calling the OpenAI API and handling the response or errors from that call. If there\u2019s a delay, timeout, or issue in processing the OpenAI API response, Alexa may resort to using its own fallback.\n\n### 3. **Intent Fulfillment Check**:\nMake sure the `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` is being invoked when the correct intent is triggered, and that it\u2019s handling the request and returning a proper response.\n\n### 4. **Remove Duplicate Intent Handlers**:\nAs noted earlier, you may have multiple copies of the `GetAIResponseIntentHandler`. Ensure that there is only **one handler** for each intent, and it\u2019s correctly implemented.\n\n### 5. **Return Proper Response**:\nYour skill must return a valid response for every request. Even if the OpenAI API call fails or returns an unexpected result, the skill should always return a valid message to Alexa.\n\nHere are specific actions to take:\n\n#### 1. **Log and Verify the Intent Handling**:\n- Make sure to add more logging to check if the correct intent handler is being called. This will help confirm that the skill is reaching the `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` and making the OpenAI API call.\n\nFor example, log the intent and any errors clearly:\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        console.log(&#x27;Checking if GetAIResponseIntentHandler can handle the request&#x27;);\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        console.log(&#x27;GetAIResponseIntentHandler is handling the request&#x27;);\n        const { intent } = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request;\n\n        if (!intent.slots.query.value) {\n            const speakOutput = &quot;I didn&#x27;t catch that. Can you please ask me a question like, &#x27;What is quantum mechanics?&#x27;&quot;;\n            console.log(&#x27;Slot value is empty.&#x27;);\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .reprompt(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n\n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            console.log(&#x27;Sending query to OpenAI:&#x27;, intent.slots.query.value);\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(intent.slots.query.value);\n            console.log(&#x27;Received response from OpenAI:&#x27;, aiResponse);\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(&#x27;Error occurred while calling OpenAI API:&#x27;, error);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing your request.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(aiResponse)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. **Ensure No Duplicate Code**:\nRemove any duplicate `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` definitions. This can lead to confusion and issues during execution.\n\n#### 3. **Check OpenAI API Call**:\nTest the OpenAI API call separately to ensure it\u2019s returning a valid response. If the API call is slow or returning an unexpected error, add timeout handling and make sure the skill gracefully responds if the call fails:\n\n```javascript\n// Ensure OpenAI API call resolves or times out properly\nasync function getAIResponse(query) {\n    return Promise.race([\n        makeOpenAIRequest(query),\n        new Promise((_, reject) =&gt;\n            setTimeout(() =&gt; reject(new Error(&#x27;Timeout&#x27;)), 7000)  // Timeout after 7 seconds\n        )\n    ]);\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. **Check Skill JSON Response**:\nEnsure the JSON response returned by your skill is valid and conforms to Alexa\u2019s expected response structure.\n\n#### 5. **Handle APL (Alexa Presentation Language)**:\nThe logs show some references to APL (visual responses), which suggests your device supports APL but your skill might not be properly handling it. You can either handle APL content by returning APL documents, or ensure your skill works even without APL content.\n\n### Key Debugging Steps:\n- Add more logging to verify where the request is breaking.\n- Check that your `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` is correctly being triggered and completing successfully.\n- Test your OpenAI API call separately to confirm it\u2019s functioning correctly.\n\n### Final Thought:\nIt looks like the skill is defaulting to Alexa\u2019s built-in responses because the skill\u2019s custom logic (especially around the API call) isn\u2019t returning a valid response. Once you ensure your `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` is fully functional and returning a response, the skill should behave as expected."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This helps in debugging.\n2. **Slot Checking**: It checks whether the `query` slot exists and has a value. If not, it returns a fallback response.\n3. **Error Handling**: If the OpenAI API call fails for any reason, the user is informed with a friendly error message.\n4. **Response Handling**: It returns a response using Alexa\u2019s `responseBuilder`.\n\nYou can now replace the existing `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` in your code with this version. This should handle the OpenAI API call and process the user&#x27;s query effectively."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This could happen for a few reasons, including delays in calling the OpenAI API or other issues related to processing time. Here are a few things you can do to address this:\n\n### 1. **Increase the Timeout for Lambda (if you&#x27;re using Lambda)**\nBy default, AWS Lambda functions have a timeout of 3 seconds, but you can extend this up to 15 minutes. You can increase the timeout in the AWS Lambda console:\n- Navigate to the Lambda function for your Alexa skill.\n- Under the **General Configuration** section, increase the **timeout** value to something higher, like 10 seconds, to give your OpenAI API call time to complete.\n\n### 2. **Ensure Efficient API Calls**\nMake sure your API call is optimized to respond quickly. A couple of things you can do:\n- **Reduce the `max_tokens`** in your OpenAI request to minimize the time it takes to process the response. For example, change `max_tokens: 100` to something like `max_tokens: 50`.\n- **Use a faster OpenAI model** if possible (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo` is faster than `text-davinci-003`).\n\n### 3. **Add a Fallback Timeout for API Calls**\nImplement a timeout in your OpenAI API call logic, so that if the API doesn&#x27;t respond within a certain time, your function will gracefully handle the situation. Here&#x27;s an example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction getAIResponse(query) {\n    const apiKey = &#x27;YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY&#x27;;\n    const options = {\n        hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n        path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n        method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    };\n\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        model: &#x27;gpt-3.5-turbo&#x27;,\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 50,  // Reduce token size for faster response\n        temperature: 0.7\n    });\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        const req = https.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n            let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n            res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n            res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, (e) =&gt; {\n            reject(e);\n        });\n\n        // Set a timeout for the API request (in milliseconds)\n        req.setTimeout(5000, () =&gt; {\n            req.abort();  // Abort the request if it takes longer than 5 seconds\n            reject(new Error(&#x27;Request timeout&#x27;));\n        });\n\n        req.write(body);\n        req.end();\n    });\n}\n```\n\nThis way, if the API request takes longer than 5 seconds, it will abort and handle the situation without timing out.\n\n### 4. **Pre-process Long Operations**\nIf you anticipate a long processing time (like analyzing a lengthy query), you could implement a &quot;processing&quot; response. For example, Alexa could say, &quot;Let me think about that,&quot; and then respond with the actual result once it is available.\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const query = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n        \n        let speakOutput = &#x27;Let me think about that for a moment.&#x27;;\n        \n        // Give Alexa a brief response before calling the API\n        handlerInput.responseBuilder.speak(speakOutput).getResponse();\n\n        try {\n            const aiResponse = await getAIResponse(query);\n            speakOutput = aiResponse;\n        } catch (error) {\n            speakOutput = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble getting an answer.&#x27;;\n            console.log(&#x27;Error:&#x27;, error);\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder.speak(speakOutput).getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThis will give the user an immediate response while the skill fetches the OpenAI API result in the background.\n\n### 5. **Optimize DialogState Flow**\nYou can simplify your interaction by checking the `dialogState` and ensuring that the dialog is managed efficiently, especially for long-running queries. If Alexa is struggling with slot values, you can use dialog management to handle these cases.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy increasing the Lambda timeout, optimizing API requests, and implementing a timeout for API calls, you can mitigate the timing issues. These changes should help reduce skill timeout and enhance responsiveness. Let me know if you need further clarification!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, Alexa Skills must return a response within a few seconds (the maximum response window is 8 seconds). To deal with long processing times, you can simulate a &quot;waiting&quot; period or break up the interaction into multiple stages using session attributes.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy for handling long processing times while ensuring a smooth user experience:\n\n1. **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Give the user a message like \u201cLet me think about that for a moment.\u201d\n2. **Session Management**: Store the query in session attributes, then end the current session. When the OpenAI response is ready, the user can request the result again by invoking the skill.\n3. **Progress Check Mechanism**: Create a new intent where the user asks Alexa for the result after some time.\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n#### 1. Update the **`GetAIResponseIntentHandler`** to handle long processing times\n\nThis will provide an immediate response, store the query in the session, and instruct the user to come back for the result.\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    handle(handlerInput) {\n        const query = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n        \n        // Store the query in session attributes so we can use it later\n        const sessionAttributes = handlerInput.attributesManager.getSessionAttributes();\n        sessionAttributes.query = query;\n        handlerInput.attributesManager.setSessionAttributes(sessionAttributes);\n\n        // Respond to the user that Alexa is thinking\n        const speakOutput = &#x27;Let me think about that for a moment. I\u2019ll have an answer for you soon. You can ask me for the result shortly.&#x27;;\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(speakOutput)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### 2. Add a new **`GetResultIntentHandler`** to retrieve the processed response later\n\nThis handler will be invoked by the user after waiting for a while (you can instruct them to say &quot;Alexa, what\u2019s the result?&quot; or something similar). It will check if the result from the OpenAI API is ready and provide it.\n\n```javascript\nconst GetResultIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetResultIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const sessionAttributes = handlerInput.attributesManager.getSessionAttributes();\n        const query = sessionAttributes.query;\n\n        // If no query was previously set, inform the user\n        if (!query) {\n            const speakOutput = &quot;I don\u2019t have anything to look up. You can ask me something first.&quot;;\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n\n        let aiResponse = &#x27;&#x27;;\n        try {\n            aiResponse = await getAIResponse(query);  // Call OpenAI API\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.log(&#x27;Error occurred:&#x27;, error);\n            aiResponse = &#x27;Sorry, I had trouble processing your request.&#x27;;\n        }\n\n        // Return the AI response or error message\n        const speakOutput = aiResponse ? aiResponse : &quot;I&#x27;m still thinking. Please check back later.&quot;;\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(speakOutput)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n#### 3. Example Alexa Interaction Model\n\nYou need to create a new intent in your interaction model called `GetResultIntent`. Here\u2019s a simple intent for the &quot;GetResultIntent&quot; to handle users asking for the response:\n\n```json\n{\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;GetResultIntent&quot;,\n    &quot;slots&quot;: [],\n    &quot;samples&quot;: [\n        &quot;What is the result?&quot;,\n        &quot;Do you have the answer?&quot;,\n        &quot;What\u2019s the result of my question?&quot;,\n        &quot;Do you have the response?&quot;,\n        &quot;Give me the answer.&quot;\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Manage the OpenAI API Call\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of the `getAIResponse` function that gets called when the user asks for the result later:\n\n```javascript\nfunction getAIResponse(query) {\n    const apiKey = &#x27;YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY&#x27;;\n    const options = {\n        hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n        path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n        method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    };\n\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        model: &#x27;gpt-3.5-turbo&#x27;,\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 50,  // Adjust tokens to limit processing time\n        temperature: 0.7\n    });\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        const req = https.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n            let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n            res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n            res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                try {\n                    const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                    resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n                } catch (e) {\n                    reject(new Error(&#x27;Failed to parse response from OpenAI&#x27;));\n                }\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, (e) =&gt; {\n            reject(e);\n        });\n\n        req.write(body);\n        req.end();\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add Handlers to the Skill Builder\n\nFinally, make sure to add the new `GetResultIntentHandler` to the skill builder:\n\n```javascript\nexports.handler = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom()\n    .addRequestHandlers(\n        LaunchRequestHandler,\n        GetAIResponseIntentHandler,  // Add this handler\n        GetResultIntentHandler,      // Add this handler\n        HelloWorldIntentHandler,\n        HelpIntentHandler,\n        CancelAndStopIntentHandler,\n        FallbackIntentHandler,\n        SessionEndedRequestHandler,\n        IntentReflectorHandler)\n    .addErrorHandlers(\n        ErrorHandler)\n    .lambda();\n```\n\n### Final Interaction Flow\n\n1. **User Query (GetAIResponseIntent)**: The user asks a question like &quot;What\u2019s the intersection between cops and donuts?&quot;\n   - Alexa responds with something like &quot;Let me think about that for a moment. I\u2019ll have an answer for you soon.&quot;\n\n2. **Processing**: The session ends, and the backend processes the OpenAI API request in the background.\n\n3. **User Requests Result (GetResultIntent)**: After a while, the user asks, &quot;Do you have the result?&quot; or something similar.\n   - Alexa responds with the OpenAI-generated response (or tells the user to wait longer if the response isn\u2019t ready).\n\nThis approach will ensure that Alexa responds quickly, while giving the backend time to process more complex requests."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, here&#x27;s a refined approach that keeps the interaction smooth without forcing the user to ask again but also handles long processing time within Alexa&#x27;s constraints.\n\n### Approach: **Async Background Processing with Progress Updates**\n\nWe will handle this by giving an initial response to the user to acknowledge the request and inform them that processing is ongoing. Then, Alexa keeps trying to fetch the result from OpenAI in the background until a result is available, all within the same session.\n\nSince the session timeout for Alexa is approximately 8 seconds, you need to manage the processing within that limit or provide a conversational progress update, so it appears as though Alexa is still thinking.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the Request**: Provide a quick acknowledgment to the user that the request has been received and that Alexa is processing it.\n\n2. **Progress Updates**: Use `reprompt()` to extend the session and simulate waiting. This way, you can give the user progress updates or inform them that more time is needed.\n\n3. **Final Response**: Once OpenAI&#x27;s response is ready (within the session), Alexa will deliver the result.\n\n### Updated `GetAIResponseIntentHandler` Example:\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const query = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n        \n        // Respond to the user that Alexa is thinking\n        let speakOutput = &quot;Let me think about that for a moment.&quot;;\n\n        try {\n            // Send the query to OpenAI\n            const aiResponse = await getAIResponse(query);\n\n            // If the response arrives in time, Alexa provides the final response\n            speakOutput = `Here is what I found: ${aiResponse}`;\n        } catch (error) {\n            // If there&#x27;s an error or time out, inform the user\n            console.log(&#x27;Error occurred while calling OpenAI API:&#x27;, error);\n            speakOutput = &quot;Sorry, I had trouble processing your request.&quot;;\n        }\n\n        return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(speakOutput)\n            .getResponse();\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Progressive Update Using Reprompt (if longer processing is needed):\n\nYou can manage longer tasks with periodic responses from Alexa to simulate waiting (though this has limitations within Alexa&#x27;s timeout).\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const query = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n        \n        // Initial response to acknowledge\n        let speakOutput = &quot;Let me think about that for a moment.&quot;;\n\n        // Provide a reprompt to simulate waiting\n        let repromptOutput = &quot;Still working on it...&quot;;\n\n        // Build a response to give a progress update\n        const responseBuilder = handlerInput.responseBuilder.speak(speakOutput).reprompt(repromptOutput);\n\n        // Attempt to get the AI response\n        try {\n            // Here, we&#x27;re simulating a slightly longer process by waiting a couple of seconds\n            const aiResponse = await getAIResponse(query);\n            \n            // If we have the response in time, update the response and clear the reprompt\n            speakOutput = `Here is what I found: ${aiResponse}`;\n            return responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse(); // Final response\n        } catch (error) {\n            // If there&#x27;s an error or time out, inform the user\n            console.log(&#x27;Error occurred while calling OpenAI API:&#x27;, error);\n            speakOutput = &quot;Sorry, I had trouble processing your request.&quot;;\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(speakOutput)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Handling the OpenAI Response (`getAIResponse` Function)\n\nMake sure that your `getAIResponse` function handles API calls efficiently and provides error handling for longer requests:\n\n```javascript\nfunction getAIResponse(query) {\n    const apiKey = &#x27;YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY&#x27;;\n    const options = {\n        hostname: &#x27;api.openai.com&#x27;,\n        path: &#x27;/v1/completions&#x27;,\n        method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    };\n\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        model: &#x27;gpt-3.5-turbo&#x27;,\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 50,  // Adjust this for longer responses\n        temperature: 0.7\n    });\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        const req = https.request(options, (res) =&gt; {\n            let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n            res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n            res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                try {\n                    const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                    resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n                } catch (e) {\n                    reject(new Error(&#x27;Failed to parse response from OpenAI&#x27;));\n                }\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, (e) =&gt; {\n            reject(e);\n        });\n\n        req.write(body);\n        req.end();\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Max Timeout**: You can\u2019t hold the user session for too long in Alexa, so ensure that your requests to OpenAI return within a few seconds. If you expect the request to take longer, you may need to break up the interaction into multiple sessions (though this goes against your preference for a single request).\n\n- **Filling Time with Reprompt**: Alexa&#x27;s reprompt mechanism is crucial for extending sessions. Use reprompt effectively to simulate thinking or progress, but keep in mind there\u2019s still a hard time limit (~8 seconds) to finish the conversation.\n\nThis approach ensures that the user can give their prompt once, and Alexa will either provide a quick response or handle a slightly longer task gracefully within its session constraints."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

error code `SKILL_ENDPOINT_ERROR`. This usually indicates that the Lambda function used by Alexa is not returning a valid response, or there was an issue in handling the request within the defined time limit. Here&#x27;s what we can do to address this issue:\n\n### Key Issues:\n1. **Timeout or Long Execution**: Alexa may be timing out because of a long OpenAI API request.\n2. **Lambda Error**: If the Lambda function encounters an error, it might not return the correct response.\n\n### Solution: Breaking Down the Problem\n\n1. **Return an Immediate Response from Alexa**: Alexa needs to respond quickly to user requests. We will return an initial &quot;processing&quot; message to the user while handling the longer API call in the background.\n\n2. **Using Async Await Properly**: Ensure that the OpenAI API call is handled asynchronously and properly awaited.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Add better error handling to prevent any unhandled exceptions from breaking the skill.\n\n### Steps to Address the Timeout\n\n1. **Initial Response**: Return a quick acknowledgment that the skill is working on the request, so Alexa doesn\u2019t timeout while waiting for a longer response.\n\n2. **Async Processing**: You can process the OpenAI request in the background, but you\u2019ll need to inform the user that it\u2019s &quot;thinking&quot; and manage the skill&#x27;s conversation appropriately.\n\n### Updated Code with Proper Async Handling and Initial Response\n\n```javascript\nconst GetAIResponseIntentHandler = {\n    canHandle(handlerInput) {\n        return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n            &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n    },\n    async handle(handlerInput) {\n        const query = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n\n        // Provide a quick response first to acknowledge the request\n        const speakOutput = &quot;Let me think about that for a moment.&quot;;\n        const responseBuilder = handlerInput.responseBuilder\n            .speak(speakOutput)\n            .getResponse();\n\n        // Perform async operation: OpenAI API call\n        try {\n            const aiResponse = await getAIResponse(query);\n\n            // Log the AI response for debugging\n            console.log(&quot;AI Response: &quot;, aiResponse);\n\n            // Now return the final response to the user, either via APL or speech\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(`Here is what I found: ${aiResponse}`)\n                .getResponse();\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.error(&quot;Error fetching AI response: &quot;, error);\n\n            // In case of error, respond with a generic error message\n            return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n                .speak(&quot;Sorry, I encountered an error processing your request.&quot;)\n                .getResponse();\n        }\n\n        // Return the initial &quot;thinking&quot; response while async processing continues\n        return responseBuilder;\n    }\n};\n\n// Example of OpenAI API call function\nasync function getAIResponse(query) {\n    const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;\n    const url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/completions&quot;;\n\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        model: &quot;text-davinci-003&quot;,\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 100,\n        temperature: 0.7\n    });\n\n    const headers = {\n        &quot;Authorization&quot;: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,\n        &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;\n    };\n\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        const req = https.request(url, { method: &#x27;POST&#x27;, headers }, (res) =&gt; {\n            let data = &#x27;&#x27;;\n            res.on(&#x27;data&#x27;, (chunk) =&gt; {\n                data += chunk;\n            });\n            res.on(&#x27;end&#x27;, () =&gt; {\n                try {\n                    const response = JSON.parse(data);\n                    resolve(response.choices[0].text.trim());\n                } catch (error) {\n                    reject(error);\n                }\n            });\n        });\n\n        req.on(&#x27;error&#x27;, reject);\n        req.write(body);\n        req.end();\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initial Response**: Alexa will immediately tell the user, &quot;Let me think about that for a moment,&quot; allowing us to avoid timeouts while waiting for the OpenAI response.\n\n2. **Async OpenAI Request**: The OpenAI API call is handled asynchronously. If the response is received quickly enough, Alexa will update the user with the final response. If it takes too long, Alexa will return the initial message.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Errors (such as timeouts or parsing errors) are caught and logged, and the user is informed of any issues with a fallback error message.\n\n### Notes:\n- **Timeout Considerations**: Alexa skills typically have a 8-second timeout for responses. If the OpenAI response consistently takes longer than this, you may want to handle that by telling the user to try again later or using an external system (e.g., sending the result to their Alexa app).\n- **Progress Updates**: Alexa can\u2019t handle asynchronous background processes effectively, so it&#x27;s best to ensure your API calls are fast or provide progress updates to simulate the delay.\n\nBy handling this flow asynchronously, you&#x27;ll reduce timeouts and provide better error messaging when things go wrong."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide to help you locate the logs for your Lambda function:\n\n### Step 1: Ensure CloudWatch Logs are Enabled\nLambda functions automatically generate CloudWatch logs, but you need to ensure that the right permissions are in place. Check if your Lambda function has the necessary permissions by following these steps:\n\n1. **Go to AWS Lambda Console:**\n   - Visit [AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home).\n   - Select your function from the list (this will be the function linked to your Alexa skill).\n\n2. **Check IAM Role Permissions:**\n   - Go to the **Configuration** tab for your Lambda function.\n   - Under **Execution role**, click the role name to open the IAM role in a new tab.\n   - Check if the role has the **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole** policy attached. This policy grants permission to write logs to CloudWatch.\n   \n   If the policy isn\u2019t attached, you can add it:\n   - Click **Add permissions** &gt; **Attach policies**.\n   - Search for **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole** and attach it.\n\n### Step 2: Go to CloudWatch Logs\nOnce you&#x27;re sure that logging is enabled, follow these steps to access the logs:\n\n1. **Go to CloudWatch Console:**\n   - Visit [AWS CloudWatch Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home).\n\n2. **Access Log Groups:**\n   - In the left-hand menu, click on **Logs** &gt; **Log groups**.\n   - Look for a log group with the name format `/aws/lambda/&lt;lambda-function-name&gt;`. This log group contains all logs generated by your Lambda function.\n   - If you\u2019re not sure about the function name, it should be the same as the Lambda function linked to your Alexa skill.\n\n3. **View Log Streams:**\n   - Click on the log group for your Lambda function.\n   - You&#x27;ll see a list of log streams. These are individual logs for each invocation of your Lambda function. The most recent log streams are at the top.\n   - Click on a log stream to view the details of each execution, including error messages, console logs, and stack traces.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Logs\nOnce you have opened a log stream:\n- Look for any lines marked as **ERROR** or containing stack traces.\n- You&#x27;ll also see the input and output of the Lambda function calls, which can help you understand where things might be going wrong.\n- If OpenAI API errors are occurring, they should be logged here.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Use Filters**: You can filter your logs to look for specific errors. Use the search box in the log stream view to look for terms like `ERROR`, `RequestId`, or other relevant keywords.\n- **Increase Logging**: If necessary, you can add more detailed logging in your Lambda function using `console.log()` to trace the execution path.\n\nWould you like me to help with writing additional logging code in your Lambda function to better understand where the error is occurring?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true
