The Best ClickBank Affiliate Offers Hide in the Dietary Supplements Category\n\nIt is no surprise that the best ClickBank offers are in the dietary supplements category.\u00a0\n\nLooking \u30109\u2020at their numbers\u2020www.clickbank.com\u3011, you\u2019ll see all the usual suspects, some of which have been top-performing for months and years:\n\n  * \u301010\u2020Exipure\u2020exipure.com\u3011 (EPC (average earnings per click): $0.93; average ClickBank payout (APV): $152.62)\n  * \u301011\u2020Protetox\u2020protetox.com\u3011 (EPC: $2.06; APV: $141.15)\n\n[Image 3][Image 4]\n\n### The Best Way to Promote Dietary Supplements as a ClickBank Affiliate\n\nWhile ClickBank shows the products\u2019 EPC and APV, you will need to do your own legwork to sell the products. When it comes to dietary supplements, we\u2019ve found that Facebook Ads and Google Display Ads work best.\n\nHowever, some affiliates swear by YouTube ads \u2013 especially for products with comprehensive affiliate programs like Protetox. The brand frequently launches special promotions, allowing you to earn even more.\n\nNo matter the advertising channel you choose, make sure you \u301012\u2020set up your ClickBank tracking via RedTrack\u2020docs.redtrack.io\u3011, so you fine-tune your marketing strategy.\n\n## 2. Help Your Audience Stay Fit with Fitness ClickBank Offers for Affiliates while Tracking Upsells\n\nIf your audience loves improving their physical health, they will love some of the products on ClickBank\u2019s marketplace. In particular, ClickBank affiliates love the following two health &amp; fitness offers:\n\n  * \u301013\u2020Yogaburn\u2020yogaburnchallenge.com\u3011 (Avg commission: $14/sale)\n  * \u301014\u2020Venus Factor System\u2020venusfactor.org\u3011 (Avg commission: up to 75%/sale)\n\n[Image 5][Image 6]\n\n### How to Promote Weight Loss &amp; Fitness Products as a ClickBank Affiliate\n\nFitness products have a vast upsell potential (especially comprehensive programs like Yogaburn).\u00a0\n\nAll you have to do is ensure your audience stays engaged even after the first purchase. Create a retention (or perhaps even referral) program, set up email sequences, and produce helpful content.\n\nSince you\u2019ll want to know about every single conversion and upsell, it\u2019s a ClickBank affiliate best practice to enable conversion tracking.\u00a0Data slips through the cracks with typical (ad) tracking. We recommend \u301015\u2020using S2S (server-side) conversion tracking\u3011 so you get accurate payouts and know which channels work best for your ClickBank offers.\n\n[Image 7: reporting for ad agencies][Image 8: reporting for ad agencies]\n\nKnow exactly which channel is over- and under-performing. Then, double down on what works!\n\n## 3. Find a Professional ClickBank Offer like Midas Manifestation (and Make Your Work 50x Easier)\n\nSelf-help is all the rage these days, so it\u2019s no surprise that \u301016\u2020Midas Manifestation\u2020midasmanifestation.com\u3011 is one of the highest-converting ClickBank offers.\n\nIf it\u2019s a good fit for your audience, it\u2019s worth checking out for the $3 EPC, up to 90% commission, and credit for upsells and follow-up sales.\u00a0\n\nPlus, you can promote the Midas Manifestation product as an affiliate even on Facebook Ads.\u00a0\n\n[Image 9][Image 10]\n\n### ClickBank Affiliate Best Practice: Look for Affiliate Offer Professionalism\n\nOnly some ClickBank products have well-structured affiliate programs. Others may waste your time because you\u2019ll have to spend your resources to promote them.\n\nIn contrast, products like Midas Manifestation show clear signs of a professional affiliate offer:\n\n  * You get an email swipe file with well-performing email templates.\n  * They offer a Facebook Ad kit and plenty of banners.\n  * Need help? They have a support team that you can contact.\n\nSince products like Midas Manifestation support different channels, ensure your \u301017\u2020multi-platform ad tracking\u3011 is solid.\n\n[Image 11][Image 12]\n\nDon\u2019t waste your budget on ineffective channels and campaigns; identify the best approach with an affiliate-friendly marketing attribution tool like \u301018\u2020RedTrack\u3011.\n\n## 4.

The DIY and woodworking niches are constantly growing, but don\u2019t let existing customers slip away.\u00a0\n\nMeasure your success. For example, evaluate how well your existing affiliate customers respond to specific channels. Do they prefer organic content? Google Ads retargeting?

The Best ClickBank Affiliate Offers Hide in the Dietary Supplements Category\n\nIt is no surprise that the best ClickBank offers are in the dietary supplements category.\u00a0\n\nLooking \u30109\u2020at their numbers\u2020www.clickbank.com\u3011, you\u2019ll see all the usual suspects, some of which have been top-performing for months and years:\n\n  * \u301010\u2020Exipure\u2020exipure.com\u3011 (EPC (average earnings per click): $0.93; average ClickBank payout (APV): $152.62)\n  * \u301011\u2020Protetox\u2020protetox.com\u3011 (EPC: $2.06; APV: $141.15)\n\n[Image 3][Image 4]\n\n### The Best Way to Promote Dietary Supplements as a ClickBank Affiliate\n\nWhile ClickBank shows the products\u2019 EPC and APV, you will need to do your own legwork to sell the products. When it comes to dietary supplements, we\u2019ve found that Facebook Ads and Google Display Ads work best.\n\nHowever, some affiliates swear by YouTube ads \u2013 especially for products with comprehensive affiliate programs like Protetox. The brand frequently launches special promotions, allowing you to earn even more.\n\nNo matter the advertising channel you choose, make sure you \u301012\u2020set up your ClickBank tracking via RedTrack\u2020docs.redtrack.io\u3011, so you fine-tune your marketing strategy.\n\n## 2. Help Your Audience Stay Fit with Fitness ClickBank Offers for Affiliates while Tracking Upsells\n\nIf your audience loves improving their physical health, they will love some of the products on ClickBank\u2019s marketplace. In particular, ClickBank affiliates love the following two health &amp; fitness offers:\n\n  * \u301013\u2020Yogaburn\u2020yogaburnchallenge.com\u3011 (Avg commission: $14/sale)\n  * \u301014\u2020Venus Factor System\u2020venusfactor.org\u3011 (Avg commission: up to 75%/sale)\n\n[Image 5][Image 6]\n\n### How to Promote Weight Loss &amp; Fitness Products as a ClickBank Affiliate\n\nFitness products have a vast upsell potential (especially comprehensive programs like Yogaburn).\u00a0\n\nAll you have to do is ensure your audience stays engaged even after the first purchase. Create a retention (or perhaps even referral) program, set up email sequences, and produce helpful content.\n\nSince you\u2019ll want to know about every single conversion and upsell, it\u2019s a ClickBank affiliate best practice to enable conversion tracking.\u00a0Data slips through the cracks with typical (ad) tracking. We recommend \u301015\u2020using S2S (server-side) conversion tracking\u3011 so you get accurate payouts and know which channels work best for your ClickBank offers.\n\n[Image 7: reporting for ad agencies][Image 8: reporting for ad agencies]\n\nKnow exactly which channel is over- and under-performing. Then, double down on what works!\n\n## 3. Find a Professional ClickBank Offer like Midas Manifestation (and Make Your Work 50x Easier)\n\nSelf-help is all the rage these days, so it\u2019s no surprise that \u301016\u2020Midas Manifestation\u2020midasmanifestation.com\u3011 is one of the highest-converting ClickBank offers.\n\nIf it\u2019s a good fit for your audience, it\u2019s worth checking out for the $3 EPC, up to 90% commission, and credit for upsells and follow-up sales.\u00a0\n\nPlus, you can promote the Midas Manifestation product as an affiliate even on Facebook Ads.\u00a0\n\n[Image 9][Image 10]\n\n### ClickBank Affiliate Best Practice: Look for Affiliate Offer Professionalism\n\nOnly some ClickBank products have well-structured affiliate programs. Others may waste your time because you\u2019ll have to spend your resources to promote them.\n\nIn contrast, products like Midas Manifestation show clear signs of a professional affiliate offer:\n\n  * You get an email swipe file with well-performing email templates.\n  * They offer a Facebook Ad kit and plenty of banners.\n  * Need help? They have a support team that you can contact.\n\nSince products like Midas Manifestation support different channels, ensure your \u301017\u2020multi-platform ad tracking\u3011 is solid.\n\n[Image 11][Image 12]\n\nDon\u2019t waste your budget on ineffective channels and campaigns; identify the best approach with an affiliate-friendly marketing attribution tool like \u301018\u2020RedTrack\u3011.\n\n## 4. Are There Profitable Affiliate ClickBank Offers for Hobby Products? You Bet!\n\nAnd \u301019\u2020Ted\u2019s Woodworking\u2020www.tedswoodworking.com\u3011 is one of them! If your audience loves DIY-ing or woodworking, they\u2019ll love the library of constantly updated woodworking plans.\n\n(As an affiliate, you\u2019ll love the upsell potential. ;))\n\nTed\u2019s Woodworking program typically sees 10% conversions on cold and 23% on warm traffic, with upsell opportunities and membership offers you can use to generate more revenue.\n\n[Image 13][Image 14]\n\n### Best Practices for Promoting ClickBank Affiliate Products in the Hobby Niche\n\nThe riches are definitely in the niches and when promoting a hobby product, choose yours wisely.\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to hop on Reddit or other forums to understand how your audience thinks and behaves, so you can profitably position your hobby ClickBank product.\n\nKeep your audience engaged. The DIY and woodworking niches are constantly growing, but don\u2019t let existing customers slip away.\u00a0\n\nMeasure your success. For example, evaluate how well your existing affiliate customers respond to specific channels. Do they prefer organic content? Google Ads retargeting? TikTok?\n\nTest, mix &amp; match, and don\u2019t forget to \u301020\u2020track\u3011!\n\n## 5. What Is the Best ClickBank Infoproduct Offer (and How Can You Promote It)?\n\nIf your audience loves their furry friends, check out \u301021\u2020Doggy Dan\u2019s Online Dog Trainer\u2020affiliates.theonlinedogtrainer.com\u3011.\n\n[Image 15][Image 16]\n\nIt consistently ranks well for commissions, conversions, and other ClickBank metrics, so it\u2019s worth exploring. Just make sure you\u2026\n\n### Best Practices for ClickBank Affiliate Marketing\n\nWhen it comes to info products, you need great content.

Vincent, having applied these revelations to his own life, experienced unprecedented prosperity in every facet. \n\nRather than hoarding this priceless knowledge, he chose to make it accessible to all, enabling everyone to thrive, find happiness, and lead a stress-free existence. \n\nAll these invaluable insights from the Akashic records are meticulously curated in the Midas Manifestation handbook. To complement this, you&#x27;ll also receive accompanying audio tracks and a handy quick start guide. \n\n [Image 2: Midas Manifestation Author] \n\n## Midas Manifestation Author\n\nThe very first thing when people select any program, they want to know who is the creator of it.  \n\nThe man behind this wonderful manifestation program is Vincent Smith. He is a cultural researcher and wants people to know the power of manifestation for their success.  \n\nSmith also teaches people how to contact universe authorities to achieve wealth, abundance, and health in life.  \n\nHe further defines that there are many secrets and treasures in this universe, and people must know how to achieve them, and it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are. People must put full attention and devotion to this program to become successful in their life.  \n\n### How Does Midas Manifestation Work?\n\n#### Midas Manifestation was created by ancient decoding drawings, texts, and manuscripts. According to Vincent\u2019s research, he discovered 12 Chakras as opposed to 7, as is commonly known.  \n\nThe other five Chakras he found are very powerful and help people tap into a new dimension in the universe. The chakras connect with the universe and help people achieve more extraordinary things in life. \n\nThe five chakras include: \n\n1) Transcendence &amp; Connection to Spirit \n\n2) Sea of the Soul \n\n3) Earth Connection \n\n4) Mind over\n\n5) Matter \n\n6) Universal Unity\n\nThe five hidden chakras are responsible for making individuals more aware of their thoughts and using the power of the mind to manifest successfully.\n\nVincent first started by testing the chakras using audio sounds, and after a while, he could find the correct frequencies. In Midas Manifestation, you will find soundtracks that use frequencies to activate all 12 chakras. The audio tracks balance the 12 chakras in the body and ensure each one performs its purpose.\n\n[Image 3: midas manifestation-prayer] \n\n[Image 4: midas-manifestation-buy] \n\n\u30100\u2020Buy From Official Website\u20208958ffsh1y-ef-nhr7gdtyxtma.hop.clickbank.net\u3011\n\n### How does Midas Manifestation Help Users?\n\n[Image 5: Midas Manifestation] \n\nThe author aims to teach people the hidden concepts of the world through the novel.

People must put full attention and devotion to this program to become successful in their life.  \n\n### How Does Midas Manifestation Work?\n\n#### Midas Manifestation was created by ancient decoding drawings, texts, and manuscripts. According to Vincent\u2019s research, he discovered 12 Chakras as opposed to 7, as is commonly known.  \n\nThe other five Chakras he found are very powerful and help people tap into a new dimension in the universe. The chakras connect with the universe and help people achieve more extraordinary things in life. \n\nThe five chakras include: \n\n1) Transcendence &amp; Connection to Spirit \n\n2) Sea of the Soul \n\n3) Earth Connection \n\n4) Mind over\n\n5) Matter \n\n6) Universal Unity\n\nThe five hidden chakras are responsible for making individuals more aware of their thoughts and using the power of the mind to manifest successfully.\n\nVincent first started by testing the chakras using audio sounds, and after a while, he could find the correct frequencies. In Midas Manifestation, you will find soundtracks that use frequencies to activate all 12 chakras. The audio tracks balance the 12 chakras in the body and ensure each one performs its purpose.\n\n[Image 3: midas manifestation-prayer] \n\n[Image 4: midas-manifestation-buy] \n\n\u30100\u2020Buy From Official Website\u20208958ffsh1y-ef-nhr7gdtyxtma.hop.clickbank.net\u3011\n\n### How does Midas Manifestation Help Users?\n\n[Image 5: Midas Manifestation] \n\nThe author aims to teach people the hidden concepts of the world through the novel.

The Best ClickBank Affiliate Offers Hide in the Dietary Supplements Category\n\nIt is no surprise that the best ClickBank offers are in the dietary supplements category.\u00a0\n\nLooking \u30109\u2020at their numbers\u2020www.clickbank.com\u3011, you\u2019ll see all the usual suspects, some of which have been top-performing for months and years:\n\n  * \u301010\u2020Exipure\u2020exipure.com\u3011 (EPC (average earnings per click): $0.93; average ClickBank payout (APV): $152.62)\n  * \u301011\u2020Protetox\u2020protetox.com\u3011 (EPC: $2.06; APV: $141.15)\n\n[Image 3][Image 4]\n\n### The Best Way to Promote Dietary Supplements as a ClickBank Affiliate\n\nWhile ClickBank shows the products\u2019 EPC and APV, you will need to do your own legwork to sell the products. When it comes to dietary supplements, we\u2019ve found that Facebook Ads and Google Display Ads work best.\n\nHowever, some affiliates swear by YouTube ads \u2013 especially for products with comprehensive affiliate programs like Protetox. The brand frequently launches special promotions, allowing you to earn even more.\n\nNo matter the advertising channel you choose, make sure you \u301012\u2020set up your ClickBank tracking via RedTrack\u2020docs.redtrack.io\u3011, so you fine-tune your marketing strategy.\n\n## 2. Help Your Audience Stay Fit with Fitness ClickBank Offers for Affiliates while Tracking Upsells\n\nIf your audience loves improving their physical health, they will love some of the products on ClickBank\u2019s marketplace. In particular, ClickBank affiliates love the following two health &amp; fitness offers:\n\n  * \u301013\u2020Yogaburn\u2020yogaburnchallenge.com\u3011 (Avg commission: $14/sale)\n  * \u301014\u2020Venus Factor System\u2020venusfactor.org\u3011 (Avg commission: up to 75%/sale)\n\n[Image 5][Image 6]\n\n### How to Promote Weight Loss &amp; Fitness Products as a ClickBank Affiliate\n\nFitness products have a vast upsell potential (especially comprehensive programs like Yogaburn).\u00a0\n\nAll you have to do is ensure your audience stays engaged even after the first purchase. Create a retention (or perhaps even referral) program, set up email sequences, and produce helpful content.\n\nSince you\u2019ll want to know about every single conversion and upsell, it\u2019s a ClickBank affiliate best practice to enable conversion tracking.\u00a0Data slips through the cracks with typical (ad) tracking. We recommend \u301015\u2020using S2S (server-side) conversion tracking\u3011 so you get accurate payouts and know which channels work best for your ClickBank offers.\n\n[Image 7: reporting for ad agencies][Image 8: reporting for ad agencies]\n\nKnow exactly which channel is over- and under-performing.

Others may waste your time because you\u2019ll have to spend your resources to promote them.\n\nIn contrast, products like Midas Manifestation show clear signs of a professional affiliate offer:\n\n  * You get an email swipe file with well-performing email templates.\n  * They offer a Facebook Ad kit and plenty of banners.\n  * Need help? They have a support team that you can contact.\n\nSince products like Midas Manifestation support different channels, ensure your \u301017\u2020multi-platform ad tracking\u3011 is solid.\n\n[Image 11][Image 12]\n\nDon\u2019t waste your budget on ineffective channels and campaigns; identify the best approach with an affiliate-friendly marketing attribution tool like \u301018\u2020RedTrack\u3011.\n\n## 4.

The DIY and woodworking niches are constantly growing, but don\u2019t let existing customers slip away.\u00a0\n\nMeasure your success.

Vincent, having applied these revelations to his own life, experienced unprecedented prosperity in every facet. \n\nRather than hoarding this priceless knowledge, he chose to make it accessible to all, enabling everyone to thrive, find happiness, and lead a stress-free existence. \n\nAll these invaluable insights from the Akashic records are meticulously curated in the Midas Manifestation handbook. To complement this, you&#x27;ll also receive accompanying audio tracks and a handy quick start guide. \n\n [Image 2: Midas Manifestation Author] \n\n## Midas Manifestation Author\n\nThe very first thing when people select any program, they want to know who is the creator of it.  \n\nThe man behind this wonderful manifestation program is Vincent Smith. He is a cultural researcher and wants people to know the power of manifestation for their success.  \n\nSmith also teaches people how to contact universe authorities to achieve wealth, abundance, and health in life.  \n\nHe further defines that there are many secrets and treasures in this universe, and people must know how to achieve them, and it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are. People must put full attention and devotion to this program to become successful in their life.  \n\n### How Does Midas Manifestation Work?\n\n#### Midas Manifestation was created by ancient decoding drawings, texts, and manuscripts. According to Vincent\u2019s research, he discovered 12 Chakras as opposed to 7, as is commonly known.  \n\nThe other five Chakras he found are very powerful and help people tap into a new dimension in the universe. The chakras connect with the universe and help people achieve more extraordinary things in life. \n\nThe five chakras include: \n\n1) Transcendence &amp; Connection to Spirit \n\n2) Sea of the Soul \n\n3) Earth Connection \n\n4) Mind over\n\n5) Matter \n\n6) Universal Unity\n\nThe five hidden chakras are responsible for making individuals more aware of their thoughts and using the power of the mind to manifest successfully.\n\nVincent first started by testing the chakras using audio sounds, and after a while, he could find the correct frequencies. In Midas Manifestation, you will find soundtracks that use frequencies to activate all 12 chakras. The audio tracks balance the 12 chakras in the body and ensure each one performs its purpose.\n\n[Image 3: midas manifestation-prayer] \n\n[Image 4: midas-manifestation-buy] \n\n\u30100\u2020Buy From Official Website\u20208958ffsh1y-ef-nhr7gdtyxtma.hop.clickbank.net\u3011\n\n### How does Midas Manifestation Help Users?\n\n[Image 5: Midas Manifestation] \n\nThe author aims to teach people the hidden concepts of the world through the novel.

The tracks include:\n\n  * Midas Unleashed:  This focuses on the root chakra to improve the generation of wealth and success of the user.\n  * Manipura Consciousness: This focuses on the solar plexus chakra to improve consciousness and support all chakras. \n  * Manifest Destiny: This focuses on the third eye chakra to connect with an underlying consciousness. \n  * Divine Willingness: This focuses on the crown chakra to introduce more abundance from the universe around them. \n  * Anahata Bliss: This focuses on the heart chakra to reduce the negative thoughts that could inhibit gifts of wealth from the universe.\n\n#### \n\nUsers will receive an e-Book called Midas Manifestation Handbook, which explains everything Vincent learned through his interpretation of the ancient manuscript over 118 pages. In another e-book, users get 128 pages of further information that he\u2019s learned with a known hypnotist.\n\n[Image 6: midas manifestation-book] \n\n##  Midas Manifestation System is the first online program that has introduced the spiritual concept into the manifestation to help people manifest more money, financial freedom, a prosperous career, a loving relationship, and happy life.   \n\n* * *\n\n### Total Value: ~~$133/~~\n\nOnly for: $37/ Limited Time  \nHURRY UP! \n\n\u30100\u2020Buy From Official Website\u20208958ffsh1y-ef-nhr7gdtyxtma.hop.clickbank.net\u3011\n\n[Image 7: the Devotion System Limited Stock Warning]\n\nLIMITED TIME OFFER:  Click To Check If You\u2019re Eligible For Our Midas Manifestation Exclusive Discount.

The Best ClickBank Affiliate Offers Hide in the Dietary Supplements Category\n\nIt is no surprise that the best ClickBank offers are in the dietary supplements category.\u00a0\n\nLooking \u30109\u2020at their numbers\u2020www.clickbank.com\u3011, you\u2019ll see all the usual suspects, some of which have been top-performing for months and years:\n\n  * \u301010\u2020Exipure\u2020exipure.com\u3011 (EPC (average earnings per click): $0.93; average ClickBank payout (APV): $152.62)\n  * \u301011\u2020Protetox\u2020protetox.com\u3011 (EPC: $2.06; APV: $141.15)\n\n[Image 3][Image 4]\n\n### The Best Way to Promote Dietary Supplements as a ClickBank Affiliate\n\nWhile ClickBank shows the products\u2019 EPC and APV, you will need to do your own legwork to sell the products. When it comes to dietary supplements, we\u2019ve found that Facebook Ads and Google Display Ads work best.\n\nHowever, some affiliates swear by YouTube ads \u2013 especially for products with comprehensive affiliate programs like Protetox. The brand frequently launches special promotions, allowing you to earn even more.\n\nNo matter the advertising channel you choose, make sure you \u301012\u2020set up your ClickBank tracking via RedTrack\u2020docs.redtrack.io\u3011, so you fine-tune your marketing strategy.\n\n## 2. Help Your Audience Stay Fit with Fitness ClickBank Offers for Affiliates while Tracking Upsells\n\nIf your audience loves improving their physical health, they will love some of the products on ClickBank\u2019s marketplace. In particular, ClickBank affiliates love the following two health &amp; fitness offers:\n\n  * \u301013\u2020Yogaburn\u2020yogaburnchallenge.com\u3011 (Avg commission: $14/sale)\n  * \u301014\u2020Venus Factor System\u2020venusfactor.org\u3011 (Avg commission: up to 75%/sale)\n\n[Image 5][Image 6]\n\n### How to Promote Weight Loss &amp; Fitness Products as a ClickBank Affiliate\n\nFitness products have a vast upsell potential (especially comprehensive programs like Yogaburn).\u00a0\n\nAll you have to do is ensure your audience stays engaged even after the first purchase. Create a retention (or perhaps even referral) program, set up email sequences, and produce helpful content.\n\nSince you\u2019ll want to know about every single conversion and upsell, it\u2019s a ClickBank affiliate best practice to enable conversion tracking.\u00a0Data slips through the cracks with typical (ad) tracking. We recommend \u301015\u2020using S2S (server-side) conversion tracking\u3011 so you get accurate payouts and know which channels work best for your ClickBank offers.\n\n[Image 7: reporting for ad agencies][Image 8: reporting for ad agencies]\n\nKnow exactly which channel is over- and under-performing.

Others may waste your time because you\u2019ll have to spend your resources to promote them.\n\nIn contrast, products like Midas Manifestation show clear signs of a professional affiliate offer:\n\n  * You get an email swipe file with well-performing email templates.\n  * They offer a Facebook Ad kit and plenty of banners.\n  * Need help? They have a support team that you can contact.\n\nSince products like Midas Manifestation support different channels, ensure your \u301017\u2020multi-platform ad tracking\u3011 is solid.\n\n[Image 11][Image 12]\n\nDon\u2019t waste your budget on ineffective channels and campaigns; identify the best approach with an affiliate-friendly marketing attribution tool like \u301018\u2020RedTrack\u3011.\n\n## 4.

The DIY and woodworking niches are constantly growing, but don\u2019t let existing customers slip away.\u00a0\n\nMeasure your success.

Since we\u2019re going for speed, here\u2019s the easiest setup:\n\n1. **Use Google Sites** or **Carrd.co** to create a simple, free landing page. \n2. **Landing Page Content**:\n   - **Headline**: \u201cUnlock Your True Potential and Manifest Wealth with Midas Manifestation!\u201d\n   - **Short Description**: Explain how Midas Manifestation uses unique sound frequencies to activate hidden chakras, helping people achieve financial freedom and success.\n   - **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: Add a button or link with your affiliate link, e.g., \u201cLearn How Midas Manifestation Can Change Your Life!\u201d\n\n*Tip*: You can skip the landing page and send traffic directly to the Midas Manifestation affiliate link, though a landing page typically increases trust and conversion.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Create a Simple Facebook Ad (If You Want to Use Paid Ads)\nFor a low-budget, beginner-friendly ad, Facebook Ads is ideal. Here\u2019s how to set it up quickly:\n\n1. **Create a New Ad Campaign**: Choose \u201cTraffic\u201d as your campaign objective.\n2. **Audience Targeting**:\n   - **Location**: Start with your country or target English-speaking countries.\n   - **Interests**: Target interests like \u201cManifestation,\u201d \u201cPersonal Development,\u201d or \u201cLaw of Attraction.\u201d\n3. **Budget**: Set a daily budget, even $10\u2013$15 to start.\n4. **Ad Creative**:\n   - **Image**: Use a calming, spiritual image (like a person meditating or a calming light). Midas Manifestation may have images in the affiliate resources.\n   - **Ad Copy**:\n      - **Headline**: \u201cWant to Manifest Wealth? Here\u2019s How.\u201d\n      - **Text**: \u201cDiscover the secret to unlocking your hidden potential. Learn how sound frequencies can help you manifest wealth and happiness with Midas Manifestation.\u201d\n      - **CTA**: Use \u201cLearn More\u201d as the button, linking to your landing page or directly to your affiliate link.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Track Results and Make Adjustments\nCheck back after a few hours or at the end of the day to see if you\u2019re getting clicks and conversions:\n1. **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: If it\u2019s below 1%, consider tweaking the image or ad copy.\n2. **Conversions**: See if any clicks turned into sales in your ClickBank dashboard. \n\n*Tip*: If you get conversions, reinvest to scale the campaign. If not, try changing the ad image or targeting to improve engagement.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Checklist\n1. **Get Affiliate Link** for Midas Manifestation.\n2. **Create a Quick Landing Page** with a CTA to your affiliate link (optional but ideal).\n3. **Set Up Facebook Ad** targeting \u201cManifestation\u201d and related interests.\n4. **Monitor Results and Adjust** as necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, you can have a live campaign promoting Midas Manifestation in a few hours. It\u2019s beginner-friendly and allows you to start generating commissions with minimal setup. Let me know if you need further help at any step!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Additionally, ClickBank accepts payments in 31 different currencies, which appeals to global customers and makes completing purchases easier.\n\nThe following subjects are covered in this article:\n\n  * How Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Works\n  * Setting Up Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Products\n  * What the Customer Sees\n  * What You See\n  * What the Affiliate Sees\n  * Localizing Your Pitch Page Automatically\n  * Additional Resources &amp; Related Articles\n\n[Image 1: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  How Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Works\n\n## Product Types\n\nMulti-lingual capability is available for all product types\u00a0- standard or recurring billing products, as well as both digital and physical products.\n\n### Physical Products\n\nYou can sell physical products in multiple countries by configuring a Shipping Profile that specifies in what countries the product may be purchased. See the \u301022\u2020Selling Physical Products\u3011\u00a0article for more information.\n\n### Digital Products or Services\n\nClickBank requires that your digital product or service is provided in the language specified.\n\n## Pitch Page\n\nIt is recommended that your product Pitch Page be presented in the same\u00a0language as the product itself to reduce customer confusion and prevent high return and chargeback rates.\n\n## Thank You Page\n\nClickBank requires that your Thank You Page content is presented in the language specified for your product to reduce customer confusion and ultimately prevent high return and chargeback rates.\n\n## Customer Service\n\nClickBank will provide initial phone and email customer service in the language specified for the product. Sellers must be capable of servicing technical support requests or customer inquiries in the language specified for the product.\n\n## Payment Methods\n\nThe payment methods offered to customers during the checkout process may vary based on your account Order Form Control settings.\n\n##  Currencies\n\nClickBank retails internationally by accepting all of the currencies listed in the \u301023\u2020Currencies ClickBank Accepts\u3011 article.\n\nThe ClickBank multi-currency feature is available on the Clickbank Order Form and is automatically enabled for all accounts and products. During product setup, you\u00a0specify a default currency for your product. ClickBank will then present the product in the specified default currency for customers in a geographic location that utilizes that currency. Customers from other geographic locations will see a converted currency most appropriate for their location.\n\nFor example, a seller with a French audience may choose Euros as their default currency and display the product price in Euros on their pitch page. If a potential customer located in France clicks to purchase the product, ClickBank will display the price in Euros on the order form. However, if a potential customer located in New Zealand clicks to purchase the product, ClickBank will convert and display the price in New Zealand Dollars on the order form.\n\nUltimately, this flexibility increases the likelihood of making a sale by allowing sellers to specifically target their audience, while still allowing all potential buyers to make purchases in their local currency. All transactions are converted to USD and applied to your account at the time of purchase. The exchange rate is updated daily. For more information, please see our \u301024\u2020Accounting Policy\u3011.\n\n[Image 2: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  Setting Up Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Products\n\nTo implement a non-English product with a default currency, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Log in to your ClickBank account.\n  2. Click the Vendor Settings\u00a0tab.\n  3. Click\u00a0My Products.\n  4. Select the product using one of the following methods: \n     * Click the Edit icon for one of your existing products.\n     * Create a new product using the instructions in the\u00a0\u301025\u2020Creating Your First Product\u3011\u00a0article.\n  5. Use the Language and Product Currency fields to specify the product&#x27;s language and default currency.\n  6. Finish creating the product or click\u00a0Save Changes.\n\n[Image 3: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Customer Sees\n\nClickBank communicates with you and the customer each step of the way. This section outlines how customers will interact with both your product or service and ClickBank during the purchase of a non-English language or non-USD currency product. The following steps occur when a customer purchases a non-English or non-USD currency product:\n\n  1. The customer arrives at your product&#x27;s Pitch Page and clicks to buy your non-English language or non-USD currency product.\n  2. The customer is taken to the ClickBank Order Form where they enter their\u00a0payment information. The Order Form is displayed in the language and currency you&#x27;ve specified during product creation, unless the customer is in a geographic location that uses a different currency.\n  3. The customer clicks the Pay Now button.\n  4. Once the customer&#x27;s payment information is authorized, they are\u00a0sent to the order confirmation page, which is presented in the language selected during product setup and reflects the currency used to purchase. The order confirmation page then leads to your language-specific Thank You Page.\n  5. ClickBank delivers an email notification to the customer summarizing the purchase in the language specified during the product setup and reflecting the currency used to purchase. All customer-facing notifications are provided in the language specified for the product.\n\n[Image 4: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Seller Sees\u00a0\n\nThis section outlines what you can expect to see during a customer&#x27;s purchase of your language or currency specific product or service:\n\nNOTE \u2013 All transactions are converted to USD and applied to your account at the time of purchase.\n\n  1. Once the customer&#x27;s payment information is authorized, ClickBank delivers an English email notification to you, alerting you of the purchase. ClickBank also creates an entry in Transaction Reporting which highlights the currency used during the purchase and the amount you earned in USD.\n  2. If a customer requires technical support, ClickBank will deliver an English email notification to you with the customer&#x27;s comments in either the header or footer of the notifications. The customer&#x27;s comments are provided in the language received.\n\n[Image 5: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Affiliate Sees\n\nThe \u301026\u2020Marketplace\u2020accounts.clickbank.com\u3011 features a filter for language, allowing affiliates to easily find sellers offering multi-lingual products.\n\n[Image 6: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  Localizing Your Pitch Page Automatically\n\nA great way to improve your site&#x27;s conversion rates among international customers is to have your Pitch Page automatically displayed in the appropriate language when a visitor arrives. To do this, you need to first translate your page into multiple languages, and then put PHP code in place that will display a particular version of your site based on the visitor&#x27;s browser language settings. The following is a PHP script we created that should help you accomplish this. You&#x27;ll need to customize it to work with your site.\n\n    &lt;?php  \n    $language = $_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE&quot;];  \n    if(preg_match(&#x27;/^de.*/&#x27;, $language)) {  \n    // imports german content page   \n    include(&quot;german.html&quot;); }  \n    else if (preg_match(&#x27;/^en.*/&#x27;, $language)) {  \n    //imports english content page   \n    include(&quot;english.html&quot;); }  \n    else {  \n    // imports english content page when language is not english or german   \n    include(&quot;english.html&quot;); }  \n    ?&gt;\n\n# \u00a0\n\n[Image 7: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n## Additional Resources &amp; Related Articles\n\n  * \u301027\u2020Creating Your First Product\u3011 \u2013 This article describes the process of creating a product.\n  * \u301028\u2020Selling Physical Products\u3011 \u2013 This article explains how to sell and ship physical products.\n  * \u301029\u2020Accounting Policy\u3011 \u2013 This article explains our legal policies for currency exchanges and payments.\n\n[Image 8: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n  * \u301030\u2020 \u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 \n  * \u301031\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \n\n\u301033\u2020Return to top\u3011 \n\n## Related articles\n\n  * \u301034\u2020Getting Started With Your ClickBank Primary (aka Master) Account\u3011 \n  * \u301035\u2020Selling Physical Products\u3011 \n  * \u301036\u2020What curr", "title": "Offering Products Globally \u2013 ClickBank Knowledge Base", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "Offering Products Globally \u2013 ClickBank Knowledge Base", "url": "https://support.clickbank.com/hc/en-us/articles/220364487-Offering-Products-Globally", "text": "Menu \n\n  * \u30104\u2020ClickBank.com\u2020www.clickbank.com\u3011\n  * \u30105\u2020Blog\u2020www.clickbank.com\u3011\n  * \u30106\u2020ClickBank Education\u2020www.clickbank.com\u3011\n  * \u30107\u2020Create A ClickBank Account\u2020accounts.clickbank.com\u3011\n  * \u30101\u2020Find My Order \u2020www.clkbank.com\u3011\n  * \u30108\u2020Login\u2020accounts.clickbank.com\u3011\n  * \u30102\u2020Submit a request\u3011\n\n  1. \u30100\u2020ClickBank Knowledge Base\u3011 \n  2. \u30109\u2020Seller Help\u3011 \n  3. \u301010\u2020Sales Flow Tools\u3011 \n\n### Articles in this section\n\n  * \u301011\u2020Automated Abandoned Cart Emails \u3011 \n  * \u301012\u2020How do I enable ClickBank Seller features? \u3011 \n  * \u301013\u2020[LEGACY FEATURE] Countdown Timers\u3011 \n  * \u301014\u2020[LEGACY FEATURE] Using Exit Offers\u3011 \n  * \u301015\u2020How do I use multi-option upsells in an upsell flow? \u3011 \n  * \u301016\u2020[LEGACY FEATURE] Basic Custom Order Form\u3011 \n  * \u301017\u2020[LEGACY FEATURE] Advanced Custom Order Form\u3011 \n  * \u301018\u2020Cart Abandonment \u3011 \n  * \u301019\u2020Editable Quantity on the Order Form \u3011 \n  * \u301020\u2020Query String Parameters\u3011 \n\n\u301010\u2020See more\u3011 \n\n#  Offering Products Globally \n\n[Image 0: Avatar] \n\n\u301021\u2020 Owen Allen \u3011 \n\nUpdated August 14, 2024 21:41\n\n## Overview\n\nSellers can offer products on ClickBank in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese.

Products like **Midas Manifestation** and **Moon Reading** are great examples with resources that make them relatively easy to adapt for Italian-speaking customers. Additionally, ClickBank allows for localization in both language and currency, meaning you can market these products in Italian with the price shown in euros, enhancing local appeal.\n\nFor the most straightforward entry, **Midas Manifestation** offers affiliate resources like email swipes and Facebook ad kits. This product is already established as a high-converting offer in the spirituality niche with a gravity score above 100, indicating popularity and solid performance among affiliates. **Moon Reading** also has a high gravity score and performs well in the astrology space, attracting spiritually inclined audiences interested in personalized readings. \n\nFor a quick start in the Italian market:\n1. **Promote Midas Manifestation** or **Moon Reading** using localized ads, emphasizing \u201cmanifestazione della ricchezza\u201d or \u201castrologia e crescita personale\u201d as keywords.\n2.

Vincent, having applied these revelations to his own life, experienced unprecedented prosperity in every facet. \n\nRather than hoarding this priceless knowledge, he chose to make it accessible to all, enabling everyone to thrive, find happiness, and lead a stress-free existence. \n\nAll these invaluable insights from the Akashic records are meticulously curated in the Midas Manifestation handbook. To complement this, you&#x27;ll also receive accompanying audio tracks and a handy quick start guide. \n\n [Image 2: Midas Manifestation Author] \n\n## Midas Manifestation Author\n\nThe very first thing when people select any program, they want to know who is the creator of it.  \n\nThe man behind this wonderful manifestation program is Vincent Smith. He is a cultural researcher and wants people to know the power of manifestation for their success.  \n\nSmith also teaches people how to contact universe authorities to achieve wealth, abundance, and health in life.  \n\nHe further defines that there are many secrets and treasures in this universe, and people must know how to achieve them, and it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are. People must put full attention and devotion to this program to become successful in their life.  \n\n### How Does Midas Manifestation Work?\n\n#### Midas Manifestation was created by ancient decoding drawings, texts, and manuscripts. According to Vincent\u2019s research, he discovered 12 Chakras as opposed to 7, as is commonly known.  \n\nThe other five Chakras he found are very powerful and help people tap into a new dimension in the universe. The chakras connect with the universe and help people achieve more extraordinary things in life. \n\nThe five chakras include: \n\n1) Transcendence &amp; Connection to Spirit \n\n2) Sea of the Soul \n\n3) Earth Connection \n\n4) Mind over\n\n5) Matter \n\n6) Universal Unity\n\nThe five hidden chakras are responsible for making individuals more aware of their thoughts and using the power of the mind to manifest successfully.\n\nVincent first started by testing the chakras using audio sounds, and after a while, he could find the correct frequencies. In Midas Manifestation, you will find soundtracks that use frequencies to activate all 12 chakras. The audio tracks balance the 12 chakras in the body and ensure each one performs its purpose.\n\n[Image 3: midas manifestation-prayer] \n\n[Image 4: midas-manifestation-buy] \n\n\u30100\u2020Buy From Official Website\u20208958ffsh1y-ef-nhr7gdtyxtma.hop.clickbank.net\u3011\n\n### How does Midas Manifestation Help Users?\n\n[Image 5: Midas Manifestation] \n\nThe author aims to teach people the hidden concepts of the world through the novel. The eBook and the audio tracks allow users to concentrate fully on multiple chakras. It will enable users to attract fitness, money, passion, and satisfaction. \n\n  1. Users can learn how chakras function in the body.\n  2. Consumers can relate to world consciousness.\n  3. It allows users to understand the universe\u2019s hidden values.\n  4.

Consumers only have to listen to audio tracks and obey the Midas Manifestation directions. \n\n### What\u2019s Included in Midas Manifestation\n\n#### \n\nThe Midas Manifestation Effect uses five audio tracks to increase the chances of abundance. The tracks include:\n\n  * Midas Unleashed:  This focuses on the root chakra to improve the generation of wealth and success of the user.\n  * Manipura Consciousness: This focuses on the solar plexus chakra to improve consciousness and support all chakras. \n  * Manifest Destiny: This focuses on the third eye chakra to connect with an underlying consciousness. \n  * Divine Willingness: This focuses on the crown chakra to introduce more abundance from the universe around them. \n  * Anahata Bliss: This focuses on the heart chakra to reduce the negative thoughts that could inhibit gifts of wealth from the universe.\n\n#### \n\nUsers will receive an e-Book called Midas Manifestation Handbook, which explains everything Vincent learned through his interpretation of the ancient manuscript over 118 pages. In another e-book, users get 128 pages of further information that he\u2019s learned with a known hypnotist.\n\n[Image 6: midas manifestation-book] \n\n##  Midas Manifestation System is the first online program that has introduced the spiritual concept into the manifestation to help people manifest more money, financial freedom, a prosperous career, a loving relationship, and happy life.   \n\n* * *\n\n### Total Value: ~~$133/~~\n\nOnly for: $37/ Limited Time  \nHURRY UP! \n\n\u30100\u2020Buy From Official Website\u20208958ffsh1y-ef-nhr7gdtyxtma.hop.clickbank.net\u3011\n\n[Image 7: the Devotion System Limited Stock Warning]\n\nLIMITED TIME OFFER:  Click To Check If You\u2019re Eligible For Our Midas Manifestation Exclusive Discount.

Vincent, having applied these revelations to his own life, experienced unprecedented prosperity in every facet. \n\nRather than hoarding this priceless knowledge, he chose to make it accessible to all, enabling everyone to thrive, find happiness, and lead a stress-free existence. \n\nAll these invaluable insights from the Akashic records are meticulously curated in the Midas Manifestation handbook. To complement this, you&#x27;ll also receive accompanying audio tracks and a handy quick start guide. \n\n [Image 2: Midas Manifestation Author] \n\n## Midas Manifestation Author\n\nThe very first thing when people select any program, they want to know who is the creator of it.  \n\nThe man behind this wonderful manifestation program is Vincent Smith. He is a cultural researcher and wants people to know the power of manifestation for their success.  \n\nSmith also teaches people how to contact universe authorities to achieve wealth, abundance, and health in life.  \n\nHe further defines that there are many secrets and treasures in this universe, and people must know how to achieve them, and it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are. People must put full attention and devotion to this program to become successful in their life.  \n\n### How Does Midas Manifestation Work?\n\n#### Midas Manifestation was created by ancient decoding drawings, texts, and manuscripts. According to Vincent\u2019s research, he discovered 12 Chakras as opposed to 7, as is commonly known.  \n\nThe other five Chakras he found are very powerful and help people tap into a new dimension in the universe. The chakras connect with the universe and help people achieve more extraordinary things in life. \n\nThe five chakras include: \n\n1) Transcendence &amp; Connection to Spirit \n\n2) Sea of the Soul \n\n3) Earth Connection \n\n4) Mind over\n\n5) Matter \n\n6) Universal Unity\n\nThe five hidden chakras are responsible for making individuals more aware of their thoughts and using the power of the mind to manifest successfully.\n\nVincent first started by testing the chakras using audio sounds, and after a while, he could find the correct frequencies. In Midas Manifestation, you will find soundtracks that use frequencies to activate all 12 chakras. The audio tracks balance the 12 chakras in the body and ensure each one performs its purpose.\n\n[Image 3: midas manifestation-prayer] \n\n[Image 4: midas-manifestation-buy] \n\n\u30100\u2020Buy From Official Website\u20208958ffsh1y-ef-nhr7gdtyxtma.hop.clickbank.net\u3011\n\n### How does Midas Manifestation Help Users?\n\n[Image 5: Midas Manifestation] \n\nThe author aims to teach people the hidden concepts of the world through the novel. The eBook and the audio tracks allow users to concentrate fully on multiple chakras. It will enable users to attract fitness, money, passion, and satisfaction. \n\n  1. Users can learn how chakras function in the body.\n  2. Consumers can relate to world consciousness.\n  3. It allows users to understand the universe\u2019s hidden values.\n  4.

Consumers only have to listen to audio tracks and obey the Midas Manifestation directions. \n\n### What\u2019s Included in Midas Manifestation\n\n#### \n\nThe Midas Manifestation Effect uses five audio tracks to increase the chances of abundance. The tracks include:\n\n  * Midas Unleashed:  This focuses on the root chakra to improve the generation of wealth and success of the user.\n  * Manipura Consciousness: This focuses on the solar plexus chakra to improve consciousness and support all chakras. \n  * Manifest Destiny: This focuses on the third eye chakra to connect with an underlying consciousness. \n  * Divine Willingness: This focuses on the crown chakra to introduce more abundance from the universe around them. \n  * Anahata Bliss: This focuses on the heart chakra to reduce the negative thoughts that could inhibit gifts of wealth from the universe.\n\n#### \n\nUsers will receive an e-Book called Midas Manifestation Handbook, which explains everything Vincent learned through his interpretation of the ancient manuscript over 118 pages. In another e-book, users get 128 pages of further information that he\u2019s learned with a known hypnotist.\n\n[Image 6: midas manifestation-book] \n\n##  Midas Manifestation System is the first online program that has introduced the spiritual concept into the manifestation to help people manifest more money, financial freedom, a prosperous career, a loving relationship, and happy life.   \n\n* * *\n\n### Total Value: ~~$133/~~\n\nOnly for: $37/ Limited Time  \nHURRY UP! \n\n\u30100\u2020Buy From Official Website\u20208958ffsh1y-ef-nhr7gdtyxtma.hop.clickbank.net\u3011\n\n[Image 7: the Devotion System Limited Stock Warning]\n\nLIMITED TIME OFFER:  Click To Check If You\u2019re Eligible For Our Midas Manifestation Exclusive Discount.

Additionally, ClickBank accepts payments in 31 different currencies, which appeals to global customers and makes completing purchases easier.\n\nThe following subjects are covered in this article:\n\n  * How Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Works\n  * Setting Up Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Products\n  * What the Customer Sees\n  * What You See\n  * What the Affiliate Sees\n  * Localizing Your Pitch Page Automatically\n  * Additional Resources &amp; Related Articles\n\n[Image 1: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  How Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Works\n\n## Product Types\n\nMulti-lingual capability is available for all product types\u00a0- standard or recurring billing products, as well as both digital and physical products.\n\n### Physical Products\n\nYou can sell physical products in multiple countries by configuring a Shipping Profile that specifies in what countries the product may be purchased. See the \u301022\u2020Selling Physical Products\u3011\u00a0article for more information.\n\n### Digital Products or Services\n\nClickBank requires that your digital product or service is provided in the language specified.\n\n## Pitch Page\n\nIt is recommended that your product Pitch Page be presented in the same\u00a0language as the product itself to reduce customer confusion and prevent high return and chargeback rates.\n\n## Thank You Page\n\nClickBank requires that your Thank You Page content is presented in the language specified for your product to reduce customer confusion and ultimately prevent high return and chargeback rates.\n\n## Customer Service\n\nClickBank will provide initial phone and email customer service in the language specified for the product. Sellers must be capable of servicing technical support requests or customer inquiries in the language specified for the product.\n\n## Payment Methods\n\nThe payment methods offered to customers during the checkout process may vary based on your account Order Form Control settings.\n\n##  Currencies\n\nClickBank retails internationally by accepting all of the currencies listed in the \u301023\u2020Currencies ClickBank Accepts\u3011 article.\n\nThe ClickBank multi-currency feature is available on the Clickbank Order Form and is automatically enabled for all accounts and products. During product setup, you\u00a0specify a default currency for your product. ClickBank will then present the product in the specified default currency for customers in a geographic location that utilizes that currency. Customers from other geographic locations will see a converted currency most appropriate for their location.\n\nFor example, a seller with a French audience may choose Euros as their default currency and display the product price in Euros on their pitch page. If a potential customer located in France clicks to purchase the product, ClickBank will display the price in Euros on the order form. However, if a potential customer located in New Zealand clicks to purchase the product, ClickBank will convert and display the price in New Zealand Dollars on the order form.\n\nUltimately, this flexibility increases the likelihood of making a sale by allowing sellers to specifically target their audience, while still allowing all potential buyers to make purchases in their local currency. All transactions are converted to USD and applied to your account at the time of purchase. The exchange rate is updated daily. For more information, please see our \u301024\u2020Accounting Policy\u3011.\n\n[Image 2: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  Setting Up Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Products\n\nTo implement a non-English product with a default currency, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Log in to your ClickBank account.\n  2. Click the Vendor Settings\u00a0tab.\n  3. Click\u00a0My Products.\n  4. Select the product using one of the following methods: \n     * Click the Edit icon for one of your existing products.\n     * Create a new product using the instructions in the\u00a0\u301025\u2020Creating Your First Product\u3011\u00a0article.\n  5. Use the Language and Product Currency fields to specify the product&#x27;s language and default currency.\n  6. Finish creating the product or click\u00a0Save Changes.\n\n[Image 3: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Customer Sees\n\nClickBank communicates with you and the customer each step of the way. This section outlines how customers will interact with both your product or service and ClickBank during the purchase of a non-English language or non-USD currency product. The following steps occur when a customer purchases a non-English or non-USD currency product:\n\n  1. The customer arrives at your product&#x27;s Pitch Page and clicks to buy your non-English language or non-USD currency product.\n  2. The customer is taken to the ClickBank Order Form where they enter their\u00a0payment information. The Order Form is displayed in the language and currency you&#x27;ve specified during product creation, unless the customer is in a geographic location that uses a different currency.\n  3. The customer clicks the Pay Now button.\n  4. Once the customer&#x27;s payment information is authorized, they are\u00a0sent to the order confirmation page, which is presented in the language selected during product setup and reflects the currency used to purchase. The order confirmation page then leads to your language-specific Thank You Page.\n  5. ClickBank delivers an email notification to the customer summarizing the purchase in the language specified during the product setup and reflecting the currency used to purchase. All customer-facing notifications are provided in the language specified for the product.\n\n[Image 4: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Seller Sees\u00a0\n\nThis section outlines what you can expect to see during a customer&#x27;s purchase of your language or currency specific product or service:\n\nNOTE \u2013 All transactions are converted to USD and applied to your account at the time of purchase.\n\n  1. Once the customer&#x27;s payment information is authorized, ClickBank delivers an English email notification to you, alerting you of the purchase. ClickBank also creates an entry in Transaction Reporting which highlights the currency used during the purchase and the amount you earned in USD.\n  2. If a customer requires technical support, ClickBank will deliver an English email notification to you with the customer&#x27;s comments in either the header or footer of the notifications. The customer&#x27;s comments are provided in the language received.\n\n[Image 5: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Affiliate Sees\n\nThe \u301026\u2020Marketplace\u2020accounts.clickbank.com\u3011 features a filter for language, allowing affiliates to easily find sellers offering multi-lingual products.\n\n[Image 6: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  Localizing Your Pitch Page Automatically\n\nA great way to improve your site&#x27;s conversion rates among international customers is to have your Pitch Page automatically displayed in the appropriate language when a visitor arrives. To do this, you need to first translate your page into multiple languages, and then put PHP code in place that will display a particular version of your site based on the visitor&#x27;s browser language settings.

Additionally, ClickBank accepts payments in 31 different currencies, which appeals to global customers and makes completing purchases easier.\n\nThe following subjects are covered in this article:\n\n  * How Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Works\n  * Setting Up Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Products\n  * What the Customer Sees\n  * What You See\n  * What the Affiliate Sees\n  * Localizing Your Pitch Page Automatically\n  * Additional Resources &amp; Related Articles\n\n[Image 1: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  How Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Works\n\n## Product Types\n\nMulti-lingual capability is available for all product types\u00a0- standard or recurring billing products, as well as both digital and physical products.\n\n### Physical Products\n\nYou can sell physical products in multiple countries by configuring a Shipping Profile that specifies in what countries the product may be purchased. See the \u301022\u2020Selling Physical Products\u3011\u00a0article for more information.\n\n### Digital Products or Services\n\nClickBank requires that your digital product or service is provided in the language specified.\n\n## Pitch Page\n\nIt is recommended that your product Pitch Page be presented in the same\u00a0language as the product itself to reduce customer confusion and prevent high return and chargeback rates.\n\n## Thank You Page\n\nClickBank requires that your Thank You Page content is presented in the language specified for your product to reduce customer confusion and ultimately prevent high return and chargeback rates.\n\n## Customer Service\n\nClickBank will provide initial phone and email customer service in the language specified for the product. Sellers must be capable of servicing technical support requests or customer inquiries in the language specified for the product.\n\n## Payment Methods\n\nThe payment methods offered to customers during the checkout process may vary based on your account Order Form Control settings.\n\n##  Currencies\n\nClickBank retails internationally by accepting all of the currencies listed in the \u301023\u2020Currencies ClickBank Accepts\u3011 article.\n\nThe ClickBank multi-currency feature is available on the Clickbank Order Form and is automatically enabled for all accounts and products. During product setup, you\u00a0specify a default currency for your product. ClickBank will then present the product in the specified default currency for customers in a geographic location that utilizes that currency. Customers from other geographic locations will see a converted currency most appropriate for their location.\n\nFor example, a seller with a French audience may choose Euros as their default currency and display the product price in Euros on their pitch page. If a potential customer located in France clicks to purchase the product, ClickBank will display the price in Euros on the order form. However, if a potential customer located in New Zealand clicks to purchase the product, ClickBank will convert and display the price in New Zealand Dollars on the order form.\n\nUltimately, this flexibility increases the likelihood of making a sale by allowing sellers to specifically target their audience, while still allowing all potential buyers to make purchases in their local currency. All transactions are converted to USD and applied to your account at the time of purchase. The exchange rate is updated daily. For more information, please see our \u301024\u2020Accounting Policy\u3011.\n\n[Image 2: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  Setting Up Multi-Lingual and Multi-Currency Products\n\nTo implement a non-English product with a default currency, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Log in to your ClickBank account.\n  2. Click the Vendor Settings\u00a0tab.\n  3. Click\u00a0My Products.\n  4. Select the product using one of the following methods: \n     * Click the Edit icon for one of your existing products.\n     * Create a new product using the instructions in the\u00a0\u301025\u2020Creating Your First Product\u3011\u00a0article.\n  5. Use the Language and Product Currency fields to specify the product&#x27;s language and default currency.\n  6. Finish creating the product or click\u00a0Save Changes.\n\n[Image 3: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Customer Sees\n\nClickBank communicates with you and the customer each step of the way. This section outlines how customers will interact with both your product or service and ClickBank during the purchase of a non-English language or non-USD currency product. The following steps occur when a customer purchases a non-English or non-USD currency product:\n\n  1. The customer arrives at your product&#x27;s Pitch Page and clicks to buy your non-English language or non-USD currency product.\n  2. The customer is taken to the ClickBank Order Form where they enter their\u00a0payment information. The Order Form is displayed in the language and currency you&#x27;ve specified during product creation, unless the customer is in a geographic location that uses a different currency.\n  3. The customer clicks the Pay Now button.\n  4. Once the customer&#x27;s payment information is authorized, they are\u00a0sent to the order confirmation page, which is presented in the language selected during product setup and reflects the currency used to purchase. The order confirmation page then leads to your language-specific Thank You Page.\n  5. ClickBank delivers an email notification to the customer summarizing the purchase in the language specified during the product setup and reflecting the currency used to purchase. All customer-facing notifications are provided in the language specified for the product.\n\n[Image 4: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Seller Sees\u00a0\n\nThis section outlines what you can expect to see during a customer&#x27;s purchase of your language or currency specific product or service:\n\nNOTE \u2013 All transactions are converted to USD and applied to your account at the time of purchase.\n\n  1. Once the customer&#x27;s payment information is authorized, ClickBank delivers an English email notification to you, alerting you of the purchase. ClickBank also creates an entry in Transaction Reporting which highlights the currency used during the purchase and the amount you earned in USD.\n  2. If a customer requires technical support, ClickBank will deliver an English email notification to you with the customer&#x27;s comments in either the header or footer of the notifications. The customer&#x27;s comments are provided in the language received.\n\n[Image 5: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  What the Affiliate Sees\n\nThe \u301026\u2020Marketplace\u2020accounts.clickbank.com\u3011 features a filter for language, allowing affiliates to easily find sellers offering multi-lingual products.\n\n[Image 6: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n##  Localizing Your Pitch Page Automatically\n\nA great way to improve your site&#x27;s conversion rates among international customers is to have your Pitch Page automatically displayed in the appropriate language when a visitor arrives. To do this, you need to first translate your page into multiple languages, and then put PHP code in place that will display a particular version of your site based on the visitor&#x27;s browser language settings. The following is a PHP script we created that should help you accomplish this. You&#x27;ll need to customize it to work with your site.\n\n    &lt;?php  \n    $language = $_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE&quot;];  \n    if(preg_match(&#x27;/^de.*/&#x27;, $language)) {  \n    // imports german content page   \n    include(&quot;german.html&quot;); }  \n    else if (preg_match(&#x27;/^en.*/&#x27;, $language)) {  \n    //imports english content page   \n    include(&quot;english.html&quot;); }  \n    else {  \n    // imports english content page when language is not english or german   \n    include(&quot;english.html&quot;); }  \n    ?&gt;\n\n# \u00a0\n\n[Image 7: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n## Additional Resources &amp; Related Articles\n\n  * \u301027\u2020Creating Your First Product\u3011 \u2013 This article describes the process of creating a product.\n  * \u301028\u2020Selling Physical Products\u3011 \u2013 This article explains how to sell and ship physical products.\n  * \u301029\u2020Accounting Policy\u3011 \u2013 This article explains our legal policies for currency exchanges and payments.\n\n[Image 8: ClickTip Lightning Bolt]\n\n  * \u301030\u2020 \u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 \n  * \u301031\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \n\n\u301033\u2020Return to top\u3011 \n\n## Related articles\n\n  * \u301034\u2020Getting Started With Your ClickBank Primary (aka Master) Account\u3011 \n  * \u301035\u2020Selling Physical Products\u3011 \n  * \u301036\u2020What curr"}], "gizmo_id": "g-aB11CrrhD", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "aaa29806-d91e-44ae-87f4-9abda4a696aa", "request_id": "8daa22e61e250e07-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa29806-d91e-44ae-87f4-9abda4a696aa", "children": ["aaa27399-0b7a-4f5e-ac4e-b7f01b5af900"]}, "aaa27399-0b7a-4f5e-ac4e-b7f01b5af900": { "message": { "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1730278127.172945, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["and to throw a wrench in the thing, is cpa more profitable? should I look for cpa offers?

Unlike traditional affiliate offers, where commissions are based on sales, CPA networks pay for specific actions, such as generating leads or acquiring sign-ups. Here\u2019s a breakdown of whether CPA might be a better fit for your goals:\n\n### Benefits of CPA Offers\n1. **Lower Commitment from Users**: With CPA, you\u2019re typically compensated when users complete a simple action (e.g., submitting an email or signing up), which often requires less commitment than making a purchase. This can lead to higher conversion rates, especially on social media.\n2. **Faster Turnaround on Earnings**: Since users don\u2019t have to purchase, CPA campaigns can often achieve faster conversions, translating to quicker earnings for you.\n3. **Diverse Niches**: CPA offers span many niches, including finance, gaming, health, and personal development. If you&#x27;re open to exploring beyond manifestation or wealth, CPA offers could provide opportunities to promote in high-demand niches with less competition.\n\n### Downsides of CPA for Quick Earnings\n- **Lower Payouts per Action**: CPA offers generally pay less per action compared to high-ticket affiliate products. While you can earn around $1\u2013$20 per lead, affiliate programs in niches like manifestation or high-ticket sales can bring in $30\u2013$100 or more per sale.\n- **High-Volume Traffic Needed**: With CPA offers, especially those with lower payouts, profitability often depends on driving a significant amount of traffic to achieve meaningful earnings.\n\n### Comparing CPA to Affiliate Offers in Your Case\nIf you\u2019re prioritizing **minimal setup and quick returns**, CPA could be worth testing if you can access offers in related niches, such as personal development or wealth-building sign-ups. For example:\n- Platforms like **MaxBounty** or **CPA Grip** specialize in high-conversion CPA offers and provide tools to promote easily across platforms.\n- **CPA Offers in Finance** or **Wealth Niches**: Some CPA offers focus on lead generation for financial tools, which might be attractive for users interested in wealth creation or manifestation.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re primarily interested in higher per-conversion earnings and don\u2019t want to drive high traffic, **sticking with high-gravity ClickBank offers like The Genius Wave** might yield faster and more substantial results per click. \n\n### Recommendation\nStart with high-gravity affiliate offers on ClickBank, like **The Genius Wave** or **Moon Reading**, to leverage their higher payouts with moderate traffic. Once you get a feel for your audience&#x27;s engagement, you could test CPA offers in parallel, especially in related niches. This way, you benefit from both higher payouts and lower-effort conversions, allowing you to see which approach works best for you."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

In this approach, you cast a wider net using platforms like Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, or Google Display Ads, aiming to get as many people as possible to take a simple action, such as signing up or submitting information.\n\n### Here\u2019s How High-Traffic Strategies Work with CPA Offers:\n1. **Broad Targeting with Minimal Restrictions**: With CPA, you&#x27;re often promoting offers that appeal to a wide demographic (e.g., people interested in financial tips, free trials, or health offers). For these, targeting doesn&#x27;t have to be extremely niche, so broad audience settings on Facebook Ads or TikTok can be effective.\n\n2. **Low-Cost Per Action Goal**: Since CPA offers pay per action (not per sale), you\u2019re generally focused on maximizing clicks and actions at a low cost. By setting a modest cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) bid, you reach more people at a manageable cost, keeping acquisition costs below the CPA payout rate.\n\n3. **Ad Spend and Traffic Volume**: To generate meaningful returns, you\u2019ll want to drive thousands of clicks or impressions, meaning that you may spend aggressively upfront to test what works. With Facebook Ads, for instance, setting an initial budget of $20\u2013$50 per day can help you gauge which ad creatives or audience segments convert the best.\n\n4. **Automation &amp; Optimization**: Running broad campaigns with CPA offers lets Facebook\u2019s algorithm optimize for high engagement and low-cost actions. You can start broad, observe which audience segments perform well, and adjust based on data to improve return on ad spend (ROAS).\n\n### Pros and Cons of Casting a Wide Net with Ads\n\n- **Pros**:\n   - **Quick Data Collection**: You\u2019ll quickly see which ads convert and can refine your targeting.\n   - **Low-Commitment Audience Actions**: Users only need to submit information rather than make a purchase, leading to higher conversion rates.\n\n- **Cons**:\n   - **High Upfront Spend**: This approach may require $100\u2013$200+ in initial ad spend to collect enough data for optimizations.\n   - **Lower Payouts Per Action**: CPA payouts per lead or sign-up tend to be lower, so you\u2019ll need volume to see significant returns.\n\n### Final Recommendation\nIf you\u2019re ready to invest upfront in ad spend and want to test a high-traffic approach, CPA offers could be worthwhile. However, if you&#x27;d prefer a lower budget to start or want to prioritize higher payouts per conversion, sticking with high-gravity ClickBank affiliate offers like **The Genius Wave** or **Moon Reading** may offer a better balance of effort and return."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Since both products have high gravity scores and proven conversion potential, you can approach them with either targeted or broader traffic strategies, depending on your budget and goals.\n\n### Step 1: Choose an Ad Platform\nFor a quick start, consider **Facebook Ads** or **Instagram Ads**, as both are ideal for reaching audiences interested in spirituality and self-improvement.\n\n- **Facebook Ads**: Known for its detailed targeting options, Facebook is great for testing specific interest groups.\n- **Instagram Ads**: Ideal if you\u2019re targeting younger demographics who engage with visually appealing, short-form content.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Campaigns\nUsing each product link, here\u2019s how to set up campaigns with minimal effort:\n\n1. **Ad Objective**: Choose \u201cTraffic\u201d to drive clicks to your affiliate links or landing page.\n2. **Audience Targeting**:\n   - For **The Genius Wave**: Target interests like \u201cself-improvement,\u201d \u201cbrainwave technology,\u201d \u201cneuroscience,\u201d and \u201cmindfulness.\u201d\n   - For **Moon Reading**: Focus on \u201castrology,\u201d \u201choroscopes,\u201d and \u201cspirituality.\u201d\n3. **Budget**: Start with $10\u2013$20 per day for each product. Monitor and adjust based on which product gains more clicks or conversions.\n\n### Step 3: Ad Creative\n**Images and Copy**:\n   - **Genius Wave**: Use a calming image, like a person meditating or a brain visualization. \n     - *Copy Suggestion*: \u201cUnlock your hidden genius potential with sound waves scientifically designed to elevate your mind. Discover The Genius Wave!\u201d\n   - **Moon Reading**: Use an astrology-themed image or celestial visuals.\n     - *Copy Suggestion*: \u201cCurious about what the stars say about your future? Discover a personalized astrology reading with Moon Reading!\u201d\n\n**Call-to-Action (CTA)**: Use \u201cLearn More\u201d or \u201cDiscover Now\u201d to encourage clicks.\n\n### Step 4: Monitor and Optimize\nAfter a few days, review your ad performance:\n- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Aim for a CTR above 1%.

However, adding a simple landing page can improve your conversions by warming up traffic and filtering out unqualified clicks.\n\n### Option 1: No Landing Page (Direct Link in Ads)\nIf speed is your priority, you can create a Facebook ad campaign and link directly to your affiliate links. This will work well with small budgets, allowing you to test quickly.\n\n1. **Create the Ad Campaign** in Facebook Ads Manager.\n2. **Target Your Audience** with interests related to \u201cself-improvement,\u201d \u201castrology,\u201d or \u201cspirituality,\u201d depending on the offer.\n3. **Ad Content**:\n   - Use engaging images (e.g., brain waves for Genius Wave, celestial visuals for Moon Reading).\n   - Add a brief, benefit-focused description.\n   - Link directly to your ClickBank affiliate link in the ad\u2019s CTA button.\n\n**Pros**: Fast and straightforward; you can get ads running quickly.\n**Cons**: You may get lower conversions as users land on the affiliate page without additional context.\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Simple Landing Page\nIf you have time for an extra step, creating a basic landing page can help pre-sell the offer, increase trust, and boost conversion rates. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. **Use a Free Page Builder**: Platforms like Google Sites or Carrd make it easy to create a single-page landing page.\n2. **Content on Landing Page**:\n   - Add a short description of the benefits (e.g., \u201cDiscover the power of sound waves to unlock your genius\u201d for The Genius Wave).\n   - Include a strong CTA button (\u201cGet Started\u201d or \u201cLearn More\u201d) linking to your affiliate link.\n3. **Direct Ads to Your Landing Page**: Run the Facebook ad but link to your landing page instead. This way, visitors see a warm-up page that primes them for the affiliate product.\n\n**Pros**: Higher conversion potential, better user experience.\n**Cons**: Slightly longer setup time.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Next Step\nIf you\u2019re looking for the fastest route, go ahead with **Option 1** and set up the Facebook ad directly to your affiliate link. Once you see results, you can add a landing page later to refine the funnel and improve conversions further. \n\nThis lets you start collecting data quickly, giving you insights into how well each product resonates with your audience."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It\u2019s user-friendly and flexible, perfect for building compliant affiliate landing pages. Here\u2019s how to adapt the suggested layout for Carrd:\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Carrd Landing Page Setup for Moon Reading**\n\n#### **1. Create a New Page in Carrd**\n   - Choose a single-page template to keep it simple and streamlined.\n   - Select a theme with a calming or minimalist aesthetic to reflect the astrology niche.\n\n#### **2. Page Sections &amp; Content Setup**\n\n- **Hero Section (Top of Page)**:\n   - **Headline**: Use the headline \u201cUnlock Your Astrological Blueprint for a Life of Prosperity and Abundance!\u201d in a larger, bold font.\n   - **Background Image**: Choose a subtle celestial background image (Carrd has image options, or you can upload your own), ideally showing a moon or starry night sky to capture the astrology theme.\n   - **Description**: Add a short description beneath the headline, like \u201cDiscover insights into your true potential with a personalized moon reading. This unique video experience reveals astrological insights that can guide your journey to abundance, love, and purpose.\u201d\n\n- **Middle Section (Social Proof &amp; Details)**:\n   - **Subheading**: \u201cJoin Over 1.4 Million People Who Have Experienced Life-Changing Revelations\u201d\n   - **Description**: Follow up with, \u201cFind out how personalized moon readings have empowered countless individuals to unlock a deeper understanding of themselves and their journey.\u201d\n   - **Testimonials**: Add a few brief, generic testimonials or statements about astrology\u2019s benefits (without mentioning \u201cMoon Reading\u201d by name). This can create credibility without violating brand guidelines.\n\n- **Call-to-Action Section**:\n   - **Button**: Create a prominent button that says, \u201cStart My Personalized Moon Reading.\u201d\n   - **Linking**: Connect this button to your ClickBank affiliate link (don\u2019t link directly to the order form). Make sure the button stands out with a contrasting color, like a calming blue or soft green.\n\n#### **3. Footer and Disclaimer**\n   - **Footer Disclaimer**: Include a brief line such as, \u201cThis page is intended to share general information and is not the official Moon Reading website.\u201d\n   - **Privacy and Compliance Notes**: Add links to a basic privacy policy and terms if Carrd\u2019s template allows. It\u2019s good practice for compliance and shows professionalism.\n\n---\n\n### **Carrd-Specific Compliance Tips**\n\n- **Avoid Official Logos**: Only use celestial or abstract images to avoid resembling official Moon Reading branding.\n- **Natural Language**: Keep the language friendly and conversational, focusing on the benefits of a \u201cpersonalized astrological reading\u201d rather than direct claims.\n\nWith Carrd, this setup should look clean and inviting, while also being easy to replicate or modify if needed. Once complete, you can start driving traffic to this landing page through social media or other compliant channels.

By setting up **Lexology Enterprises** as the overarching brand, you\u2019ll have a versatile foundation for creating distinct campaigns, each as a unique **Lexanova Corp.** experience or branded project. This structure gives you the flexibility to rebrand for each campaign, experiment with different niches, and maintain a cohesive identity under Lexology.\n\nHere&#x27;s how to make it work effectively:\n\n1. **Lexology Enterprises (Umbrella Brand)**  \n   - **Brand Identity**: Lexology can be positioned as a brand dedicated to transformation, insights, and knowledge\u2014a perfect match for ventures in personal development, lifestyle, or even tech. \n   - **Website and Legal Presence**: Establish Lexology Enterprises as your main entity with a website that includes pages like \u201cOur Brands\u201d or \u201cProjects.\u201d This provides legitimacy and allows easy brand extension.\n\n2. **Lexanova Corp. Campaigns**  \n   - **Project-Based Flexibility**: Each campaign (e.g., a personalized astrology quiz, a wellness course) can be branded under \u201cLexanova Corp.\u201d with a fresh experience and look. For example, \u201cLexanova Corp: Moon Insights\u201d or \u201cLexanova Corp: Prosperity Pathways.\u201d\n   - **Unique Landing Pages**: Design a new Carrd or custom landing page per Lexanova Corp. campaign, with each page introducing it as a &quot;new experience&quot; under Lexology.\n   - **Subdomain Branding**: Use subdomains like mooninsights.lexology.com for each experience if you set up a main Lexology site, giving each campaign a unique feel under the umbrella.\n\n3. **Legal and Trademarking**  \n   - **Lexology Enterprises** as a registered entity can protect the Lexology name, while Lexanova Corp. can be used as a project brand rather than an official registered corporation. You might consider trademarking Lexology Enterprises and Lexanova for added security if the brand grows.\n\nWith this approach, you\u2019re free to adapt branding for different audiences and campaign goals while building a strong, recognizable brand architecture.
