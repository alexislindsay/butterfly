Presentation Language (APL) document, which is a system that allows you to create rich visual displays for Alexa-enabled devices like Echo Show. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the important elements:\n\n### Key Elements of the JSON:\n\n1. **Namespace**: \n   - `&quot;namespace&quot;: &quot;Alexa.Presentation.APL&quot;` indicates that this is an APL document being rendered, meaning it&#x27;s handling some visual output on a supported device.\n\n2. **APL Version**:\n   - The `&quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.9&quot;` specifies the APL version being used.\n\n3. **Document Structure**:\n   - The document contains a layout for traffic or route details, including travel time, travel distance, and different routes (`&quot;fastestRoute&quot;`, `&quot;alternativeRouteSummary&quot;`). These are presented in various containers and layouts, depending on the device&#x27;s viewport (like size, resolution, etc.).\n\n4. **Viewports**:\n   - The `supportedViewports` section defines how the document should render on different devices (e.g., round or rectangular screens, TVs, or mobile devices). The view adapts depending on the screen size and shape.\n\n5. **Data Sources**:\n   - The `datasources` section holds dynamic data about the routes, such as:\n     - Travel time and distance for different routes (e.g., &quot;via Via Raffaele Costi and A24&quot; or &quot;via A24 and SR5&quot;).\n     - Icons for traffic conditions and other display elements.\n\n6. **APL Components**:\n   - The document makes heavy use of APL components such as `Container`, `Text`, `Image`, and custom layouts like `SummaryPage`, `TravelTime`, `TravelDistance`, and others.\n   - These components dynamically adjust to the viewport&#x27;s characteristics.\n\n### Important Points:\n- **The primary purpose of this document**: It is rendering information about traffic conditions and alternative routes. \n- **Presentation Token**: The `&quot;presentationToken&quot;` seems to relate to the session tied to this APL rendering, potentially to identify it for a specific interaction.\n- **Customization for Different Viewports**: The document adjusts layouts and text sizes depending on the device, which is essential for ensuring a good user experience on both small and large devices.\n- **APL Commands**: There\u2019s a command section (`&quot;commands&quot;`) that auto-pages the content after a certain delay (defined by `@autoPageDelayInMs`), likely for showing multiple pages of content.\n\n### Errors?\nIf you&#x27;re seeing issues with this payload in your testing:\n- **Ensure all external resources** (like background images or icons) are accessible.\n- **Check supported device compatibility**: Ensure the device you&#x27;re testing on supports APL rendering and matches the viewport profile.\n- **Timing or AutoPage Command**: If the content seems to timeout or not display properly, verify the AutoPage command timing or other commands under the `commands` section.\n\nIf you&#x27;re trying to debug an issue related to this APL document rendering, I recommend:\n1. **Checking CloudWatch Logs** for any errors in rendering.\n2. **Validating all dynamic data** in the `datasources` section to ensure no missing or incorrectly formatted data.\n3. **Testing on different device types** (e.g., Echo Show) to ensure the layout works as expected across different viewport profiles.\n\nWould you like help troubleshooting or modifying this APL document?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s why:\n\n- The **`ConsideredIntents`** section lists the intents that Alexa is reviewing for the current session, but it shows that only intents from **different skills** are being evaluated (indicated by `&quot;name&quot;: &quot;&lt;IntentForDifferentSkill&gt;&quot;`). \n- Your specific intent (e.g., `GetAIResponseIntent`) isn&#x27;t in this list, suggesting that Alexa isn&#x27;t considering or triggering it based on the user input or current session context.\n\n### Possible reasons why your intent isn&#x27;t being invoked:\n1. **Incorrect invocation**: The user might not be using the correct invocation phrase or utterance to trigger your intent.\n2. **Skill configuration**: There might be an issue with how your skill&#x27;s intents are configured in the Alexa Developer Console. For example, your intent might not be mapped to the utterance the user is providing.\n3. **Dialog management**: If there\u2019s a dialog session or other states that are prioritizing different intents, your intent might not be getting selected.\n4. **Skill\u2019s interaction model**: The model might not be adequately trained on utterances that correspond to your intent, causing Alexa to consider other intents instead.\n\n### What you can do to troubleshoot:\n1. **Check the invocation phrases** in your Alexa Developer Console for your `GetAIResponseIntent` and ensure they&#x27;re appropriately configured for the phrases your users are saying.\n2. **Test your skill** with a specific utterance in the Alexa Simulator and check if your intent is being invoked properly.\n3. **Check the CloudWatch logs** or Alexa Skill Metrics for more detailed logging on how Alexa is matching user utterances to intents.\n4. **Adjust your interaction model**: Add more sample utterances and make sure they&#x27;re unique enough to avoid conflict with other intents or skills.\n\nIf the issue persists, you might need to refine the sample utterances and potentially re-deploy the updated interaction model. Would you like more guidance on how to configure this in the developer console?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of what&#x27;s happening:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Intent was recognized and invoked**: The `&quot;GetAIResponseIntent&quot;` intent was triggered successfully, with the user query `&quot;the relationship between cops and donuts&quot;`. This means your skill&#x27;s invocation is working properly.\n   \n2. **InvocationResponse indicates an error**: The skill responded with an SSML message:\n   ```json\n   &quot;outputSpeech&quot;: {\n       &quot;type&quot;: &quot;SSML&quot;,\n       &quot;ssml&quot;: &quot;&lt;speak&gt;Sorry, I encountered an error processing your request.&lt;/speak&gt;&quot;\n   }\n   ```\n   This indicates that an error occurred within the skill&#x27;s processing logic after the intent was triggered.\n\n3. **Execution time**: The skill execution took approximately 1053 milliseconds, which indicates the request went through, but something went wrong in the logic before it could return a proper result.\n\n### What could be causing the error?\n- **Lambda function error**: If your skill is backed by an AWS Lambda function, there might be an issue with the code that processes the request. This could be an unhandled exception, missing API response, or any number of logical issues.\n  \n- **API failure**: If your skill relies on an external API (e.g., OpenAI), the error could be related to a failure in calling that API or receiving the response.\n\n- **Slot handling or data parsing**: There could be an issue with how the query slot is being handled in your Lambda function (e.g., the value of `&quot;query&quot;` might not be processed correctly).\n\n### Next Steps for Debugging:\n1. **Check AWS CloudWatch Logs**: \n   - Look at the Lambda logs in **CloudWatch** to find details about what went wrong during the request. The logs should contain the exact error message or stack trace that caused the skill to fail.\n   \n2. **Error handling in Lambda**:\n   - Ensure proper error handling in your Lambda function so that errors are logged and gracefully handled. You could add a try-catch block to catch exceptions and log more details.\n   \n3. **Test API interactions**: \n   - If your skill calls an external API (e.g., OpenAI), test the API call separately to ensure it&#x27;s functioning correctly and returning the expected response.\n\n4. **Debug locally**: \n   - Test your skill&#x27;s logic locally or using AWS Lambda&#x27;s test feature with the same input to pinpoint where the error occurs.\n\nThis response suggests that the intent trigger is working fine, but the error lies within the skill&#x27;s processing logic. Checking CloudWatch logs and handling errors more robustly in your code will help identify the root cause."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This will typically involve:\n  - An HTTP request to an API endpoint.\n  - Passing parameters such as the user\u2019s input or query.\n  - Receiving and handling the API&#x27;s response.\n\n### Step 2: Extract the API Request Code\n- Isolate the section of your Lambda function that makes the API call.\n- For example, in Node.js, it might look something like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n\nasync function callOpenAI(query) {\n    const response = await axios.post(&#x27;https://api.openai.com/v1/completions&#x27;, {\n        prompt: query,\n        max_tokens: 50,\n        temperature: 0.7\n    }, {\n        headers: {\n            &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,\n            &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n        }\n    });\n    \n    return response.data;\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Test the API Call Locally\n#### Option 1: Use Postman\n1. **Download and Install Postman** (if not already installed): [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)\n   \n2. **Create a new HTTP request**:\n   - Set the method to `POST`.\n   - Enter the API endpoint (e.g., for OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com/v1/completions`).\n\n3. **Add Authorization Header**:\n   - Go to the &quot;Authorization&quot; tab or add the `Authorization` header manually.\n   - For OpenAI, you\u2019ll need to provide your Bearer Token, like so:\n     ```\n     Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\n     ```\n\n4. **Set the Body**:\n   - Choose `raw` and `JSON` format for the body.\n   - Input a JSON payload that matches what your Lambda function is sending, for example:\n     ```json\n     {\n       &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;the relationship between cops and donuts&quot;,\n       &quot;max_tokens&quot;: 50,\n       &quot;temperature&quot;: 0.7\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Send the Request**:\n   - Click the **Send** button.\n   - Postman will display the API response, including status code, response body, and any error details. If you receive a valid response, it means the API is working fine.\n\n#### Option 2: Use a Local Script\nIf you prefer to use code instead of Postman:\n\n1. **Create a new script** (in JavaScript, Python, etc.) to run locally.\n2. Copy the API call logic from your Lambda function into the script.\n3. Modify the query and ensure that the headers and body are correct.\n4. **Run the script locally** to check the API response.\n\nFor example, in Node.js:\n\n```javascript\nconst axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n\nasync function testAPI() {\n    try {\n        const response = await axios.post(&#x27;https://api.openai.com/v1/completions&#x27;, {\n            prompt: &quot;the relationship between cops and donuts&quot;,\n            max_tokens: 50,\n            temperature: 0.7\n        }, {\n            headers: {\n                &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,\n                &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n            }\n        });\n\n        console.log(response.data);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(&quot;Error with API call:&quot;, error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);\n    }\n}\n\ntestAPI();\n```\n\nRun this script locally and check the console output for the API response.\n\n### Step 4: Debug the API Response\n- If the API responds successfully, check what is returned (e.g., the expected text completion for OpenAI).\n- If there is an error, the response should contain details such as:\n  - Invalid API key\n  - Malformed request body\n  - Too many requests (rate-limited)\n  \nThis information will help you debug the API integration in your Lambda function.\n\n### Step 5: Implement API Call in Lambda Function\n- After verifying the API works as expected, return to your Lambda function and ensure that:\n  - The API call is structured correctly.\n  - The data being sent to the API matches the required format.\n  - You handle errors appropriately (e.g., catch and log any errors during the API call).\n\n### Step 6: Monitor Logs in AWS CloudWatch\nAfter testing locally, you can re-deploy your Lambda function and then monitor the logs in **AWS CloudWatch** to ensure the API call is functioning correctly when triggered by your Alexa skill.\n\n#### How to View Logs in CloudWatch:\n1. Go to the **AWS Management Console** and open **CloudWatch**.\n2. Select **Logs** from the left-hand menu.\n3. Find the **log group** for your Lambda function (e.g., `/aws/lambda/YOUR_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`).\n4. Open the most recent log stream to view details of the function\u2019s execution.\n\nLook for errors related to API calls or unhandled exceptions in the log output.\n\n---\n\nThis process should help you verify if the API is working correctly, and once confirmed, you can adjust your Lambda code accordingly to handle any errors and integrate the API smoothly."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Then, these responses are transmitted back to Alexa and presented to the user.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI to use the ChatGPT model. More information on how to do this can be found in the OpenAI API documentation.\n\nOnce you have your API key, simply insert it into the index.js file in the designated location.\n\n## Running the example\n\nThis example was developed using Amazon&#x27;s ASK CLI. To run it, you will need to install the ASK CLI and configure your Amazon Developer account.\n\nOnce configured, simply run the following commands in the terminal:\n\n    ask init\n    ask deploy\n\nThis will deploy your Skill to your Amazon Developer account and make it available for use with Alexa.\n\n## Final considerations\n\nThis is just a basic example of how to use ChatGPT with Alexa. You can expand this implementation to create more complex and personalized skills. Enjoy!\n\n## About\n\nThis is an Alexa bot developed with the help of OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT language model.

Then, these responses are transmitted back to Alexa and presented to the user.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI to use the ChatGPT model. More information on how to do this can be found in the OpenAI API documentation.\n\nOnce you have your API key, simply insert it into the index.js file in the designated location.\n\n## Running the example\n\nThis example was developed using Amazon&#x27;s ASK CLI. To run it, you will need to install the ASK CLI and configure your Amazon Developer account.\n\nOnce configured, simply run the following commands in the terminal:\n\n    ask init\n    ask deploy\n\nThis will deploy your Skill to your Amazon Developer account and make it available for use with Alexa.\n\n## Final considerations\n\nThis is just a basic example of how to use ChatGPT with Alexa. You can expand this implementation to create more complex and personalized skills. Enjoy!\n\n## About\n\nThis is an Alexa bot developed with the help of OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT language model. With it, you can converse naturally with Alexa, answering questions and performing tasks based on its language training. \n\n\u301046\u2020bit.ly/3wUKdIz\u2020bit.ly\u3011 \n\n### Topics\n\n\u301067\u2020 javascript \u3011 \u301068\u2020 chat \u3011 \u301069\u2020 alexa \u3011 \u301070\u2020 axios \u3011 \u301071\u2020 chat-gpt \u3011 \n\n### Resources\n\nReadme \n\n\u301051\u2020 Activity \u3011 \n\n### Stars\n\n\u301047\u2020 190 stars \u3011 \n\n### Watchers\n\n\u301072\u2020 7 watching \u3011 \n\n### Forks\n\n\u301048\u2020 48 forks \u3011 \n\n\u301073\u2020 Report repository \u3011 \n\n##  \u301074\u2020 Releases \u3011\n\nNo releases published\n\n##  \u301075\u2020 Packages 0 \u3011\n\nNo packages published   \n\n##  \u301076\u2020 Contributors 2 \u3011\n\n  * \u301043\u2020 \u3011  \u30104", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "mclick", "args": ["[0, 1, 8, 16]"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "6036f1ab-60a7-46d1-9199-2754a3bfcf39", "request_id": "8d1fb9c0887abadf-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "6036f1ab-60a7-46d1-9199-2754a3bfcf39", "children": ["f4dfc757-99ea-4881-bd4b-bc2bdae243a8"]}, "f4dfc757-99ea-4881-bd4b-bc2bdae243a8": { "message": { "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1728826675.305252, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "https://github.com/bsab/Alexa-AI-Skill", "domain": "github.com", "text": "  * \u301053\u2020 Pull requests 0 \u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020 Actions \u3011\n  * \u301055\u2020 Projects 0 \u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020 Security \u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020 Insights \u3011\n\n  Additional navigation options  \n\n  * \u301044\u2020 Code \u3011 \n  * \u301052\u2020 Issues \u3011 \n  * \u301053\u2020 Pull requests \u3011 \n  * \u301054\u2020 Actions \u3011 \n  * \u301055\u2020 Projects \u3011 \n  * \u301056\u2020 Security \u3011 \n  * \u301057\u2020 Insights \u3011 \n\n# bsab/Alexa-AI-Skill\n\nThis commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.\n\n\u00a0main\n\n\u301049\u2020Branches\u3011\u301050\u2020Tags\u3011\n\nGo to file \n\nCode\n\n## Folders and files \n\nName Name \n\nLast commit message \n\nLast commit date   \n\n## Latest commit\n\n## History\n\n\u301058\u20205 Commits\u3011  \n\n\u301059\u2020images\u3011\n\n\u301059\u2020images\u3011\n\n\u301060\u2020lambda\u3011\n\n\u301060\u2020lambda\u3011\n\n\u301061\u2020models\u3011\n\n\u301061\u2020models\u3011\n\n\u301062\u2020.gitignore\u3011\n\n\u301062\u2020.gitignore\u3011\n\n\u301046\u2020LICENSE\u3011\n\n\u301046\u2020LICENSE\u3011\n\n\u301063\u2020README.md\u3011\n\n\u301063\u2020README.md\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020ask-resources.json\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020ask-resources.json\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020json_editor.json\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020json_editor.json\u3011\n\n\u301066\u2020skill.json\u3011\n\n\u301066\u2020skill.json\u3011\n\nView all files   \n\n## Repository files navigation \n\n  * README \n  * MIT license \n\n# Alexa AI\n\n[Image 0: License: MIT]\n\nAzure OpenAI GPT-4.0 will be integrated, and the project is Alexa AI: Boost your Alexa by enhancing its responses.

You can set it up by modifying the existing code to include your OpenAI API key. The repository provides all the necessary components to get started with creating an Alexa Skill that can leverage OpenAI\u2019s responses. You can find more about this project [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Joao208/alexa-chatgpt)\u301089\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **bsab/Alexa-AI-Skill**: This repository demonstrates how to build an Alexa skill that uses OpenAI\u2019s GPT models. It includes step-by-step instructions on setting up the skill in the Alexa Developer Console and integrating OpenAI API calls within the lambda function. You just need to plug in your API key and follow the setup process. Check out the repository [here](https://github.com/k4l1sh/alexa-gpt)\u301090\u2020source\u3011.\n\nBoth of these solutions provide templates where you can just insert your OpenAI API key and deploy the Alexa skill using the Amazon Skills Kit (ASK).

Then, these responses are transmitted back to Alexa and presented to the user.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI to use the ChatGPT model. More information on how to do this can be found in the OpenAI API documentation.\n\nOnce you have your API key, simply insert it into the index.js file in the designated location.\n\n## Running the example\n\nThis example was developed using Amazon&#x27;s ASK CLI. To run it, you will need to install the ASK CLI and configure your Amazon Developer account.\n\nOnce configured, simply run the following commands in the terminal:\n\n    ask init\n    ask deploy\n\nThis will deploy your Skill to your Amazon Developer account and make it available for use with Alexa.\n\n## Final considerations\n\nThis is just a basic example of how to use ChatGPT with Alexa. You can expand this implementation to create more complex and personalized skills. Enjoy!\n\n## About\n\nThis is an Alexa bot developed with the help of OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT language model. With it, you can converse naturally with Alexa, answering questions and performing tasks based on its language training. \n\n\u301046\u2020bit.ly/3wUKdIz\u2020bit.ly\u3011 \n\n### Topics\n\n\u301067\u2020 javascript \u3011 \u301068\u2020 chat \u3011 \u301069\u2020 alexa \u3011 \u301070\u2020 axios \u3011 \u301071\u2020 chat-gpt \u3011 \n\n### Resources\n\nReadme \n\n\u301051\u2020 Activity \u3011 \n\n### Stars\n\n\u301047\u2020 190 stars \u3011 \n\n### Watchers\n\n\u301072\u2020 7 watching \u3011 \n\n### Forks\n\n\u301048\u2020 48 forks \u3011 \n\n\u301073\u2020 Report repository \u3011 \n\n##  \u301074\u2020 Releases \u3011\n\nNo releases published\n\n##  \u301075\u2020 Packages 0 \u3011\n\nNo packages published   \n\n##  \u301076\u2020 Contributors 2 \u3011\n\n  * \u301043\u2020 \u3011  \u30104", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 89, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 969, "end_ix": 980, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "GitHub - bsab/Alexa-AI-Skill", "url": "https://github.com/bsab/Alexa-AI-Skill", "text": "  * \u301053\u2020 Pull requests 0 \u3011\n  * \u301054\u2020 Actions \u3011\n  * \u301055\u2020 Projects 0 \u3011\n  * \u301056\u2020 Security \u3011\n  * \u301057\u2020 Insights \u3011\n\n  Additional navigation options  \n\n  * \u301044\u2020 Code \u3011 \n  * \u301052\u2020 Issues \u3011 \n  * \u301053\u2020 Pull requests \u3011 \n  * \u301054\u2020 Actions \u3011 \n  * \u301055\u2020 Projects \u3011 \n  * \u301056\u2020 Security \u3011 \n  * \u301057\u2020 Insights \u3011 \n\n# bsab/Alexa-AI-Skill\n\nThis commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.\n\n\u00a0main\n\n\u301049\u2020Branches\u3011\u301050\u2020Tags\u3011\n\nGo to file \n\nCode\n\n## Folders and files \n\nName Name \n\nLast commit message \n\nLast commit date   \n\n## Latest commit\n\n## History\n\n\u301058\u20205 Commits\u3011  \n\n\u301059\u2020images\u3011\n\n\u301059\u2020images\u3011\n\n\u301060\u2020lambda\u3011\n\n\u301060\u2020lambda\u3011\n\n\u301061\u2020models\u3011\n\n\u301061\u2020models\u3011\n\n\u301062\u2020.gitignore\u3011\n\n\u301062\u2020.gitignore\u3011\n\n\u301046\u2020LICENSE\u3011\n\n\u301046\u2020LICENSE\u3011\n\n\u301063\u2020README.md\u3011\n\n\u301063\u2020README.md\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020ask-resources.json\u3011\n\n\u301064\u2020ask-resources.json\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020json_editor.json\u3011\n\n\u301065\u2020json_editor.json\u3011\n\n\u301066\u2020skill.json\u3011\n\n\u301066\u2020skill.json\u3011\n\nView all files   \n\n## Repository files navigation \n\n  * README \n  * MIT license \n\n# Alexa AI\n\n[Image 0: License: MIT]\n\nAzure OpenAI GPT-4.0 will be integrated, and the project is Alexa AI: Boost your Alexa by enhancing its responses.

Then, these responses are transmitted back to Alexa and presented to the user.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI to use the ChatGPT model. More information on how to do this can be found in the OpenAI API documentation.\n\nOnce you have your API key, simply insert it into the index.js file in the designated location.\n\n## Running the example\n\nThis example was developed using Amazon&#x27;s ASK CLI. To run it, you will need to install the ASK CLI and configure your Amazon Developer account.\n\nOnce configured, simply run the following commands in the terminal:\n\n    ask init\n    ask deploy\n\nThis will deploy your Skill to your Amazon Developer account and make it available for use with Alexa.\n\n## Final considerations\n\nThis is just a basic example of how to use ChatGPT with Alexa. You can expand this implementation to create more complex and personalized skills. Enjoy!\n\n## About\n\nThis is an Alexa bot developed with the help of OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT language model.

These licenses often allow modification and even commercialization, but with certain conditions. For example:\n   - **MIT License**: This is very permissive and typically allows for commercial use, provided that you include the original copyright notice and license in your project.\n   - **GPL**: This requires that if you modify and distribute the software, you must also open-source your version under the same license.\n\n   **What to do**: Check the repository&#x27;s license (which is usually included in the project) to ensure you comply with its terms before monetizing anything based on it.\n\n### 2. **Attribution**:  \nIn some cases, even if monetization is allowed, you are required to give proper credit to the original creator. Failing to do so can be seen as dishonest or shady. Be transparent about the use of open-source code and clearly state your modifications or contributions if you are selling or monetizing the skill.\n\n### 3. **Ethical Considerations**:  \nUsing someone else\u2019s open-source work for commercial gain without adding substantial value or giving credit can be perceived as taking advantage of the community. It&#x27;s important to ask yourself:\n   - Are you adding unique value to the product, or is it just a repackaged version of someone else&#x27;s work?\n   - Would the original author approve of your monetization efforts?\n\n   If you&#x27;re mostly using the open-source work without significant changes, it\u2019s more ethical to either refrain from monetizing or to contribute back to the project (e.g., through donations, code contributions, or support).\n\n### 4. **User Expectations**:  \nIf you charge users for a skill, they will expect high reliability, support, and ongoing updates. If the core functionality relies on a third-party open-source project, you\u2019ll need to ensure that it\u2019s stable and properly supported. Otherwise, users may see this as shady or a ripoff if issues arise, especially if they find out it\u2019s built on open-source software.\n\n### 5. **Reputational Risk**:  \nWhile not necessarily dishonest, monetizing something that heavily relies on open-source contributions can give the impression of being opportunistic if not handled transparently. However, if you build upon the open-source code, add significant improvements, and provide value beyond what\u2019s already freely available, this risk is mitigated.\n\n### Final Thought:\nMonetizing your Alexa skill can be done ethically as long as you:\n   - Follow the license terms.\n   - Give credit where it\u2019s due.\n   - Provide value beyond what the open-source project offers.\n   - Ensure users know what they\u2019re paying for.\n\nIf you handle it transparently and add value, there\u2019s no reason why it would be considered shady.

The ASK CLI lets you manage your Alexa skills. \n   - To install ASK CLI, run the following command in your terminal:\n     ```bash\n     npm install -g ask-cli\n     ```\n\n2. **Clone the Repository**:\n   - Go to the GitHub repository page [Joao208/alexa-chatgpt](https://github.com/Joao208/alexa-chatgpt) and click on the **Code** button.\n   - Copy the URL from the HTTPS or SSH section.\n   - In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, then run the following command:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/Joao208/alexa-chatgpt.git\n     ```\n   - This will download the repository onto your local machine.\n\n3. **Open the Project Folder**:\n   - Navigate to the downloaded project directory:\n     ```bash\n     cd alexa-chatgpt\n     ```\n\n4. **Open the `index.js` File**:\n   - In this project folder, find the `index.js` file, which contains the core logic for the Alexa skill.\n   - You\u2019ll need to modify this file to include your OpenAI API key.\n   - Open the file in any text editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.) and look for the section where you should input your OpenAI API key (usually something like `const openAiApiKey = &#x27;YOUR_API_KEY&#x27;;`).\n   - Replace `&#x27;YOUR_API_KEY&#x27;` with your actual OpenAI API key.\n\n5. **Update Dependencies**:\n   - Install the required dependencies for the project by running:\n     ```bash\n     npm install\n     ```\n\n6. **Configure ASK CLI**:\n   - Run the following command to initialize ASK CLI:\n     ```bash\n     ask init\n     ```\n   - Follow the on-screen prompts to authenticate and configure your Amazon developer account.\n\n7. **Deploy the Skill**:\n   - Once everything is set up, you can deploy the skill to your Amazon Developer account by running:\n     ```bash\n     ask deploy\n     ```\n\n8. **Test the Skill**:\n   - After deploying, you can test your skill using the Alexa developer console or any Alexa-enabled device.\n   - You can also test it locally by using the `local-debugger.js` file provided in the repository. You\u2019ll need to set up a local debugging environment using Node.js.\n\n9. **Modify and Expand the Skill (Optional)**:\n   - The project you\u2019ve cloned is a basic template for Alexa to interact with ChatGPT. You can modify or expand the skill by adding new features, personalizing the responses, or even monetizing the skill through Alexa\u2019s in-skill purchasing.\n\n10. **Monitoring and Logs**:\n    - To ensure that your skill is working properly, monitor the logs using CloudWatch, which will give you insights into how the skill is performing or if there are any errors during execution.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed these steps, your Alexa skill integrated with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT will be live and ready to use!\n\nLet me know if you need clarification on any specific step!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

If you can see `node.exe` and `npm.cmd` in this folder, it means Node.js was installed but isn&#x27;t recognized yet.\n\n2. **Add Node.js to PATH**:\n    - If Node.js is installed but the command isn\u2019t recognized, it could be due to the PATH variable not being set up correctly.\n    - To add Node.js and npm to your system\u2019s PATH:\n      - Right-click on **This PC** or **My Computer**, and select **Properties**.\n      - Click **Advanced System Settings** on the left panel.\n      - Under the **Advanced** tab, click **Environment Variables**.\n      - Under **System Variables**, find the `Path` variable, select it, and click **Edit**.\n      - Click **New** and add this path: `C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\`.\n      - Click **OK** to close the windows.\n    \n3. **Restart PowerShell or Command Prompt** and test if the commands work:\n    - Run `node -v` to check the Node.js version.\n    - Run `npm -v` to check the npm version.\n\n### 2. Reinstall Node.js (if necessary)\nIf Node.js is not present in the expected folder or the PATH adjustments didn&#x27;t fix the issue, try reinstalling Node.js.\n\n- Download Node.js again from the official website: [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/).\n- Follow the installation process and make sure the checkbox for installing npm and the necessary tools (like Chocolatey) is checked.\n- Restart PowerShell or Command Prompt and try running `node -v` and `npm -v` again.\n\n### 3. Continue with ASK-CLI\nOnce `node -v` and `npm -v` return the correct version numbers, you can proceed with installing the ASK CLI by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g ask-cli\n```\n\nLet me know if any of these steps still present issues, and we can troubleshoot further!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/Joao208/alexa-chatgpt.git\n   ```\n\n   Then navigate into the project directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd alexa-chatgpt\n   ```\n\n### 3. **Insert Your OpenAI API Key**\n   Open the `index.js` file in the project directory. This is where you&#x27;ll add your OpenAI API key.\n\n   - Find the line where it mentions the API key in the `index.js` file (likely where the ChatGPT API is called) and replace it with your OpenAI API key.\n   - Save the file after adding the key.\n\n### 4. **Deploy Your Skill**\n   Once you&#x27;ve added your OpenAI API key, deploy the skill using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   ask deploy\n   ```\n\n   This will push your skill to the Alexa Developer Console and set up the necessary Lambda functions.\n\n### 5. **Test the Skill**\n   After deployment, you can test the skill through the Alexa Developer Console or on your Alexa device. You can also simulate requests with:\n\n   ```bash\n   ask simulate\n   ```\n\n   Example of testing the skill with a sample phrase:\n\n   ```bash\n   ask simulate --text &quot;Ask my ChatGPT skill how the weather is&quot; --locale &quot;en-US&quot;\n   ```\n\nThis will allow you to see the responses Alexa will give for the skill you&#x27;ve created.\n\nOnce you&#x27;ve successfully deployed and tested it, you&#x27;re ready to refine or expand the functionality further!

You can manually create it using the following steps:\n   \n   - Navigate to `C:\\Users\\alexi` in your file explorer.\n   - Create a new folder named `.ask`.\n   - Inside that folder, create a new file called `cli_config`.\n\n   The content of this file can be simple and looks like this:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n      &quot;profiles&quot;: {\n         &quot;default&quot;: {\n            &quot;aws_profile&quot;: &quot;default&quot;\n         }\n      }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Save this file and retry the `ask init` command.\n\n### 2. **Check File Permissions**\n   If the folder exists but the file couldn\u2019t be created, make sure you have the correct permissions to write in the `C:\\Users\\alexi` directory. You might want to run the terminal as an administrator or manually verify your write permissions for that folder.\n\n### 3. **Alternative Method - Reinitialize via Login**\n   If the above steps don&#x27;t work, you could try manually configuring the Alexa CLI via login. First, run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   ask configure\n   ```\n\n   This will prompt you to log in to your Amazon Developer account and set up the necessary files, bypassing the need for the missing `cli_config` file.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done this, try running `ask init` again.

Now that you&#x27;re on Glitch, let&#x27;s get your Alexa Skill running there. Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide to follow:\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Project\n1. Go to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).\n2. On the homepage, click **&quot;New Project&quot;**.\n3. Select **&quot;Create a Node App&quot;** since your Alexa Skill will use Node.js to communicate with the OpenAI API.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Your Project Environment\n1. Once the project is created, you&#x27;ll see some files like `package.json`, `server.js`, etc.\n2. Rename **`server.js`** to **`index.js`**, as that&#x27;s where you will place your code.\n3. Open the **`package.json`** file, and add any necessary dependencies. You will need `axios` to make HTTP requests to OpenAI&#x27;s API. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     &quot;name&quot;: &quot;alexa-chatgpt&quot;,\n     &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,\n     &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Alexa Skill powered by OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT&quot;,\n     &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,\n     &quot;scripts&quot;: {\n       &quot;start&quot;: &quot;node index.js&quot;\n     },\n     &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n       &quot;express&quot;: &quot;^4.17.1&quot;,\n       &quot;axios&quot;: &quot;^0.21.1&quot;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. After you modify `package.json`, Glitch will automatically install the necessary dependencies.\n\n### Step 3: Write the Alexa Skill Code\n1. In **`index.js`**, write the basic Express server setup:\n\n   ```js\n   const express = require(&#x27;express&#x27;);\n   const axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n   const app = express();\n\n   app.use(express.json());\n\n   app.post(&#x27;/alexa&#x27;, async (req, res) =&gt; {\n       const alexaRequest = req.body;\n       const userQuery = alexaRequest.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n\n       try {\n           // Make a request to OpenAI API\n           const openAIResponse = await axios.post(\n               &#x27;https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions&#x27;,\n               {\n                   model: &quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;,\n                   messages: [{ role: &quot;user&quot;, content: userQuery }]\n               },\n               {\n                   headers: {\n                       &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`,\n                       &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;\n                   }\n               }\n           );\n\n           const aiResponse = openAIResponse.data.choices[0].message.content;\n\n           // Construct a response for Alexa\n           res.json({\n               version: &#x27;1.0&#x27;,\n               response: {\n                   outputSpeech: {\n                       type: &#x27;PlainText&#x27;,\n                       text: aiResponse,\n                   },\n                   shouldEndSession: true,\n               }\n           });\n       } catch (error) {\n           console.error(error);\n           res.status(500).json({ error: &quot;Something went wrong&quot; });\n       }\n   });\n\n   // Start the server\n   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n   app.listen(PORT, () =&gt; {\n       console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. Replace **`YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`** with your actual OpenAI API key.\n\n### Step 4: Configure Alexa to Use Your Glitch App\n1. Once the code is working, click **&quot;Share&quot;** in the Glitch project and copy the live link (the URL that ends with `glitch.me`).\n2. Go to the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) and set up a new Alexa Skill.\n3. In the **&quot;Endpoint&quot;** section of the Alexa Developer Console, paste the **Glitch URL** followed by `/alexa` (e.g., `https://yourprojectname.glitch.me/alexa`).\n\n### Step 5: Test Your Alexa Skill\n1. Use the Alexa Developer Console to test the skill by typing or speaking a request to Alexa.\n2. Your Glitch server will receive the request, process it with OpenAI, and return the response to Alexa.\n\n### Step 6: Make Sure the Server Keeps Running\nTo ensure the server doesn&#x27;t go to sleep, you may want to set up a ping service like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to periodically ping your Glitch URL.\n\nLet me know if you need help with any of these steps!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s how to proceed:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Using Glitch for Your Alexa Skill\n\n1. **Create a Project on Glitch**:\n   - Go to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).\n   - Create a new project by clicking on \u201cNew Project\u201d and choosing a template, such as the &quot;Hello Node&quot; project.\n   - This will give you a basic Node.js server, which you can edit for your Alexa skill.\n\n2. **Clone or Fork the GitHub Repository**:\n   - Go to the GitHub repository (such as the one you were initially using), copy the code, and paste it into the relevant sections of your Glitch project.\n   - Alternatively, you can &quot;Import from GitHub&quot; directly in Glitch if you&#x27;re more comfortable using GitHub for version control.\n\n3. **Set Up the OpenAI API**:\n   - Open the `index.js` or any relevant file in the project. Here, you will need to insert your **OpenAI API key**.\n   - You can replace any placeholder keys with your real OpenAI API key, which you should have already set up in earlier steps.\n   - The OpenAI key usually goes in a part of the code that interacts with the API (e.g., using the `axios` library or another HTTP request package).\n\n4. **Configure the Alexa Skill Interaction**:\n   - Ensure that the code handles incoming Alexa requests correctly. In the file handling the Alexa skill&#x27;s logic (usually `index.js` or similar), make sure it sends the response from ChatGPT back to the Alexa device.\n   - You\u2019ll also want to check that the request format Alexa sends matches what your server expects. Adjust as needed to ensure smooth communication.\n\n5. **Deploy Your Glitch Project**:\n   - Once the code is ready and you&#x27;ve saved the project, it will automatically be live with a public URL. This URL will act as your skill&#x27;s endpoint.\n   - You can find this URL by clicking on &quot;Share&quot; and copying the live app URL. It will look something like `https://&lt;project-name&gt;.glitch.me`.\n\n6. **Set Up Your Alexa Developer Console**:\n   - Go to the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).\n   - Create a new skill or edit your existing one.\n   - Under **Endpoint**, provide the public URL from Glitch.\n   - Make sure you select **HTTPS** for the endpoint and check that it\u2019s properly secured (Glitch URLs are HTTPS by default).\n\n7. **Test the Skill**:\n   - Use the Alexa Developer Console\u2019s built-in tools or your own Alexa device to test the skill.\n   - Make sure that when you ask Alexa a question, it hits your Glitch endpoint, sends a request to OpenAI\u2019s API, and reads the response back to you.\n\n### Final Considerations\n- **Debugging**: If things aren\u2019t working as expected, use the **Alexa Developer Console logs** and **Glitch\u2019s logs** (available under the \u201cLogs\u201d tab on the Glitch project) to troubleshoot.\n- **Enhancing**: Once the core functionality works, you can enhance it by adding more complex responses, email integration, or even monetizing the skill via Alexa\u2019s developer tools.\n\nThis approach allows you to avoid AWS entirely, while still developing a custom Alexa skill that integrates with ChatGPT.

Here\u2019s an example:\n     ```json\n     {\n       &quot;name&quot;: &quot;alexa-chatgpt&quot;,\n       &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,\n       &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Alexa skill with ChatGPT integration&quot;,\n       &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n         &quot;ask-sdk-core&quot;: &quot;^2.10.0&quot;,\n         &quot;ask-sdk-model&quot;: &quot;^1.25.0&quot;,\n         &quot;axios&quot;: &quot;^0.21.1&quot;\n       },\n       &quot;engines&quot;: {\n         &quot;node&quot;: &quot;14.x&quot;\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Write server-side logic**:\n   - In `server.js`, use the OpenAI and Alexa SDKs to create your logic.\n   - An example of server code to handle Alexa intents and route them to OpenAI API might look like this:\n     ```javascript\n     const Alexa = require(&#x27;ask-sdk-core&#x27;);\n     const axios = require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);\n\n     const getOpenAIResponse = async (userQuery) =&gt; {\n       const response = await axios.post(&#x27;https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions&#x27;, {\n         prompt: userQuery,\n         max_tokens: 150\n       }, {\n         headers: {\n           &#x27;Authorization&#x27;: `Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`\n         }\n       });\n       return response.data.choices[0].text;\n     };\n\n     const LaunchRequestHandler = {\n       canHandle(handlerInput) {\n         return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;LaunchRequest&#x27;;\n       },\n       async handle(handlerInput) {\n         const speakOutput = &#x27;Welcome to your ChatGPT Alexa skill!&#x27;;\n         return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n           .speak(speakOutput)\n           .getResponse();\n       }\n     };\n\n     const OpenAIIntentHandler = {\n       canHandle(handlerInput) {\n         return Alexa.getRequestType(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;IntentRequest&#x27;\n           &amp;&amp; Alexa.getIntentName(handlerInput.requestEnvelope) === &#x27;GetAIResponseIntent&#x27;;\n       },\n       async handle(handlerInput) {\n         const query = handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.intent.slots.query.value;\n         const response = await getOpenAIResponse(query);\n         return handlerInput.responseBuilder\n           .speak(response)\n           .getResponse();\n       }\n     };\n\n     const skillBuilder = Alexa.SkillBuilders.custom();\n\n     exports.handler = skillBuilder\n       .addRequestHandlers(\n         LaunchRequestHandler,\n         OpenAIIntentHandler\n       )\n       .lambda();\n     ```\n\n4. **Set your OpenAI API key**:\n   - In the `.env` file, store your OpenAI API key:\n     ```\n     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here\n     ```\n\n5. **Run your project**:\n   - Once the code is written, you can test it directly on Glitch.\n   - Click on `Tools` at the bottom and select `Logs` to see how the app behaves and if any errors pop up.\n\n6. **Connect with Alexa**:\n   - You can now use Glitch&#x27;s public URL (found in the `Share` button) as the backend for your Alexa skill by adding this URL in the endpoint section when configuring your Alexa skill in the Amazon Developer Console.\n\nLet me know how it goes or if you have any questions!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

You can add it like this:\n      ```\n      OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key\n      ```\n    - Make sure you replace `your-api-key` with your actual API key from OpenAI.\n\n3. **Run the Project**: After configuring the `.env` file, ensure the app is running smoothly by checking the **Logs** section. If there are no issues, you can try sending some test requests to see if everything works.\n\n4. **Test It Live**: \n   - Once the project is set up, you can preview the project using the **Show** option in Glitch. \n   - From here, you should be able to test your custom Alexa ChatGPT skill.\n\n5. **Deploy on Alexa**: You can continue to follow the instructions on configuring your Alexa skill using ASK-CLI, but in Glitch, the main focus is on ensuring the backend logic is functioning smoothly with OpenAI before linking it to Alexa.\n\nIf you need any specific help with any step, let me know!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It seems like there&#x27;s an extra `}` at the end. Here\u2019s the correct syntax:\n\n```javascript\nAuthorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,\n```\n\nNotice the removal of the extra curly brace `}`.\n\n### 2. **Check your `askToGPT` function for API endpoint**:\nMake sure you\u2019re using the correct endpoint for the OpenAI GPT-3 model. If you&#x27;re using GPT-4, for example, the engine or model name might be different. Ensure your OpenAI account has the correct API access for the engine you&#x27;re using.\n\n### 3. **Ensure OpenAI API key is properly stored**\nMake sure your `.env` file in Glitch is correctly set up with your OpenAI API key:\n```\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here\n```\n\n### 4. **Improve Error Handling**\nConsider adding better error handling to your `askToGPT` function in case the OpenAI API request fails. For example:\n\n```javascript\nasync function askToGPT(prompt) {\n  try {\n    const response = await axios.post(\n      &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-003/completions&quot;,\n      {\n        prompt,\n        max_tokens: 100,\n        n: 1,\n        temperature: 0.5,\n        stop: &quot;.&quot;,\n        top_p: 1,\n      },\n      {\n        headers: {\n          &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;,\n          Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,\n        },\n      }\n    );\n\n    return response.data.choices[0].text;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(&quot;Error calling GPT:&quot;, error);\n    return &quot;Sorry, something went wrong while contacting GPT.&quot;;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **General Checks**\n- Make sure that your Alexa skill is correctly configured with the necessary intents in the Alexa Developer Console. For example, the `AskToGPTIntent` must be defined with a slot for `question`.\n  \n- Ensure the Alexa Skill is able to correctly communicate with your hosted Glitch project by configuring the endpoint in your Alexa Developer Console to point to your Glitch app\u2019s URL.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done these things, you should be in a good position to test the skill!

The error indicates that there might be some incompatibility or issue with how Node.js is interpreting the code.\n\nHere\u2019s what to try next:\n\n1. **Check the Axios import**: It should be using `require`, which you&#x27;ve already done. So you&#x27;re fine there:\n   ```js\n   const axios = require(&quot;axios&quot;);\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Node.js version**: It seems that Node.js might be running an outdated version on Glitch. Axios uses modern JavaScript syntax, and if the Node version on Glitch is too old, this might be causing the problem. Glitch sometimes defaults to older Node.js versions.\n\n   - Go to your `package.json` file.\n   - Add the following to specify a more recent Node version (e.g., 16.x or later):\n\n     ```json\n     &quot;engines&quot;: {\n       &quot;node&quot;: &quot;16.x&quot;\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - Then try running `npm install` again and restart your project.\n\n3. **Check the `package.json` file for dependencies**: Ensure `axios` is listed under the dependencies in `package.json`:\n\n   ```json\n   &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n     &quot;axios&quot;: &quot;^1.3.2&quot;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **If this doesn&#x27;t work, try clearing the npm cache**: Sometimes package conflicts can persist. You can clear the npm cache with:\n   ```bash\n   npm cache clean --force\n   ```\n\n5. **Final option: Try switching to `require` for everything**: If you&#x27;re running into issues with the environment recognizing `import`, stick with `require` throughout your code.\n\nIf after these steps the issue persists, you can also try checking your project&#x27;s logs for more detailed error information by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nLet me know if these steps help or if further assistance is needed!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide on how to simulate requests and test your skill:\n\n### Steps to Simulate an Alexa Request:\n\n1. **Sign In to the Alexa Developer Console**:\n   - Go to the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).\n   - Sign in with your Amazon account.\n\n2. **Select Your Skill**:\n   - Once you are logged in, navigate to the **Skills** tab in the console.\n   - Select the skill you want to test (which should be the one you&#x27;re developing with the Alexa-GPT integration).\n\n3. **Navigate to the Test Tab**:\n   - In the skill dashboard, click on the **Test** tab at the top.\n   - Ensure that the skill is in **Development** mode. You can switch to **Development** by toggling the switch to **Enabled**.\n\n4. **Enter Utterances**:\n   - In the **Test** tab, under **Alexa Simulator**, you can simulate user requests.\n   - In the text box where it says &quot;Enter Utterance,&quot; type in the request you want to test (e.g., &quot;Ask GPT, what is the capital of France?&quot;).\n   - You can also test your invocation name (e.g., &quot;Open [Your Skill Name]&quot;) to start the skill.\n\n5. **Monitor the Responses**:\n   - After typing your utterance, Alexa will simulate the response. You\u2019ll see both the text and voice response Alexa would give.\n   - If your skill makes an external API request (such as to GPT-4 via OpenAI), ensure that it is working correctly and returning the expected output.\n\n6. **Test with Voice**:\n   - You can also simulate voice input by clicking the **Microphone** button and speaking the utterance you want to test.\n\n7. **View JSON Input and Output**:\n   - If you want to see the detailed request/response interaction, scroll down to view the **JSON Input** (what Alexa sends to your skill) and **JSON Output** (what your skill returns to Alexa). This can help in debugging or verifying the data flow.\n\n8. **Review Logs** (Optional):\n   - If you&#x27;re using Glitch or another hosting platform, check the logs in your Glitch project for any errors or issues when handling the requests.\n\nOnce the skill works as expected in the Alexa Developer Console, you can also test it on your Alexa-enabled devices if the skill is enabled for your account.\n\nLet me know if you encounter any issues while testing!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s how you can do it:\n\n### Steps to Upload Code to Developer Console:\n\n1. **Open the Amazon Developer Console**:\n   - Log in to your [Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).\n\n2. **Create a New Alexa Skill**:\n   - In the console, click **Create Skill**.\n   - Name your skill, choose the default language, and select the **Custom** model.\n\n3. **Choose a Method for Hosting the Skill**:\n   - When asked about backend services, choose **Provision Your Own**.\n   - This allows you to upload your code manually via an AWS Lambda function or a custom endpoint.\n\n4. **Set Up an AWS Lambda Function (Optional)**:\n   - You can upload your skill to AWS Lambda if you want it to be hosted in the cloud.\n   - Set up a Lambda function in AWS, and you can paste the Node.js code there.\n   - Once done, copy the **Lambda ARN** and paste it into the Alexa Developer Console in the **Endpoint** section of your skill.\n\n5. **Upload Your Code**:\n   - Go to the **Code** section of your skill in the Developer Console.\n   - Here you can directly upload or link to the backend code. Since you\u2019ve been working in Node.js on Glitch, you can copy and paste that code into the appropriate place.\n\n6. **Add Your API Key**:\n   - Make sure your `.env` file or environment variables are set properly.\n   - Add your OpenAI API key and any other configurations to the Lambda function or server endpoint.\n\n7. **Test Your Skill**:\n   - In the **Test** section of the Developer Console, enable testing for your skill and simulate requests.\n   - You can input the text or voice commands you want Alexa to process.\n\n8. **Deploy the Skill**:\n   - Once testing works, you can submit the skill for certification to make it publicly available.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- **Long Response Time**: If your code takes more than 30 seconds to respond, as in the case of cloud timeout errors on Glitch, you may need to optimize or paginate the API requests to ensure Alexa doesn&#x27;t time out.\n- **Function Timeouts**: AWS Lambda functions have a default timeout of 3 seconds, but this can be extended up to 15 minutes (make sure to increase the timeout in the Lambda configuration if necessary).\n\nBy following these steps, you can move your Glitch-hosted code to the official Alexa platform, test it, and deploy it as a fully functional skill."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are steps you can take to verify your code:\n\n### 1. **Test API Calls Locally (Postman)**:\n   - Use **Postman** or a similar tool to send requests to your OpenAI API with the same format your Alexa skill would use.\n   - Check for proper responses from the GPT-4 API. This ensures that the API integration works before involving Alexa.\n\n### 2. **Local Simulation via Node.js**:\n   - Run your code locally by simulating a request.\n   - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.\n   - You can run your `index.js` locally with commands like `node index.js` to see if it throws any errors or returns the expected responses.\n\n### 3. **Using the Alexa Simulator**:\n   - In the **Alexa Developer Console**, you can create a bare-bones version of your skill without fully deploying it.\n   - Use the **Alexa Simulator** to test the voice interactions and see how the backend responds.\n   - You don\u2019t need to submit the skill for certification to test it.\n\n### 4. **Check Logs on Glitch or Lambda**:\n   - Ensure your code is free of errors by checking the logs in Glitch or AWS Lambda after running it.\n   - Glitch shows logs in the console, and Lambda logs are available via **CloudWatch**.\n   - This will help identify any runtime issues, such as missing environment variables or errors with axios requests.\n\n### 5. **Breakpoints/Debugging**:\n   - Use `console.log` statements to track where the request might be failing.\n   - For example, log the response from the GPT-4 API before sending it back to Alexa to ensure you\u2019re getting the expected output.\n\n### 6. **Time Out Issues**:\n   - If requests are taking longer than expected (like what happened in Postman), try to reduce the `max_tokens` in your OpenAI API call or optimize how you handle API responses.\n   - If the issue persists, it could be an issue with the environment (e.g., Glitch limitations), in which case deploying to Lambda might be better for response times.\n\nIf your code passes these tests without significant issues, it\u2019s more likely that it will work properly when moved to the Alexa Developer Console."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

When you want to bring your LLM-based experiences to life through expressive voice or ambient visuals, and distribute them to Alexa\u2019s devices, you will have the ability to integrate your Alexa Skill with one or more LLMs of your choice with a new tool. To integrate third-party LLMs, all you\u2019ll have to do is integrate with automatic speech recognition (ASR) or utterance text using a simple SDK that supports the entire range of multimodal experiences enabled by Alexa.\u00a0  \n\nWe\u2019re excited about the experiences being created by developers, and we\u2019ll have more to share soon from companies like Character.AI, Splash, BMW, Volley, Sleep Jar, Voice Apps, and OpenTable who are enabling customers to do things like talk to fictional characters, create their own songs, play\u00a0single and multi-agent driven games on Alexa-enabled devices, learn about the features of their vehicle and so much more.\u00a0  \n\nLeverage differentiated offerings for smart home developers  \n\nToday, customers have connected over 400 million smart home devices to Alexa. Our partners have been critical in helping build smart home experiences\u00a0with devices from all brands working seamlessly together to make customers\u2019 lives easier. We will be leveraging generative AI to allow customers to control their smart home devices for a variety of actions through flexible and natural conversations, which Alexa\u2019s LLM will map to the unique and differentiated features of their products. To cover the broadest set of use cases, we will be providing developers with a path for both common integrations such as on/off or start/stop actions, and more complex ones such as actions related to dynamic lighting or custom cleaning operations for a vacuum cleaner.  \n\nSmart home Generic Controller Interfaces such as our existing Alexa.RangeController and Alexa.ModeController remain a simple yet effective way to integrate devices with Alexa for common use cases. A new interface called Action Controller extends this further by enabling device makers to model simple actions, targets, and states to control their devices, giving customers the ability to interact naturally with their devices. This means customers using Alexa\u2019s LLM can say \u201cAlexa, the floor is dirty,\u201d and Alexa will be able to infer the intended action is \u2018vacuum\u2019, and state \u2018start.\u2019 Action Controller makes it simple for device makers to model new supported actions and targets. To take advantage of Action Controller, you need to 1) define your supported device actions such as clean, mop, or dock 2) define a list of targets such as \u2018kitchen\u2019 or \u2018living room,\u2019 3) choose the state(s) to support (choose one or more actions from start/stop/pause/resume) and 4) implement the required directive and state updates when Alexa sends the requested actions to your skills.\n\nBelow is an example of a multi-functional device modeled using the Action Controller instance. In this example, the device supports cleaning type actions (such as \u2018vacuum,\u2019) a list of target zones and device action states (start/stop/pause/resume.)\u00a0\n\n\u2398Copy code Copied to clipboard\n\n    { &quot;capabilities&quot;: [{\n        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;AlexaInterface&quot;,\n        &quot;interface&quot;: &quot;Alexa.ActionController&quot;,\n        &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;Robot.Clean&quot;,\n        &quot;configuration&quot;: {\n            &quot;supportedActions&quot;: [{ //An identifier device maker defined for the actions reported.\n                &quot;id&quot;: &quot;Vacuum-device-maker-defined-identifier&quot;,\n                &quot;friendlyNames&quot;: [{\n                    &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;asset&quot;,\n                    &quot;value&quot;: {\n                      &quot;assetId&quot;: &quot;Alexa.Actions.Vacuum&quot;\n            }}]}],\n            &quot;supportedStates&quot;: [\n              &quot;START&quot;,\n              &quot;STOP&quot;,\n              &quot;PAUSE&quot;,\n              &quot;RESUME&quot;\n            ],\n            &quot;target&quot;: {\n              &quot;supportedTargets&quot;: [{ //A list of identifiers device maker defined for the targets reported\n                 &quot;id&quot;: &quot;space-id-1&quot;,\n                 &quot;friendlyNames&quot;: [\n                  {\n                    &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;asset&quot;,\n                    &quot;value&quot;: {\n                    &quot;assetId&quot;: &quot;Alexa.Space.Kitchen&quot;\n    }}]}]}}}]}\n\nBelow is the example of the directive a device maker will receive for the start action:\n\n\u2398Copy code Copied to clipboard\n\n    {\n      &quot;directive&quot;: {\n      &quot;header&quot;: {\n      &quot;namespace&quot;: &quot;Alexa.ActionController&quot;,\n      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;Robot.Clean&quot;,\n      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;PerformAction&quot;,\n      &quot;messageId&quot;: &quot;message id&quot;,\n      }\n      &quot;payload&quot;: {\n      &quot;actionId&quot;: &quot;Vacuum-device-maker-defined-identifier&quot;,\n      &quot;targetIds&quot;: [&quot;&lt;the target identifier&gt;&quot;],\n      &quot;state&quot;: &quot;START&quot;\n      }}}\n\nFor device control beyond a simple action, more complex device states, or parameters, we are introducing Dynamic Controller, a new tool allowing developers to define a custom interface. Dynamic Controller enables customers to use a wider range of utterances to control the unique features of their smart home devices in a more conversational way (e.g. a customer can request a lighting solution provider to \u201cmake the lights like a misty forest\u201d \u2013 in the past they would only have been able to select from a list of predefined options).

This new integration model allows you to build experiences that enable customers\u00a0to participate in multi-turn, cross-skill conversations. For example, a customer planning a trip might ask about the best time of year to visit, places to see, and hotel reservations in the same conversation. To fulfill this task, relevant APIs will be called based on the API definitions and descriptions provided by you. As Alexa orchestrates and chains together intermediate natural language reasoning steps, it decomposes complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, and constructs the response to the customer. Alexa is able to complete these complex tasks in real time in line with customer expectations for voice interactions.\n\nWe have also enhanced our Skill manifest with an increased number of configuration fields to build LLM-based experiences.\u00a0\n\nmodelFacingName\u00a0and\u00a0modelFacingDescription\u00a0fields are used by the model to understand the functionality the Alexa Skill provides.\u00a0actionProvider\u00a0enables a new type of integration for integrating APIs with Alexa.\u00a0\n\n\u2398Copy code Copied to clipboard\n\n    {\n        &quot;manifest&quot;: {\n            &quot;modelFacingName&quot;: &quot;Restaurant Reservations&quot;,\n            &quot;modelFacingDescription&quot;: &quot;Use this to book restaurant reservations&quot;,\n            &quot;publishingInformation&quot;: {\n              // same as before\n            },\n            &quot;apis&quot;: {\n                &quot;actionProvider&quot;: {\n                    &quot;endpoint&quot;: { \n                        &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:452493640596:function:restaurantReservationsHandler&quot;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nTo make it simpler for developers to author and maintain API specifications and logic, we will support API declarations using our SDKs for the most common interface languages, starting with TypeScript.\u00a0\n\n\u2398Copy code Copied to clipboard\n\n    @Service\n    export class RestaurantReservationService {\n      @Description(&quot;Use this method to find restaurants by the zipCode&quot;)\n      public findRestaurants(zipCode: string) : Promise&lt;Restaurant&gt; {\n        // restaurant search logic\n      }\n\n      @Description(&quot;Use this to reserve a restaurant, confirm with the user before reserving&quot;)\n      public reserveRestaurant(restaurant: Restaurant, partySize: number, date: string): Promise&lt;string&gt; {\n        // reservation logic \n      }\n    }\n\n    @Description(&quot;Restaurant schema&quot;)\n    export interface Restaurant {\n        restaurantId: string;\n        name: string;\n        address: string;\n        address2: string;\n        city: string;\n        state: string;\n        country: string;\n    }\n\nConnect your content with Alexa\u2019s LLM\u00a0\n\nYou will also be able to build content-driven, ambient experiences and deliver them to over half a billion Alexa-enabled devices. You can use unstructured data like product manuals or websites, or structured data from existing databases to enable customers to find the perfect show on Prime Video, get summaries of earnings reports, access recipes from an expert chef and more. These experiences will be powered by techniques such as retrieval augmented generation without needing to train core LLM models on your data.\u00a0  \n\nTo integrate content, create a content spec that includes 1) a short natural language description of the content (e.g., FAQs on amenities and guest services) 2) instructions on the desired use-cases to support and 3) the unstructured content or structured data, and ingest them using our new tools. These tools include managed instances of vector databases, which eliminate the need for you to provision and maintain your own services. When a customer asks for information related to your content, Alexa searches the content store, and forms a response using the most relevant information.\n\n\u2398Copy code Copied to clipboard\n\n    {\n        &quot;manifest&quot;: {\n            &quot;modelFacingName&quot;: &quot;Food Recipes&quot;,\n            &quot;modelFacingDescription&quot;: &quot;Use this to find food recipes.&quot;,\n            &quot;publishingInformation&quot;: {\n              // same as before\n            },\n            &quot;apis&quot;: {\n                &quot;contentProvider&quot;: {\n                    &quot;sources&quot;: [\n                        {\n                            &quot;location&quot;: &quot;skillpackage://content/food-recipes.pdf&quot;\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nConnect your own LLM with Alexa devices and experiences\n\nIn addition, we understand that you may have already purpose-built your own LLMs or leveraged LLMs offered through services like Amazon Bedrock. When you want to bring your LLM-based experiences to life through expressive voice or ambient visuals, and distribute them to Alexa\u2019s devices, you will have the ability to integrate your Alexa Skill with one or more LLMs of your choice with a new tool. To integrate third-party LLMs, all you\u2019ll have to do is integrate with automatic speech recognition (ASR) or utterance text using a simple SDK that supports the entire range of multimodal experiences enabled by Alexa.\u00a0  \n\nWe\u2019re excited about the experiences being created by developers, and we\u2019ll have more to share soon from companies like Character.AI, Splash, BMW, Volley, Sleep Jar, Voice Apps, and OpenTable who are enabling customers to do things like talk to fictional characters, create their own songs, play\u00a0single and multi-agent driven games on Alexa-enabled devices, learn about the features of their vehicle and so much more.\u00a0  \n\nLeverage differentiated offerings for smart home developers  \n\nToday, customers have connected over 400 million smart home devices to Alexa. Our partners have been critical in helping build smart home experiences\u00a0with devices from all brands working seamlessly together to make customers\u2019 lives easier. We will be leveraging generative AI to allow customers to control their smart home devices for a variety of actions through flexible and natural conversations, which Alexa\u2019s LLM will map to the unique and differentiated features of their products. To cover the broadest set of use cases, we will be providing developers with a path for both common integrations such as on/off or start/stop actions, and more complex ones such as actions related to dynamic lighting or custom cleaning operations for a vacuum cleaner.  \n\nSmart home Generic Controller Interfaces such as our existing Alexa.RangeController and Alexa.ModeController remain a simple yet effective way to integrate devices with Alexa for common use cases. A new interface called Action Controller extends this further by enabling device makers to model simple actions, targets, and states to control their devices, giving customers the ability to interact naturally with their devices. This means customers using Alexa\u2019s LLM can say \u201cAlexa, the floor is dirty,\u201d and Alexa will be able to infer the intended action is \u2018vacuum\u2019, and state \u2018start.\u2019 Action Controller makes it simple for device makers to model new supported actions and targets. To take advantage of Action Controller, you need to 1) define your supported device actions such as clean, mop, or dock 2) define a list of targets such as \u2018kitchen\u2019 or \u2018living room,\u2019 3) choose the state(s) to support (choose one or more actions from start/stop/pause/resume) and 4) implement the required directive and state updates when Alexa sends the requested actions to your skills.\n\nBelow is an example of a multi-functional device modeled using the Action Controller instance.

We\u2019ve always thought of Alexa as an evolving service, and we\u2019ve been continuously improving it since the day we introduced it in 2014.  \n\nVisitors to the Amazon Experience Area during CES 2024 will experience how Amazon\u2019s innovations in artificial intelligence helps people live productive and fulfilled lives by making every day better.\n\nThe \u301071\u2020Character.AI\u2020character.ai\u3011 Alexa experience brings to life the science-fiction dream of open-ended conversations and collaborations with computers. The experience allows customers to interact with any of predefined 28 Characters across four categories (General assistants, Skill helpers, Historical icons, and Just for fun).\n\nCustomers will also get access to even more ways for music to be created. Splash, an Alexa Fund portfolio company, is connecting its AI-powered music creation technology to Alexa, enabling customers to interact with the experience and do things like generate lyrics, select vocals and style, and make original music just by conversing with Alexa. From there, a link to the song is created in the experience that can be sent to the customer\u2019s mobile phone.\n\nVolley, also an Alexa Fund portfolio company, brings it\u2019s AI-powered \u201c20 Questions\u201d game to life. Volley\u2019s Alexa experience is a deeper version of the well known parlor game, using generative AI to interact with customers through questions and engaging conversation. All through the power of voice.\n\nThese experiences leverage our new LLM-powered tools announced at our Fall Devices and Services launch event.

We\u2019ve always thought of Alexa as an evolving service, and we\u2019ve been continuously improving it since the day we introduced it in 2014.  \n\nVisitors to the Amazon Experience Area during CES 2024 will experience how Amazon\u2019s innovations in artificial intelligence helps people live productive and fulfilled lives by making every day better.\n\nThe \u301071\u2020Character.AI\u2020character.ai\u3011 Alexa experience brings to life the science-fiction dream of open-ended conversations and collaborations with computers. The experience allows customers to interact with any of predefined 28 Characters across four categories (General assistants, Skill helpers, Historical icons, and Just for fun).\n\nCustomers will also get access to even more ways for music to be created. Splash, an Alexa Fund portfolio company, is connecting its AI-powered music creation technology to Alexa, enabling customers to interact with the experience and do things like generate lyrics, select vocals and style, and make original music just by conversing with Alexa. From there, a link to the song is created in the experience that can be sent to the customer\u2019s mobile phone.\n\nVolley, also an Alexa Fund portfolio company, brings it\u2019s AI-powered \u201c20 Questions\u201d game to life. Volley\u2019s Alexa experience is a deeper version of the well known parlor game, using generative AI to interact with customers through questions and engaging conversation. All through the power of voice.\n\nThese experiences leverage our new LLM-powered tools announced at our Fall Devices and Services launch event. With these tools, developers will be able to create experiences that allow customers to access real-time data, enjoy immersive generative AI-enhanced games, perform tasks like booking restaurant reservations, getting a succinct summary of a trending news story, and more.  \n\nThe tools announced at the event will enable developers to integrate content and APIs with Alexa\u2019s LLM to create conversational experiences for Alexa-enabled devices, or alternatively, integrate with an LLM of their choice without having to write complex code or train specific interaction models.  \n\nYou can read more about the new developer tools at \u301072\u2020developer.amazon.com\u3011. \u301070\u2020Visit the Amazon Experience Area at CES 2024\u3011 to see these experiences in action.\n\n#### Recommended Reading\n\n\u301073\u2020 \u3011 \n\n##### &quot;A shared vision with Amazon to create unprecedented value for customers&quot;: Akira Toyoshima, CEO of Panasonic Entertainment &amp; Communication\n\n\u301074\u2020 \u3011 \n\n##### Amazon announces expanded development options for device makers building connected devices with the Alexa Connect Kit for Matter\n\n\u301075\u2020 \u3011 \n\n##### Amazon Alexa Fund portfolio company MultiOn aims to be a personal assistant for everyone\n\n#### Subscribe\n\nBack to Top \n\n### Alexa Skills Kit\n\n  * \u301076\u2020Alexa Skills Kit\u3011\n  * \u301077\u2020Learn\u3011\n  * \u301078\u2020Design\u3011\n  * \u301079\u2020Build\u3011\n  * \u301080\u2020Launch\u3011\n\n### Resources\n\n  * \u301081\u2020Getting Started\u3011\n  * \u301082\u2020Tutorials\u3011\n  * \u301011\u2020Documentation\u3011\n  * \u301083\u2020Stack Overflow\u2020forums.developer.amazon.com\u3011\n  * \u301084\u2020Agencies and Tools\u3011\n\n### Alexa Voice Service\n\n  * \u301085\u2020Alexa Voice Service\u3011\n  * \u301086\u2020Learn\u3011\n  * \u301087\u2020Design\u3011\n  * \u301088\u2020Build\u3011\n  * \u301089\u2020Launch\u3011\n\n### AVS Resources\n\n  * \u301055\u2020Getting Started\u3011\n  * \u301090\u2020AVS Device SDK\u3011\n  * \u301091\u2020AVS API\u3011\n  * \u301092\u2020Dev Kits for AVS\u3011\n\n### Connected Devices\n\n  * \u301093\u2020Alexa Smart Home\u3011\n  * \u301094\u2020Alexa Gadgets\u3011\n\n### Agreements\n\n  * \u301095\u2020Agreements and Terms\u3011\n  * \u301096\u2020Program Materials License Agreement\u3011\n  * \u301097\u2020Amazon Developers Services Portal Terms of Use\u3011\n\n### Blogs\n\n  * \u301061\u2020Alexa Skills Kit Blog\u3011\n  * \u301062\u2020Device Makers Blog\u3011\n  * \u301098\u2020AWS Blog\u2020aws.amazon.com\u3011\n  * \u301064\u2020Alexa Science\u2020www.amazon.science\u3011\n\n### Support\n\n  * \u301099\u2020Amazon Developer Support\u3011\n  * \u30104\u2020Contact Us\u3011\n  * \u301083\u2020Stack Overflow\u2020forums.developer.amazon.com\u3011\n  * \u3010100\u2020Manage Email Preferences\u2020build.amazonalexadev.com\u3011\n\nFollow Us:  \u3010101\u2020 \u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 \u3010102\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u3010103\u2020 \u3011 \n\n  English (US) \n\nEnglish (ANZ) English (UK) English (India) Japanese (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e) French (Fran\u00e7ais) Italian (Italiano) German (Deutsch) Spanish (Espa\u00f1a) Spanish (M\u00e9xico) Portuguese (Brasil) Arabic (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629) \n\n\u00a9 2010 - 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. or its", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "mclick", "args": ["[0, 1, 4]"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "10883603-dbdf-4b9a-98c8-a3221e1510b0", "request_id": "8d2aeb5efa67524c-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "10883603-dbdf-4b9a-98c8-a3221e1510b0", "children": ["83236308-a2de-4619-a3db-2719538454e0"]}, "83236308-a2de-4619-a3db-2719538454e0": { "message": { "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1728944074.279042, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Based on what is available today, Amazon recently announced new tools that allow developers to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with Alexa, either through Amazon\u2019s own models or external ones.

The key features include:\n\n1. **Integration with Alexa&#x27;s LLM**: Developers can create conversational experiences by integrating content and APIs into Alexa\u2019s built-in LLM, enabling real-time data access, voice interactions, and more.\n2. **Third-party LLM Support**: You can use an LLM of your choice (e.g., OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4) with Alexa for various experiences, including generative AI-enhanced games or booking systems.\n3. **Simplified Development**: The new SDK makes it easier to develop for Alexa without complex code or specific interaction models, expanding the scope of what Alexa can do.\n\nThis means that with these updates, developers like you can build and integrate your own LLMs (such as GPT-4) into Alexa Skills and deploy them to users on Alexa-enabled devices.\n\nFor more detailed information on how to start using these new capabilities, you can visit Amazon\u2019s [Alexa AI Developer Page](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-ai)\u3010238\u2020source\u3011\u3010239\u2020source\u3011."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

We\u2019ve always thought of Alexa as an evolving service, and we\u2019ve been continuously improving it since the day we introduced it in 2014.  \n\nVisitors to the Amazon Experience Area during CES 2024 will experience how Amazon\u2019s innovations in artificial intelligence helps people live productive and fulfilled lives by making every day better.\n\nThe \u301071\u2020Character.AI\u2020character.ai\u3011 Alexa experience brings to life the science-fiction dream of open-ended conversations and collaborations with computers. The experience allows customers to interact with any of predefined 28 Characters across four categories (General assistants, Skill helpers, Historical icons, and Just for fun).\n\nCustomers will also get access to even more ways for music to be created. Splash, an Alexa Fund portfolio company, is connecting its AI-powered music creation technology to Alexa, enabling customers to interact with the experience and do things like generate lyrics, select vocals and style, and make original music just by conversing with Alexa. From there, a link to the song is created in the experience that can be sent to the customer\u2019s mobile phone.\n\nVolley, also an Alexa Fund portfolio company, brings it\u2019s AI-powered \u201c20 Questions\u201d game to life. Volley\u2019s Alexa experience is a deeper version of the well known parlor game, using generative AI to interact with customers through questions and engaging conversation. All through the power of voice.\n\nThese experiences leverage our new LLM-powered tools announced at our Fall Devices and Services launch event. With these tools, developers will be able to create experiences that allow customers to access real-time data, enjoy immersive generative AI-enhanced games, perform tasks like booking restaurant

We\u2019ve always thought of Alexa as an evolving service, and we\u2019ve been continuously improving it since the day we introduced it in 2014.  \n\nVisitors to the Amazon Experience Area during CES 2024 will experience how Amazon\u2019s innovations in artificial intelligence helps people live productive and fulfilled lives by making every day better.\n\nThe \u301071\u2020Character.AI\u2020character.ai\u3011 Alexa experience brings to life the science-fiction dream of open-ended conversations and collaborations with computers. The experience allows customers to interact with any of predefined 28 Characters across four categories (General assistants, Skill helpers, Historical icons, and Just for fun).\n\nCustomers will also get access to even more ways for music to be created. Splash, an Alexa Fund portfolio company, is connecting its AI-powered music creation technology to Alexa, enabling customers to interact with the experience and do things like generate lyrics, select vocals and style, and make original music just by conversing with Alexa. From there, a link to the song is created in the experience that can be sent to the customer\u2019s mobile phone.\n\nVolley, also an Alexa Fund portfolio company, brings it\u2019s AI-powered \u201c20 Questions\u201d game to life. Volley\u2019s Alexa experience is a deeper version of the well known parlor game, using generative AI to interact with customers through questions and engaging conversation. All through the power of voice.\n\nThese experiences leverage our new LLM-powered tools announced at our Fall Devices and Services launch event.

Kennedy. The &quot;magic bullet&quot; refers to the single bullet that allegedly caused multiple wounds to both President Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally. It has been a point of contention and debate for decades.\n\n**Applicability of Actuarial Statistics:**\n\nActuarial statistics are typically used to assess risk and predict future events by analyzing large datasets of similar occurrences\u2014such as life expectancies, insurance claims, or accident rates. These statistics rely on the law of large numbers to produce meaningful probabilities.\n\n**Challenges in Applying Actuarial Statistics to the &quot;Magic Bullet&quot;:**\n\n1. **Unique Event:** The assassination is a singular historical event with no directly comparable cases. This uniqueness makes it unsuitable for traditional actuarial analysis, which depends on patterns observed in numerous similar events.\n\n2. **Lack of Data:** There is insufficient empirical data on similar ballistic scenarios where one bullet caused multiple wounds in two people under the exact same conditions. Without a dataset, calculating a statistical probability is not feasible.\n\n3. **Complex Variables:** Factors such as bullet trajectory, the relative positions of Kennedy and Connally, bullet deformation, and human anatomy introduce complexities that are better addressed through forensic science than actuarial methods.\n\n**Forensic Analysis Over Statistical Probability:**\n\n- **Warren Commission Findings:** The Warren Commission conducted extensive forensic analyses, including reenactments and ballistic tests. They concluded that the single-bullet theory was plausible given the evidence.\n\n- **Subsequent Studies:** Later investigations, including those by the FBI and independent experts, have revisited the &quot;magic bullet&quot; scenario using advanced technology. Many have found that the bullet&#x27;s trajectory and the wounds are consistent with the laws of physics and ballistics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the &quot;magic bullet&quot; theory raises valid questions, assigning a weighted statistical probability using actuarial methods is not practical due to the lack of comparable data and the event&#x27;s unique nature. The plausibility of the single-bullet theory is better evaluated through forensic science, which considers the physical evidence and applies principles of physics and biology.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the &quot;magic bullet&quot; theory, I suggest reviewing forensic analyses and expert testimonies from reputable sources. These provide detailed explanations of how the event could have occurred without requiring statistical probabilities that cannot be accurately calculated in this context."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Truman** (1950) \u2013 An attempt at Blair House; he was unharmed.\n- **Gerald Ford** (1975) \u2013 Two separate attempts; both failed.\n- **Ronald Reagan** (1981) \u2013 Shot by John Hinckley Jr.; survived after surgery.\n\n### **Estimating the Likelihood**\n\n**Total Number of Presidents:** 46 (as of 2021)\n\n**Time Span:** 232 years (from 1789 to 2021)\n\n**Assassinations:**\n\n- **Successful:** 4\n- **Attempts (including successful):** Approximately 20 known attempts\n\n**Challenges in Calculation:**\n\n1. **Incomplete Data on Public Events:** Presidents have participated in countless public events, but precise records of every parade or appearance are not readily available.\n2. **Changing Frequency of Events:** The number of public appearances has varied with each presidency and over different historical periods.\n3. **Evolution of Security Measures:** Advances in security have significantly altered the risk over time.\n4. **Contextual Factors:** Political climate, societal tensions, and technological advancements influence the likelihood of an assassination attempt.\n\n**Simplified Calculation:**\n\nFor a rough estimate, let&#x27;s make some assumptions:\n\n1. **Average Number of Public Events per President per Year:** Suppose a president attends 200 public events annually (this is a hypothetical figure for illustrative purposes).\n2. **Total Number of Presidential Years:** 232 years\n3. **Total Public Events:** \\( 200 \\text{ events/year} \\times 232 \\text{ years} = 46,400 \\text{ events} \\)\n\n**Probability of a Successful Assassination per Event:**\n\n- \\( \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Successful Assassinations}}{\\text{Total Public Events}} \\)\n- \\( \\text{Probability} = \\frac{4}{46,400} \\approx 0.0086\\% \\) chance per event\n\n**Probability of an Assassination Attempt per Event:**\n\n- \\( \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Attempts}}{\\text{Total Public Events}} \\)\n- \\( \\text{Probability} = \\frac{20}{46,400} \\approx 0.043\\% \\) chance per event\n\n### **Limitations of the Estimate**\n\n1. **Hypothetical Numbers:** The average number of public events is assumed and may not reflect actual figures.\n2. **Variability Over Time:** Early presidents made fewer public appearances due to travel limitations, while modern presidents may attend more events.\n3. **Non-Randomness of Events:** Assassination attempts are influenced by specific motives and circumstances, not by chance alone.\n4. **Security Enhancements:** After each incident, security measures improved, reducing the likelihood of future attempts.\n\n### **Considerations for Actuarial Analysis**\n\nActuarial statistics rely on large datasets of similar, repeatable events to calculate probabilities. Presidential assassinations are rare and influenced by unique factors, making actuarial methods less applicable. Additionally, the emotional and societal impact of such events extends beyond what can be captured by statistical probabilities.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile it&#x27;s possible to estimate a rough probability of an assassination occurring during a presidential parade or public event, the resulting percentage is extremely low and subject to significant uncertainty. The rarity of these events, coupled with their dependence on specific historical and social contexts, limits the usefulness of such calculations.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n\n- **Historical Research:** For a more precise analysis, detailed historical records of presidential schedules and public events would be necessary.\n- **Contextual Analysis:** Understanding the sociopolitical factors surrounding each assassination attempt provides more insight than statistical probabilities.\n- **Security Studies:** Evaluations by security experts offer practical assessments of risk and inform protective measures more effectively than actuarial statistics in this context.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAssessing the likelihood of a presidential assassination using actuarial statistics is challenging due to the unique and infrequent nature of these events. While historical data can offer some perspective, the complexities involved mean that such probabilities should be interpreted with caution and an understanding of their limitations."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

A total of six manned missions landed on the lunar surface:\n\n1. **Apollo 11 (July 20, 1969):** Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon, while Michael Collins orbited above.\n2. **Apollo 12 (November 19, 1969):** Charles Conrad and Alan Bean landed on the Moon; Richard Gordon remained in lunar orbit.\n3. **Apollo 14 (February 5, 1971):** Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell landed; Stuart Roosa stayed in orbit.\n4. **Apollo 15 (July 30, 1971):** David Scott and James Irwin landed; Alfred Worden orbited the Moon.\n5. **Apollo 16 (April 21, 1972):** John Young and Charles Duke landed; Thomas Mattingly orbited.\n6. **Apollo 17 (December 11, 1972):** Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt landed; Ronald Evans orbited.\n\n**Evidence Supporting the Moon Landings:**\n\n- **Lunar Samples:** Astronauts brought back 382 kilograms (842 pounds) of Moon rocks and soil, which have been studied worldwide and are unlike Earth materials.\n- **Photographic and Video Evidence:** Thousands of photos and hours of video footage document the missions.\n- **Equipment Left on the Moon:** Instruments like the Lunar Laser Ranging Retroreflector arrays are still operational. Scientists use them to measure the distance between the Earth and the Moon with high precision.\n- **Global Tracking:** Observatories and tracking stations around the world monitored the missions, including those in countries not aligned with the U.S., such as the Soviet Union.\n- **Third-Party Verification:** Independent organizations and countries have confirmed the landings. For example, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has photographed the landing sites, showing equipment and footprints left by astronauts.\n\n**Is There Really a Dark Side to the Moon?**\n\nThe term &quot;dark side of the Moon&quot; is a common misconception. Here&#x27;s the accurate explanation:\n\n- **Tidally Locked Rotation:** The Moon is tidally locked with Earth, meaning it rotates on its axis in the same amount of time it takes to orbit Earth\u2014about 27.3 days. This synchronization causes the same side (the &quot;near side&quot;) to always face Earth.\n  \n- **Far Side vs. Dark Side:**\n  - **Far Side:** The side of the Moon that is not visible from Earth is called the &quot;far side.&quot;\n  - **Dark Side Misnomer:** The far side is not perpetually dark. It experiences day and night cycles just like the near side. Each side of the Moon gets roughly two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of darkness.\n\n- **Exploration of the Far Side:**\n  - **First Images:** The Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft photographed the far side in 1959.\n  - **Recent Missions:** In 2019, China&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 4 mission successfully landed a rover on the Moon&#x27;s far side, the first ever to do so.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The U.S. moon landings are well-documented historical events supported by substantial evidence.\n- The &quot;dark side of the Moon&quot; is a misnomer; both sides receive sunlight. The far side is simply the side we cannot see from Earth due to the Moon&#x27;s synchronous rotation.\n\n**Feel free to ask if you have more questions about the Moon, space exploration, or related topics!**"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

They can support digestion, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy circulation. Celery is known for its diuretic properties, helping with water retention and cleansing the body.

Chamomile tea or tincture can help with anxiety, promote relaxation, and improve sleep quality. While it won\u2019t produce euphoria, it\u2019s effective for stress relief and relaxation.\n\n### 2. **Valerian Root**\nValerian root is another strong herbal remedy used for relaxation and to aid sleep. It&#x27;s more potent than chamomile and can be found in tincture or tea form. It has sedative effects and is used to alleviate insomnia and anxiety. This is one of the closest herbal options to match the deep relaxation and sleep-inducing effects of THC.\n\n### 3. **Passionflower**\nPassionflower is another herb known for its calming properties. It can be found in some health sections and can help reduce anxiety, mild depression, and insomnia. Passionflower can induce a state of calmness, much like some cannabinoid products but without the euphoric effects.\n\n### 4. **Lavender**\nLavender is well known for its calming aroma and can be found in various forms, including tea, tinctures, or oils. It helps reduce stress, anxiety, and tension, though it\u2019s more of a calming and mood-lifting herb rather than one that induces euphoria.\n\n### 5. **Lemon Balm**\nLemon balm can be found in tea or tincture form and is widely available in stores. It\u2019s a calming herb that helps with anxiety, stress, and improving mood. It&#x27;s a mild herbal relaxant that might give you a feeling of contentment or light mood elevation.\n\n### 6. **Sage**\nSage tincture or tea can have mild calming and anti-inflammatory effects. It&#x27;s often used for cognitive enhancement and to improve mood, though its effects are milder than the deep body relaxation from THC.\n\n### 7. **Peppermint**\nPeppermint tea or tinctures can be found in many stores and may offer mild relaxation. Though it&#x27;s typically used for digestive issues, it can help ease stress and offer a cooling sense of relaxation.\n\nWould any of these herbal options suit what you\u2019re looking for?

Shake the jar gently to combine.\n\n3. **Seal and Store**: Close the jar tightly and store it in a cool, dark place for at least 2 weeks. Shake the jar once a day to help with extraction.\n\n4. **Strain the Mixture**: After 2 to 4 weeks (the longer it sits, the stronger the tincture), strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the plant material.\n\n5. **Bottle the Tincture**: Pour the liquid into a dropper bottle for easy use.\n\n### Usage:\nPeppermint tincture can be used for digestion, to freshen breath, or for its calming effects. The tincture will have a strong minty flavor, and the alcohol helps extract the beneficial oils from the peppermint. You can add it to water, tea, or take it directly under your tongue (though it will have a strong taste due to the alcohol).\n\nWhile peppermint won\u2019t provide the same euphoric effects as a Green Dragon cannabis tincture, it can still offer soothing and digestive benefits.\n\nDoes this sound like the kind of tincture you&#x27;re interested in making?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Both herbs have great health benefits\u2014mint for digestive aid and calming effects, and sage for its anti-inflammatory and cognitive-enhancing properties. Here\u2019s how you can use them together to create a tincture similar to the Green Dragon method, but with these herbs instead:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **Dried mint** (you can use any dried mint leaves, such as peppermint or spearmint)\n- **Fresh sage leaves** (you can also dry them if you prefer, but fresh works well too)\n- **High-proof alcohol** (Everclear or another strong alcohol, 75% or higher)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Jar**: Place a combination of dried mint and fresh sage into a clean glass jar. You can use any ratio you prefer, but for a balanced tincture, try:\n   - 1/2 cup dried mint leaves\n   - 1/2 cup fresh sage leaves (or adjust based on how strong you want the sage flavor)\n\n2. **Add the Alcohol**: Pour enough alcohol into the jar to completely submerge the herbs. Shake the jar to make sure everything is mixed well. The alcohol will act as the solvent, extracting the beneficial compounds from both the mint and sage.\n\n3. **Seal and Store**: Close the jar tightly and store it in a cool, dark place for 2-4 weeks. Shake the jar daily to help with the extraction process. The longer it sits, the stronger the tincture will become.\n\n4. **Strain the Mixture**: After the desired infusion period, strain the herbs from the liquid using a fine-mesh sieve, cheesecloth, or coffee filter. Make sure to press out as much liquid as possible from the herbs.\n\n5. **Bottle the Tincture**: Transfer the strained tincture into a dropper bottle for easy use. Keep it in a dark glass bottle to protect it from light and preserve its potency.\n\n### How to Use:\n- **Dosage**: Start with small doses, like 1-2 drops under the tongue or added to water, tea, or juice.\n- **Effects**: This tincture will be soothing and may help with digestion (from the mint), while the sage will add potential cognitive benefits and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n### Flavor Profile:\nThe combination of mint and sage will have a refreshing, slightly earthy flavor. The alcohol will intensify these flavors, so adding it to a beverage might make it more palatable.\n\nThis mixture won\u2019t have the euphoric effects of THC, but it will give you a potent herbal tincture that can help with digestion, relaxation, and mental clarity.

The romance between Ruyi and the emperor starts strong but faces many challenges. It has complex political and personal relationships within the palace, similar to &quot;Empresses in the Palace,&quot; but the emperor is depicted more romantically.\n\n2. **Legend of Hao Lan** \u2013 Set during the Warring States period, this drama features a strong female protagonist who rises to power. It involves palace intrigue and romance, with her relationship with an influential man being key to her journey.\n\n### Korean Dramas:\n1. **Queen for Seven Days** \u2013 This drama has a tragic love story about a woman who becomes queen for just seven days due to palace intrigue. The leading male is the king, and their romance is central to the plot, though their love is complicated by politics and betrayal.\n\n2. **The King&#x27;s Affection** \u2013 Though it takes a more unique twist, the female lead disguises herself as the crown prince and navigates the palace&#x27;s power struggles. There\u2019s a romantic element with her love interest who is unaware of her true identity.\n\n### Japanese Dramas:\n1. **Atsuhime** \u2013 A historical J-drama about the rise of a woman in the Tokugawa Shogunate, where she becomes an influential figure. Her story doesn\u2019t focus on the emperor, but it has strong political and personal themes similar to C-dramas like &quot;The Story of Minglan.&quot;\n\n### Turkish Dramas:\n1. **Magnificent Century** \u2013 This iconic Turkish historical drama is perfect for those who love palace intrigue. It focuses on H\u00fcrrem Sultan\u2019s rise from a concubine to becoming one of the most powerful women in the Ottoman Empire.

She falls in love with a wealthy man, and the romance plays out with plenty of social intrigue, secrets, and drama.

The main character, Atsuhime, marries the shogun, and their relationship evolves with mutual respect and understanding. While it\u2019s not heavily romantic, it does feature deep emotional connections amidst the political intrigue.\n\nHere are additional options, including Thai dramas, that align with your preferences for harem, powerful male leads, and no time travel:\n\n### Thai Dramas:\n1. **Love Destiny (Buppesannivas)** \u2013 Although this drama includes a time-travel element, it\u2019s extremely popular in Thailand for its palace intrigue and romantic storyline. If you can overlook the time travel aspect, the romance between the lead character and a nobleman is captivating, with plenty of scheming women in the background.\n\n2. **Klin Kasalong** \u2013 A Thai historical drama with dual timelines (but not traditional time travel), it features two sisters, one of whom is a kind soul, while the other is deeply jealous and scheming. There\u2019s a complicated romantic relationship with a nobleman that weaves throughout the story. The scheming women and the intensity of the emotional conflicts are strong points.\n\n3. **Roy Leh Marnya** \u2013 This modern Thai drama centers on the romance between a wealthy man and a woman who ends up in a manipulative relationship. While not a historical or royal drama, it has strong scheming female characters and dramatic twists.\n\n### Chinese Dramas:\n1. **Princess Silver** \u2013 This drama features a princess who gets caught in political intrigue, falling for a prince she\u2019s arranged to marry. There\u2019s a love triangle with another prince, and the scheming women in the palace add a layer of tension. The romance is a key element, and the male leads are both strong, powerful figures.\n\n2. **Love and Redemption** \u2013 While it has some fantasy elements, the core romance between the male lead, who is a powerful lord, and the female lead is intense and drives the plot. There are also plenty of scheming, evil characters, and a fulfilling ending where justice prevails.\n\n3. **General and I** \u2013 The female lead is a brilliant strategist who ends up entangled with a powerful general. The story follows their love as they navigate wars and palace intrigue. It\u2019s known for its sharp and intelligent lead characters, and the romance is central to the plot.\n\nThese options mix in harem dynamics, powerful male figures, and the scheming intrigue you enjoy, with strong romantic arcs and endings that provide satisfying conclusions.

These dramas are known for their over-the-top melodrama, intense love-hate relationships, and often chaotic romantic triangles. In many Lakhorns, characters can be indecisive or &quot;wishy-washy&quot; about their love interests, leading to a lot of misunderstandings, jealousy, and drama.\n\nHowever, not all Thai dramas have these elements. Some Lakhorns focus more on romance and palace intrigue without the extreme melodrama or physical confrontations. If you\u2019re not into the catfights and emotional flip-flopping, you might want to be selective with which ones you pick.\n\nFor example:\n- **Klin Kasalong** has some of the intense melodrama but is more plot-driven and less about physical altercations.\n- **Roy Leh Marnya** deals with manipulative relationships but doesn\u2019t have the typical physical catfights you\u2019d see in other Lakhorns.\n\nIf you&#x27;d like to avoid these Lakhorn tropes, I can help suggest more series that focus on palace dynamics or strong romantic leads without the excessive melodrama.

Their relationship starts cold but evolves into a deep romance. There\u2019s palace intrigue and manipulation, with some rivalry between women, but it\u2019s more subtle than full-blown catfights.\n\n3. **Raeng Tawan** \u2013 This Lakhorn is about a man seeking revenge on the family responsible for his parents&#x27; death. He falls for the daughter of his enemy, and their love story is full of intense emotional conflicts and a few catfights. There\u2019s a lot of dramatic tension, but the characters grow and develop in their relationships.\n\nThese dramas feature a mix of romance, rivalry, and some of that catfight element, while also keeping the story focused on the central romance and character development.

Based on the information you&#x27;ve provided, the most likely cause of his diarrhea and the small amount of red in his stool is the sudden changes in his diet.\n\n**Possible Causes:**\n\n1. **Dietary Changes:** Abruptly changing a dog&#x27;s diet can upset their gastrointestinal system. Over the past few days, your dog has had several dietary adjustments:\n   - Started with boiled chicken breast and puffed rice (&quot;riso soffiato&quot;).\n   - Switched to chicken with sweet potato.\n   - Introduced Forza10 croquettes (a new food) alongside the chicken and puffed rice.\n\n2. **Food Sensitivities:** Introducing new foods like sweet potato or the Forza10 croquettes might have ingredients that your dog is sensitive or allergic to.\n\n3. **Spoiled Food:** Although you mentioned the chicken smelled okay, cooked chicken should ideally be used within 3-4 days when refrigerated. There&#x27;s a chance it may have begun to spoil, causing digestive upset.\n\n4. **Gastrointestinal Irritation:** The red splotch you noticed could be a small amount of blood, which can occur when the intestines are irritated due to diarrhea.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Return to a Bland Diet:**\n   - Feed him a simple diet of **freshly boiled chicken and white rice** for the next few days.\n   - Avoid any additional foods or treats to allow his digestive system to stabilize.\n\n2. **Monitor His Hydration:**\n   - Ensure he has constant access to fresh water.\n   - Dehydration can be a concern with diarrhea, especially in small breeds.\n\n3. **Gradually Reintroduce Foods:**\n   - Once his stools return to normal, slowly reintroduce his regular diet over several days.\n   - Mix small amounts of his usual food with the bland diet, gradually increasing the proportion.\n\n4. **Watch for Additional Symptoms:**\n   - Keep an eye out for vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, or increased blood in the stool.\n   - Note any changes in behavior or energy levels.\n\n5. **Consult Your Veterinarian:**\n   - If the diarrhea persists for more than 24-48 hours, or if you continue to see blood in his stool, contact your vet.\n   - They may recommend a fecal examination to rule out parasites or infections.\n\n**Preventive Tips:**\n\n- **Avoid Sudden Diet Changes:** Introduce new foods gradually over a week to allow his system to adjust.\n- **Fresh Food Only:** Ensure all foods are fresh and properly stored. Cooked chicken should be refrigerated and used within 3-4 days.\n- **Portion Control:** Overfeeding can also cause digestive issues. Stick to recommended serving sizes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYour dog&#x27;s symptoms are likely due to the recent dietary changes and possibly introducing new foods too quickly. By returning to a bland diet and monitoring his condition, he should start to improve. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, seeking veterinary advice is the best course of action.\n\nI hope your chihuahua feels better soon!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It&#x27;s helpful to know exactly what your chihuahua has been eating. Let me address your questions and provide some guidance.\n\n**Can You Continue Feeding Turkey Bocconcini with White Rice and Riso Soffiato?**\n\n- **Turkey Bocconcini and White Rice:**\n  - **Yes**, feeding your dog boiled turkey with white rice is suitable for a bland diet. Turkey is a lean protein that&#x27;s gentle on the stomach, similar to chicken.\n  - **Portion Control:** Since you&#x27;ve portioned out the meals and stored them properly (some in the fridge for Friday and Saturday, and the rest in the freezer), that&#x27;s excellent. Just make sure to thaw frozen portions safely in the refrigerator before use.\n\n- **Riso Soffiato (Puffed Rice):**\n  - Given that your dog previously experienced constipation after eating riso soffiato, it might be best to **leave it out** for now.\n  - **Recommendation:** Stick to plain white rice, which is easier to digest and can help firm up stools.\n\n**Should You Leave Out the Riso Soffiato?**\n\n- **Yes**, omitting the riso soffiato is advisable until your dog&#x27;s digestive system stabilizes.\n- **Reasoning:**\n  - Since there&#x27;s a possibility that the puffed rice contributed to his constipation earlier, removing it can help eliminate potential irritants.\n  - Keeping his diet simple allows his gastrointestinal tract to recover.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Herbs Used in Cooking:**\n  - **Sage (Salvia) and Basil Leaves:**\n    - In small amounts, these herbs are generally safe for dogs and can even offer some health benefits.\n    - However, large quantities might cause digestive upset.\n    - Since you used only a couple of leaves, it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;re the cause, but you might consider omitting them to keep the diet as bland as possible.\n\n- **Monitor His Hydration:**\n  - Ensure he has plenty of fresh water available.\n  - Dehydration can occur quickly in small dogs with diarrhea.\n\n- **Watch for Symptoms:**\n  - **Improvement:** If his stools start to firm up and he seems more comfortable, continue the bland diet for a few days before gradually reintroducing his regular food.\n  - **No Improvement or Worsening Symptoms:**\n    - If diarrhea persists beyond 24-48 hours.\n    - If you notice more blood in his stool.\n    - If he becomes lethargic, refuses to eat, or shows other concerning signs.\n    - **Action:** Contact your veterinarian promptly.\n\n**Reintroducing Food:**\n\n- **Gradual Process:**\n  - When he&#x27;s ready, slowly mix small amounts of his regular food into the bland diet over several days.\n  - This gradual transition helps prevent further digestive upset.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Continue with the boiled turkey and white rice.\n- Omit the riso soffiato for now.\n- Consider leaving out the herbs to maintain a bland diet.\n- Monitor his condition closely.\n- Consult your veterinarian if there&#x27;s no improvement or if symptoms worsen.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nYour chihuahua&#x27;s digestive issues are likely due to recent dietary changes and possibly the introduction of new foods like puffed rice and the Forza10 croquettes. By simplifying his diet and eliminating potential irritants, you should see an improvement in his condition.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish your little one a speedy recovery!

I&#x27;d be happy to provide guidance on this.\n\n**Feeding 50% Ultima and 50% Bland Diet:**\n\n- **Nutritional Balance Concerns:**\n  - **Commercial Dog Foods:** Brands like Ultima are formulated to be **complete and balanced**, providing all the necessary nutrients in the correct proportions for your dog.\n  - **Bland Diets:** Boiled chicken and rice are easy on the stomach but are **not nutritionally complete**. They lack essential nutrients like certain vitamins, minerals (especially calcium), and fatty acids.\n\n- **Dilution of Nutrients:**\n  - By mixing 50% bland diet with 50% commercial food, you&#x27;re effectively diluting the nutrient density of the commercial diet.\n  - This means your dog may not receive adequate levels of essential nutrients, leading to potential deficiencies over time.\n\n**Feeding Bland Diet Plus a Doggy Multivitamin:**\n\n- **Incomplete Nutrient Profile:**\n  - **Multivitamins:** While they can supplement certain vitamins and minerals, they **do not cover all nutritional needs**, especially macronutrients like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in the correct ratios.\n  - **Calcium and Phosphorus:** Bland diets lack sufficient calcium. An imbalance between calcium and phosphorus can affect bone health, particularly in small breeds.\n\n- **Risks of Supplementation:**\n  - **Over-supplementation:** Giving multivitamins without professional guidance can lead to excesses of certain nutrients, which can be harmful.\n  - **Missing Nutrients:** Some nutrients may still be deficient despite supplementation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Primary Diet Should Be Complete and Balanced:**\n\n   - **Use Commercial Dog Food as the Main Component:**\n     - Continue feeding Ultima or another high-quality dog food appropriate for small breeds.\n     - These diets are carefully formulated to meet all of your dog&#x27;s nutritional requirements.\n\n2. **Use Bland Diet as Occasional Supplement or Treat:**\n\n   - **Moderation Is Key:**\n     - Offer small amounts of boiled chicken and rice as a treat or topper, not exceeding 10% of the total daily caloric intake.\n     - This keeps the primary diet nutritionally balanced while adding some variety.\n\n3. **Avoid Long-Term Use of Bland Diet as a Staple:**\n\n   - **Nutritional Deficiencies:**\n     - Relying heavily on a bland diet can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients.\n     - It&#x27;s intended for short-term use during digestive upsets, not as a long-term feeding plan.\n\n4. **Consult a Veterinary Nutritionist for Homemade Diets:**\n\n   - **Customized Diet Formulation:**\n     - If you&#x27;re interested in home-cooking for your dog, a veterinary nutritionist can help create a **balanced recipe** tailored to your dog&#x27;s specific needs.\n     - They will ensure the diet includes all necessary nutrients in the correct amounts.\n\n5. **Be Cautious with Supplements:**\n\n   - **Professional Guidance Needed:**\n     - Before adding any supplements or multivitamins, consult with your veterinarian.\n     - They can advise whether supplementation is necessary and safe based on your dog&#x27;s current diet and health status.\n\n6. **Monitor Your Dog&#x27;s Health:**\n\n   - **Regular Veterinary Check-Ups:**\n     - Regular visits will help ensure your dog remains healthy and any potential issues are caught early.\n   - **Watch for Signs of Nutritional Imbalance:**\n     - Symptoms like poor coat condition, lethargy, weight loss or gain, and digestive issues can indicate dietary problems.\n\n**Why a Balanced Diet Matters:**\n\n- **Overall Health:**\n  - Proper nutrition supports immune function, organ health, and overall vitality.\n- **Preventing Disease:**\n  - Balanced diets help prevent nutritional deficiencies and associated diseases.\n- **Longevity and Quality of Life:**\n  - Adequate nutrition contributes to a longer, healthier life for your dog.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nWhile it&#x27;s tempting to enhance your dog&#x27;s meals with homemade foods, it&#x27;s crucial to maintain the nutritional balance that commercial diets provide. Feeding a diet that&#x27;s 50% bland food or relying on multivitamins may not meet all your dog&#x27;s nutritional needs and could lead to health issues over time.\n\n**Suggested Approach:**\n\n- **Primary Diet:** Continue with the Ultima dog food as the main component of his meals.\n- **Occasional Additions:** Add small amounts of boiled chicken or carrots as occasional treats or meal toppers.\n- **Professional Consultation:** If you prefer a more significant homemade component, consult a veterinary nutritionist for a balanced recipe.\n\nBy ensuring your chihuahua receives a complete and balanced diet, you&#x27;ll support his health and happiness.

Dogs have specific requirements for proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. An imbalance or deficiency in any of these can lead to health issues over time.\n\n**Understanding Your Dog&#x27;s Nutritional Needs**\n\n1. **Proteins:** Essential for growth, maintenance, and repair of body tissues. High-quality animal proteins provide essential amino acids.\n2. **Fats:** Provide energy and essential fatty acids necessary for skin and coat health, as well as brain function.\n3. **Carbohydrates:** Supply energy and can be a source of fiber for digestive health.\n4. **Vitamins and Minerals:** Crucial for various metabolic processes, bone health, and overall well-being.\n\n**General Guidelines for a Balanced Home-Cooked Meal**\n\n1. **Protein Source (35-50% of the diet):**\n   - Lean meats such as chicken, turkey, beef, or fish.\n   - Organ meats like liver (in small amounts due to high vitamin A content).\n\n2. **Carbohydrate Source (30-50% of the diet):**\n   - Cooked grains like brown rice, quinoa, or oats.\n   - Starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes or regular potatoes.\n\n3. **Vegetables and Fruits (10-20% of the diet):**\n   - Non-starchy vegetables: carrots, green beans, broccoli, spinach.\n   - Fruits in moderation: blueberries, apples (without seeds).\n\n4. **Fats:**\n   - Fish oil or flaxseed oil for omega-3 fatty acids.\n   - Animal fats from meats can also contribute.\n\n5. **Supplements:**\n   - **Calcium:** Essential to balance the phosphorus in meat. Typically added through bone meal or calcium carbonate.\n   - **Multivitamin and Mineral Supplement:** To cover micronutrients that may be lacking.\n\n**Sample Recipe Outline**\n\n*Please note that this is a general example and may not meet all of your dog&#x27;s specific nutritional needs. Consulting with a veterinary nutritionist is strongly recommended.*\n\n- **Protein:** 1 cup of cooked lean chicken breast, chopped.\n- **Carbohydrate:** 1/2 cup of cooked brown rice.\n- **Vegetables:** 1/4 cup of steamed carrots and 1/4 cup of steamed green beans.\n- **Fats:** 1 teaspoon of fish oil.\n- **Calcium Supplement:** As per product instructions to balance phosphorus in meat.\n- **Multivitamin/Mineral Supplement:** Formulated for dogs, as directed.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n- **Balance Calcium and Phosphorus:** Meat is high in phosphorus but low in calcium. Without adequate calcium supplementation, your dog could develop bone disorders.\n- **Essential Fatty Acids:** Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are crucial for skin and coat health and should be included through appropriate oils.\n- **Avoid Toxic Foods:** Do not include onions, garlic, grapes, raisins, chocolate, or any other foods toxic to dogs.\n- **Portion Control:** Small breeds like chihuahuas and Italian greyhounds have different caloric needs. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, while underfeeding can cause malnutrition.\n\n**Steps to Create a Balanced Diet**\n\n1. **Consult a Veterinary Nutritionist:**\n   - They can provide a customized recipe tailored to your dog&#x27;s age, weight, activity level, and health status.\n   - They will ensure the diet meets the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) nutrient profiles for dogs.\n\n2. **Use Reliable Resources:**\n   - Consider reputable books or websites dedicated to canine nutrition authored by veterinary nutritionists.\n   - Examples include the BalanceIT website or books like &quot;Home-Prepared Dog and Cat Diets&quot; by Dr. Donald R. Strombeck.\n\n3. **Prepare Meals Safely:**\n   - Cook all meats thoroughly to kill harmful bacteria.\n   - Wash vegetables and cook grains properly.\n\n4. **Monitor Your Dog&#x27;s Health:**\n   - Keep an eye on weight, coat condition, energy levels, and stool quality.\n   - Regular veterinary check-ups to assess overall health.\n\n**Supplementation**\n\n- **Calcium Source:** Essential to prevent deficiencies. Options include:\n  - **Bone Meal Powder:** Food-grade quality.\n  - **Calcium Carbonate:** Often available as tablets or powders.\n- **Vitamin D and Other Micronutrients:** Necessary for calcium absorption and overall health.\n- **Commercial Supplements:** Products like BalanceIT can be used to ensure nutrient requirements are met.\n\n**Why Professional Guidance is Essential**\n\n- **Individual Needs Vary:** Nutritional requirements can differ based on health conditions, age, and activity level.\n- **Risk of Imbalances:** Over-supplementation or deficiencies can cause serious health issues.\n- **Formulating a Complete Diet is Complex:** Professionals use specialized knowledge and tools to calculate precise nutrient amounts.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nFeeding your dog a home-cooked diet can be rewarding and beneficial when done correctly. It&#x27;s vital to ensure that the diet is complete and balanced to support your dog&#x27;s health and longevity.\n\n**Action Steps:**\n\n1. **Schedule a Consultation:** Reach out to a veterinary nutritionist for a personalized diet plan.\n2. **Educate Yourself:** Read reputable sources on canine nutrition.\n3. **Prepare Meals Carefully:** Follow recipes exactly as prescribed, including all recommended supplements.\n4. **Monitor and Adjust:** Keep track of your dog&#x27;s response to the new diet and maintain regular veterinary visits.\n\nBy taking these steps, you&#x27;ll provide your chihuahua Italian greyhound mix with nutritious meals that support a happy, healthy life.\n\n---\n\n**References for Further Reading:**\n\n- **BalanceIT:** [www.balanceit.com](https://www.balanceit.com) - A tool and resource for pet owners to formulate balanced home-cooked diets.\n- **&quot;Home-Prepared Dog and Cat Diets&quot; by Dr. Donald R.

To unpack this, let&#x27;s dive into the active compounds, their pathways, and potential interactions.\n\n### 1. **Key Active Compounds in Coffee**\nCoffee contains various bioactive compounds, but the most notable is **caffeine**, a stimulant that affects the central nervous system. Other compounds, such as **chlorogenic acids** and **trigonelline**, also contribute to its effects but are less central in the context of the ECS.\n\n- **Caffeine** is an adenosine receptor antagonist, particularly affecting the **A1** and **A2A** adenosine receptors in the brain. By blocking these receptors, caffeine prevents the calming effects of adenosine, leading to increased alertness, wakefulness, and in some cases, anxiety.\n\n### 2. **The Endocannabinoid System (ECS)**\nThe ECS is a neuromodulatory system composed of **cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2)**, **endocannabinoids** (such as anandamide and 2-AG), and **enzymes** that synthesize and degrade these endocannabinoids.\n\n- **CB1 receptors**, primarily located in the brain and central nervous system, regulate mood, appetite, memory, and pain sensation.\n- **CB2 receptors** are mostly found in the immune system and peripheral tissues but can also influence brain function in certain conditions.\n- **Endocannabinoids** like **anandamide** are naturally produced in the body and are known as the brain\u2019s &quot;bliss molecules&quot; because they promote a feeling of well-being.\n\n### 3. **How Caffeine and Cannabinoids Interact in the Brain**\nThe potential interaction between caffeine and cannabinoids occurs primarily at the **adenosine receptors** and the **CB1 receptors** of the ECS, with downstream effects on neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine, serotonin, and GABA.\n\n#### a. **Caffeine&#x27;s Effect on the ECS**\n- **Adenosine A2A receptors**: These receptors are particularly interesting because they have a significant **interaction with CB1 receptors**. Both receptors can form **heteromers**, meaning that they can physically interact and influence each other\u2019s function. \n    - **Caffeine**, by antagonizing (blocking) adenosine receptors, can indirectly modulate **CB1 activity**. When **adenosine A2A** receptors are blocked, the inhibitory effects that adenosine has on CB1 receptor signaling may decrease. This may lead to increased activity of the ECS, enhancing the effects of cannabinoids (whether endogenous like anandamide or exogenous from cannabis).\n    \n#### b. **Caffeine Sensitivity and Cannabinoids**\nIn caffeine-sensitive individuals, the enhanced stimulatory effects on dopamine and norepinephrine (due to reduced adenosine activity) could **amplify** the psychoactive effects of cannabinoids. Increased caffeine levels can result in:\n- **Increased dopamine release**: Caffeine enhances dopamine signaling, and this can modulate the **pleasurable effects** of cannabinoids. Cannabinoids also increase dopamine release through CB1 receptor activation, so the combination of both substances could lead to a stronger sense of reward and mood elevation.\n- **Elevated anxiety or jitteriness**: In some people sensitive to caffeine, this heightened stimulation may lead to **increased anxiety** when cannabinoids are introduced. THC, for example, can cause anxiety in high doses, and caffeine might **potentiate this** effect.\n\n### 4. **Cannabinoids&#x27; Effect on Caffeine\u2019s Actions**\nCannabinoids, particularly **CBD (cannabidiol)** and **THC (tetrahydrocannabinol)**, have different ways of interacting with caffeine:\n- **THC**: As a **partial agonist** of CB1 receptors, THC can modulate neurotransmitter release, including dopamine. In a caffeine-sensitive brain, THC may **enhance the stimulant effects of caffeine** due to CB1 and adenosine A2A receptor interactions.\n    - Some reports suggest that THC may **mitigate the jitteriness** caused by caffeine, providing a smoother, more relaxed stimulation, though this is highly dose-dependent.\n- **CBD**: Unlike THC, CBD does not bind directly to CB1 receptors. Instead, it **modulates** the ECS indirectly by inhibiting the breakdown of endocannabinoids like anandamide, increasing their levels. \n    - **CBD and caffeine** may have complementary effects in a caffeine-sensitive individual. CBD\u2019s **anxiolytic (anti-anxiety)** properties could help counteract some of the nervousness and restlessness caffeine induces.\n\n### 5. **Practical Effects and Considerations**\n- In a caffeine-sensitive individual, **low doses of caffeine** combined with cannabinoids may produce **elevated mood**, enhanced focus, and creativity. However, higher doses of caffeine, especially when paired with THC, could lead to **increased anxiety**, restlessness, or even panic, especially if the cannabinoid dose is high.\n- **CBD**, on the other hand, might help counterbalance the **anxiety**-inducing effects of caffeine, making the combination of CBD and coffee a potentially calming yet stimulating blend.\n\n### 6. **Long-term Effects**\n- **Chronic use of caffeine** can lead to **tolerance** through upregulation of adenosine receptors, and this might impact the way the ECS functions over time. \n- The interaction between **habitual caffeine consumption** and cannabinoids could alter how the brain responds to both substances, potentially requiring adjustments in dosage for individuals seeking therapeutic effects from cannabinoids.\n\n### Summary of Interception Mechanism\n- Caffeine blocks **adenosine A2A receptors**, indirectly affecting **CB1 receptor activity**.\n- **THC** and **caffeine** may amplify each other\u2019s effects, possibly enhancing focus but also increasing the risk of **anxiety**.\n- **CBD** may **reduce anxiety** from caffeine while modulating ECS activity in a subtle way, promoting relaxation without sedation.\n\nIn a caffeine-sensitive brain, the combined effects of coffee and cannabinoids depend heavily on the individual\u2019s neurochemistry and the balance between stimulant and cannabinoid effects."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Psilocybin is not psychoactive by itself but is converted into psilocin through dephosphorylation (a process that happens in the liver and stomach).\n- **Psilocin**: The active metabolite of psilocybin, responsible for the psychedelic effects. Psilocin primarily acts as an **agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors** in the brain, leading to altered perception, thought, and mood.\n- Other compounds include **baeocystin** and **norbaeocystin**, which are psilocybin analogs that may contribute to the overall effects but are present in lower concentrations.\n\n### 2. **Extraction Process in Alcohol-Based Tinctures**\nWhen **Golden Teacher mushrooms** are submerged in an **alcohol-based tincture** (often made using ethanol or another solvent), the active compounds\u2014**psilocybin** and **psilocin**\u2014can be extracted efficiently. Alcohol is a good solvent for these compounds, making it suitable for creating a mixed tincture. \n\nSimilarly, **cannabinoids** like **THC** (tetrahydrocannabinol) and **CBD** (cannabidiol) from the cannabis tincture are also well-extracted in alcohol, making both the mushroom and cannabis active compounds available in the same solution.\n\n- **Psilocybin** is stable in alcohol, and the tincture can preserve its potency for a long period.\n- **Psilocin**, being less stable than psilocybin, can degrade over time or under certain conditions, but alcohol may help stabilize it for a limited period.\n  \n### 3. **Interaction Between Psilocybin, Cannabinoids, and Terpenes**\nIn this tincture, both **psilocybin (and psilocin)** from the mushrooms and **cannabinoids** from the cannabis tincture are present. Here\u2019s how these compounds could interact:\n\n#### a. **Psilocybin/Psilocin**\n- **Psilocin** acts on **serotonin 5-HT2A receptors**, creating **altered states of consciousness**, sensory enhancement, and sometimes ego dissolution.\n- It also has some affinity for other serotonin receptors, such as **5-HT1A** and **5-HT2C**, which contribute to its effects on mood and cognition.\n\n#### b. **THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)**\n- **THC**, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, primarily acts on **CB1 receptors** in the brain, leading to effects such as **euphoria, altered perception, and relaxation**.\n- THC also influences **dopamine release**, contributing to the feelings of reward and pleasure.\n\n#### c. **CBD (Cannabidiol)**\n- **CBD** is non-psychoactive and interacts indirectly with the **endocannabinoid system**. It has been shown to modulate the effects of THC and may **reduce anxiety** or **balance** some of THC\u2019s more intense psychoactive effects.\n- It also influences serotonin receptors (such as **5-HT1A**), which could interact with the serotoninergic activity of psilocin.\n\n#### d. **Terpenes**\n- **Terpenes**, aromatic compounds in cannabis, can also modulate the psychoactive effects. For instance, **limonene** may uplift mood, while **linalool** might promote relaxation and calm.\n\n### 4. **Potential Psychoactive Interactions in the Brain**\nWhen combined, **psilocybin/psilocin** and **cannabinoids** like THC and CBD could create **synergistic** or **modulatory effects**. Here are potential scenarios:\n\n#### a. **Enhancement of Perception and Hallucination**\nBoth **psilocin** (through serotonin receptors) and **THC** (through CB1 receptor activation) modulate sensory perception, but in different ways. Psilocin\u2019s alteration of sensory inputs may be **enhanced** by THC\u2019s effect on **visual and auditory perception**, leading to **vivid visualizations** or hallucinations. THC can **intensify the trip**, making colors more vibrant and sounds more profound.\n\n#### b. **Mood and Emotional Alteration**\n- **Psilocin** often creates **profound emotional experiences**, ranging from feelings of euphoria to introspective sadness or joy. **THC**, with its mood-enhancing properties, might **amplify the euphoria** or **sense of well-being** experienced during the psilocin trip.\n- **CBD** may help **reduce anxiety** or **mood swings**, acting as a buffer if the experience becomes overwhelming.\n\n#### c. **Cognitive and Memory Effects**\n- **Psilocybin** is known to induce **ego dissolution**, where the sense of self melts away, leading to experiences of unity and transcendence. **THC**, in higher doses, can contribute to memory impairment or **short-term confusion**, potentially intensifying the experience of ego loss or creating **temporary cognitive dissonance**.\n- **CBD** might help keep the mind more grounded, counteracting **short-term memory impairment** caused by THC and providing a clearer headspace within the altered cognitive framework of the psilocybin experience.\n\n#### d. **Anxiety and Relaxation**\nThe combination of **psilocin\u2019s serotonin activity** and **THC\u2019s CB1 receptor activation** could, for some users, lead to **increased anxiety**, especially if too much THC is present. However, if the tincture contains a balanced ratio of **CBD**, the **anxiolytic (anti-anxiety)** properties of CBD could help **counteract any paranoia or anxious feelings**.\n\n#### e. **Duration and Onset**\nThe onset of effects from the tincture may vary. **Psilocybin** taken in this form will still need to be metabolized into **psilocin** (though the alcohol might slightly enhance absorption), while **THC and CBD** can be absorbed more rapidly through the mucous membranes if the tincture is taken sublingually.\n- Expect a **slightly longer onset** compared to smoking cannabis or eating the mushrooms directly, but with potentially **longer-lasting effects**, due to the tincture\u2019s slow release.\n\n### 5. **Overall Synergistic Experience**\nThe combination of **psilocybin mushrooms** and **cannabis tincture** in an alcohol base may create a **unique psychoactive blend** that includes:\n- Enhanced **sensory perception**\n- **Altered cognition** and deep introspection\n- A potential **mood boost** from both psilocin and THC\n- The possibility of **relaxation** and **anxiolytic effects** from CBD and certain terpenes\n\nHowever, individual experiences will vary depending on the ratio of cannabinoids, the dose of psilocybin, the user\u2019s sensitivity to either substance, and the overall set and setting. The tincture format can make it easier to control the dose and tailor the experience, but combining these substances should be done cautiously, especially if high doses of either are involved.\n\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Let&#x27;s analyze how this affects the main compounds involved, such as **psilocybin**, **psilocin**, **cannabinoids** (like THC and CBD), and the tincture as a whole.\n\n### 1. **Effects on Psilocybin and Psilocin**\n\n- **Psilocybin**: Psilocybin is relatively stable in water and alcohol solutions at moderate temperatures. However, prolonged exposure to higher temperatures, such as 77\u00b0C, could lead to some **degradation** over time. Psilocybin itself is more stable than psilocin, so while the temperature might slightly reduce its potency, the effect would likely be mild over a period of one hour. Psilocybin is less sensitive to heat compared to psilocin.\n\n- **Psilocin**: Psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, is **less stable** and more prone to **degradation** when exposed to heat, light, and air. At 77\u00b0C, psilocin could undergo oxidation or hydrolysis, leading to **loss of potency**. Psilocin&#x27;s susceptibility to heat means that after an hour at this temperature, you might experience a **reduction in its psychoactive effects**, as some of the psilocin could degrade or convert into less active compounds.\n\n### 2. **Effects on Cannabinoids (THC and CBD)**\n\n- **THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)**: THC is more heat-resistant compared to psilocin. The temperature of **77\u00b0C** is below THC\u2019s **boiling point** (around 157\u00b0C), so it should remain largely **intact**. In fact, some **decarboxylation** of **THCA** (the acidic precursor of THC) could occur at this temperature, enhancing the tincture\u2019s THC potency if the cannabinoids were not fully decarboxylated before. The hour-long exposure should not cause significant THC degradation, but it could lead to **slightly more psychoactive THC** being available if there\u2019s THCA present.\n\n- **CBD (Cannabidiol)**: Similar to THC, **CBD** has a higher boiling point (~160-180\u00b0C) and is **fairly stable** at 77\u00b0C. Prolonged exposure to heat would not significantly degrade CBD over the course of one hour. If **CBDA** (the acidic precursor of CBD) is present, this temperature could promote some decarboxylation, increasing the amount of available **CBD** in the tincture.\n\n### 3. **Effects on Terpenes**\n\n- **Terpenes**, the aromatic compounds in cannabis, are more **volatile** and sensitive to heat. Many terpenes, such as **limonene, myrcene,** and **linalool**, have **boiling points** below or near 77\u00b0C. Therefore, keeping the tincture at this temperature for an hour would likely result in the **evaporation or degradation of some terpenes**, which could affect the overall flavor, aroma, and potential synergistic effects of the tincture (the &quot;entourage effect&quot;). While cannabinoids are more heat-resistant, you may lose some of the therapeutic or mood-enhancing qualities that terpenes contribute.\n\n### 4. **Potential Chemical Interactions**\n\nHeating the tincture could promote certain **chemical reactions** between compounds in the solution. At 77\u00b0C:\n- **Oxidation** of psilocin is a concern, potentially leading to reduced potency of the mushroom extract.\n- **Cannabinoids** are more stable and may not degrade significantly, but **terpenes** could break down or evaporate, altering the overall profile of the tincture.\n- The alcohol base should remain stable at this temperature, ensuring that the active compounds stay well-dissolved and extracted.\n\n### 5. **Overall Effects on the Tincture**\n\n- **Increased THC/CBD potency (if decarboxylation occurs)**: If the tincture contains **THCA or CBDA**, the heat could promote **decarboxylation**, converting these into the active forms, **THC** and **CBD**, potentially **increasing the psychoactive effects** of the tincture.\n- **Decreased psilocin potency**: Psilocin, being heat-sensitive, may degrade over time at this temperature, reducing its psychoactive contribution to the tincture.\n- **Loss of terpenes**: Terpenes could evaporate or degrade, affecting the flavor, aroma, and potentially the calming or mood-boosting effects associated with specific terpenes.\n\n### Summary\n\nLeaving the tincture in a **77\u00b0C water bath** for an hour will likely lead to:\n- **Minimal psilocybin degradation** but **reduced psilocin potency** due to heat sensitivity.\n- Possible **enhanced cannabinoid potency** through decarboxylation, especially if the tincture contains **THCA or CBDA**.\n- Loss of **terpenes**, leading to a change in the tincture\u2019s **aroma** and possibly reducing some of the entourage effects that enhance the experience.\n  \nUltimately, while the cannabinoids (THC and CBD) will likely remain intact or even increase in potency, the psilocin content may suffer, potentially weakening the psychedelic effects of the mushroom extract."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Let&#x27;s break down these differences:\n\n### 1. **Psilocybin and Psilocin Content: Fresh vs. Dried Mushrooms**\n\n#### **Fresh Mushrooms**\n- **Higher Psilocin Content**: Fresh mushrooms contain **more psilocin** compared to dried mushrooms. Psilocin is the compound responsible for the immediate psychoactive effects of the mushroom, binding directly to serotonin receptors in the brain (5-HT2A, 5-HT1A). Psilocin is more unstable and degrades over time when exposed to heat, air, or drying processes.\n- **Water Content**: Fresh mushrooms contain about **90% water**, which dilutes the concentration of active compounds (psilocybin and psilocin). This means that gram-for-gram, fresh mushrooms will be **less potent** by weight compared to dried mushrooms.\n- **Faster Degradation**: The high moisture content makes fresh mushrooms more **susceptible to microbial growth** (such as mold) and oxidation, especially in non-ideal storage conditions. Psilocin is particularly prone to **oxidation**, leading to loss of potency over time.\n\n#### **Dried Mushrooms**\n- **Higher Psilocybin-to-Psilocin Ratio**: When mushrooms are dried, **psilocin** degrades rapidly, leaving a higher ratio of **psilocybin**. Psilocybin is more chemically stable and acts as a **prodrug** to psilocin (which means that it converts into psilocin in the body). Dried mushrooms will thus have a greater percentage of their active compounds in the form of psilocybin, rather than psilocin.\n- **Higher Potency by Weight**: Since dried mushrooms have lost their water content (about 90% of their weight is water), the **concentration of active compounds** is much higher by weight. For example, **1 gram of dried mushrooms** is roughly equivalent to **10 grams of fresh mushrooms** in terms of potency.\n- **Longer Shelf Life**: Dried mushrooms are much more **stable** than fresh mushrooms. When stored in an airtight container and kept away from moisture, light, and heat, dried mushrooms can retain their potency for extended periods (months to years).\n\n### 2. **Extraction Efficiency in an Alcohol-Based Cannabis Tincture**\n\nWhen submerged in an **alcohol-based tincture**, the extraction process is affected by whether you are using fresh or dried mushrooms.\n\n#### **Fresh Mushrooms in Alcohol Tincture**\n- **Lower Extraction Efficiency**: The high water content of fresh mushrooms can dilute the **alcohol concentration**, potentially leading to **less efficient extraction** of psilocybin and psilocin into the alcohol base. Alcohol is less effective as a solvent when water is present in large amounts.\n- **More Psilocin in the Extract**: Since fresh mushrooms have higher psilocin content, there might be more **psilocin** present in the tincture. However, if the tincture is not stored properly, psilocin may degrade over time, resulting in diminished potency.\n- **Possible Mold or Bacterial Growth**: Fresh mushrooms, with their higher water content, can potentially introduce moisture into the alcohol tincture, which could promote the growth of **mold or bacteria**, even in a high-alcohol environment. This could affect the tincture\u2019s safety and efficacy if not handled carefully.\n\n#### **Dried Mushrooms in Alcohol Tincture**\n- **Higher Extraction Efficiency**: Dried mushrooms allow for more efficient extraction of **psilocybin** and **psilocin** into the alcohol, as there is less water to dilute the alcohol. This leads to a more **potent extract**.\n- **More Psilocybin in the Extract**: Dried mushrooms are more likely to contribute higher levels of **psilocybin** into the tincture since psilocin degrades during the drying process. Psilocybin is more stable and thus would create a more consistent and long-lasting tincture.\n- **Stable and Long-Lasting Tincture**: Since dried mushrooms are more stable and have less water content, the tincture will likely have a **longer shelf life** with fewer risks of contamination from mold or bacterial growth.\n\n### 3. **Psychoactive Effects of Fresh vs. Dried Mushrooms**\n\nThe difference in the **psilocybin-to-psilocin ratio** between fresh and dried mushrooms can lead to different subjective experiences during consumption.\n\n#### **Fresh Mushrooms**\n- **More Immediate Onset**: Due to the higher **psilocin content**, the effects of fresh mushrooms can have a **quicker onset**, as psilocin is already present and doesn&#x27;t need to be metabolized from psilocybin. This can lead to **faster** and more intense early effects, including **visual distortions** and **euphoria**.\n- **Smoother Experience**: Some users report that the trip from fresh mushrooms feels **smoother** or more natural compared to dried mushrooms, potentially due to the balance between psilocybin and psilocin. There may also be more of the **&quot;body high&quot;** or **empathogenic** effects that psilocin can provide.\n- **Shorter Duration**: The experience with fresh mushrooms may have a **shorter duration**, as psilocin tends to be metabolized quickly. The peak effects may come on faster, but the overall trip may not last as long compared to dried mushrooms.\n\n#### **Dried Mushrooms**\n- **Slower Onset**: Since dried mushrooms contain more **psilocybin**, which needs to be converted into psilocin by the body, the onset of effects is typically **slower**. This can take around **30 to 60 minutes**, depending on metabolism and the method of consumption.\n- **Longer Duration**: The trip from dried mushrooms may last **longer**, as the body gradually converts psilocybin into psilocin over time. The effects may be **more sustained**, with a more gradual buildup and a longer plateau.\n- **More Intense Visuals**: Some users report that dried mushrooms provide more **intense visual experiences** compared to fresh mushrooms, potentially due to the slower buildup of psilocin in the brain over time.\n\n### 4. **Additional Considerations**\n\n- **Storage and Stability**: Dried mushrooms are much easier to store and keep potent for long periods, while fresh mushrooms need to be consumed quickly or stored under special conditions (such as refrigeration or freezing).\n- **Dosage Differences**: Because fresh mushrooms are **less potent by weight**, users need to consume larger quantities of fresh mushrooms to achieve the same effect as dried mushrooms. This could impact the method of consumption, especially in tinctures, where larger amounts of fresh mushrooms would need to be submerged to match the potency of a smaller amount of dried mushrooms.\n\n### Summary of Fresh vs. Dried Mushrooms\n\n| Aspect                   | Fresh Mushrooms                              | Dried Mushrooms                             |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Psilocybin Content**    | Lower (due to high water content)            | Higher (due to water loss)                  |\n| **Psilocin Content**      | Higher (more immediate effects)              | Lower (degrades during drying process)      |\n| **Potency by Weight**     | Less potent (due to water content)           | More potent (dried and concentrated)        |\n| **Extraction in Alcohol** | Less efficient (diluted by water content)    | More efficient extraction                   |\n| **Onset of Effects**      | Faster (psilocin is already present)         | Slower (psilocybin needs conversion)        |\n| **Duration of Effects**   | Shorter trip                                 | Longer, more sustained trip                 |\n| **Storage**               | Less stable (prone to mold, spoilage)        | More stable, longer shelf life              |\n\nIn summary, dried mushrooms are generally more **potent** and **stable**, with **longer-lasting** effects, while fresh mushrooms may offer **quicker onset** but shorter experiences, with a **smoother** feel due to higher psilocin content. In tinctures, dried mushrooms are preferred due to better **extraction efficiency** and **shelf stability**."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Each place I move to, it is a joy for me to explore the local culture and get to know the people. Reflecting on it, I\u2019m confident that growing up and switching between my parent&#x27;s homes in two different states gave me an appreciation for constantly changing environments and the adaptability to enjoy them.\r\n\tI moved to Minnesota to attend career training in 2004, and eventually, in 2012, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Metropolitan State University. The following year after graduating from university, I joined CSX railway in a managerial role. During my time with CSX railway,  I discovered my talents for relationship building, adaptability, and process improvement to be an essential element to successfully leading teams and reaching desired outcomes. \r\n\tAfter leaving CSX, I moved to Prague, Czech Republic, and became certified in teaching English as a foreign language. After earning my teaching certification, I began working with young learners aged 5-14.  It was here that I further developed my presentation and public speaking skills. I leveraged these talents to support my students and their parents in reaching their desired learning outcomes. Overall, it was immensely gratifying to find that by helping others reach their learning objectives through sharing my native language and culture, I also synergistically maximized my cultural immersion experience.\r\n\tAfter returning to the United States, I developed my professional skill set more.  I  worked in various industries, from software development to fire protection systems. However, my natural curiosity and dedication to continuous learning were always at the forefront, driving me toward discovering where my most extraordinary talents lie. \r\nDuring this time, I learned that I thrive on helping and supporting others and that my best tools to help others were through active listening and engagement. I also discovered that I am passionate about data-driven analytical thinking, regardless of industry or position. I believe this is always the best approach to finding innovative solutions. Finally, enthusiasm for an activity increases effectiveness; therefore, I approach every task enthusiastically for efficiency and success. Today, I am excited and enthusiastic to leverage these skills and talents in a customer success role where I\u2019ll be able to proactively support customers in reaching their desired outcomes while utilizing my vast array of talents to achieve organizational objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally from New York City, Alexis Lindsay began her professional career with Canadian Pacific Railway in 2005 as a Customer Service Operations Representative at their Minneapolis, Minnesota headquarters.

KEY STAKEHOLDERS\n\nEngagement and dialogue with stakeholders are crucial if a project\n\nis to become successful. Stakeholder engagement is the process of\n\ninteracting with actors involved in and impacted by a project. It is\n\nparticularly important to a project as its completion often depends\n\non how stakeholders see the project.\n\nVarious stakeholders are mobilized for this project, from the\n\nCoordinator and other staff working at the Mensa Giovanni Paolo\n\nII who are directly involved in the daily operations and\n\nmanagement of the establishment to the economically challenged\n\npersons who are the recipients of free meals provided by the\n\nMensa\u2019s feeding programme. In between are the different service\n\nproviders as well as range of volunteers involved in the project,\n\n1\n\n\n\nMaster in Project Management\n\nTrecce Project Charter\n\ni.e., volunteer chefs and servers, current partners supporting the\n\nfeeding programme (i.e., Comune di Roma and the local church)\n\nand new partners providing funds and other resources mobilized\n\nfor the project and the project team.\n\nDetails on the engagement of stakeholders in the project (list,\n\nrationale for their involvement, the different \u201casks\u201d, and strategy\n\nfor their involvement/participation are outlined in the Project\n\nManagement Plan and related Annexes.\n\n4.

Such a society naturally creates two groups: those who have\u2014and those who have not. Some believe that it is the ethical responsibility of the wealthy to support the poor. They think that a person doesn\u2019t become rich independently so the wealthy owe a debt to society.  In contrast others suggest that the poor need only to work harder to find success and become wealthy. They feel that taxing the rich more is almost like punishing a person for their success.\nIndeed even before the formation of our union the founding fathers debated what moral role and responsibility the wealthy have toward the less fortunate. For example Benjamin Franklin touted the virtues of self-reliance (Frey 2009). In Benjamin Franklin\u2019s The Way to Wealth initially published in the 1758 edition of Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack he allegorically points towards hard work and self-sufficiency as the keys to success while implying that the needy or impoverished need only to work harder to be successful. Furthermore Franklin (2009) asserted that \u201cwe are taxed twice as much by our idleness three times as much by our pride and four times as much by our folly and from these taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement\u201d (p. 5).\nIn contrast Thomas Jefferson\u2019s proposed \u201cBill for Support of the Poor\u201d dated June 18 1779 includes various provisions to ensure that the ill adolescent and poverty-stricken have food and shelter (Jefferson 1950 as cited in Founders Online n.d.). Moreover Jefferson (1950 as cited in Founders Online n.d.) proposed that these public welfare initiatives be paid by  \u201ctaxation of the persons and property in their county according to the mode of assessment prescribed by the law\u201d (para. 1). Thus from the provision and wording contained within the bill we can infer that Thomas Jefferson felt that landowners traditionally the wealthiest members of society should contribute more to help the less fortunate.\nIndeed the practice of taxing the wealthy to provide for the less fortunate continues today. For example on November 19 2021 the House approved President Biden\u2019s two trillion-dollar Build Back Better spending bill (Snell 2021). The legislation includes various measures to aid and support low- and middle-income households and tax hikes targeting the country\u2019s highest earners. \nOne of the bill\u2019s key measures that will enormously benefit poor and middle-class families is the extension and expansion of the child tax credit. According to the house majority leader website this action is projected to reduce child poverty from approximately 14% to 7.5% (Points to Know 2021). In addition the Build Better Act also includes provisions to lower prescription drug costs. Other features of the Build Back Better Act that provide economic support to poor and middle-class households is a national paid family leave policy and measures to lower the cost of child care (Points to Know 2021).\nHowever to balance out the increased spending on social and environmental issues several tax hikes were aimed toward the wealthy within the bill (Snell 2021). The bill includes an additional 5% surtax on those earning greater than $10 million per year (Vega 2021). In addition there is also a further 3% tax hike for those who make more than $25 million per year (Vega 2021).  Although President Biden and many other political pundits have long championed taxing the rich to support government social initiatives the topic has oft been hotly debated.\nWhile the Build Back Better spending bill has passed through Congress it has yet to pass the Senate. Some speculate that in its current form the legislation will not pass at all. However if the bill does pass in its current form the Senate will have to address questions like: What responsibility do the wealthy have to support the poor? Is one\u2019s economic outlook a reflection of one\u2019s effort? Is it ethical for the government to tax the rich more to benefit the poor and poverty-stricken?\n\tIn one of the most infamous bits of dialogue from 20th-century cinema a character from a film titled Wall Street proclaims \u201cgreed\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014is good\u201d (Eidenmuller n.d. para. 2). Of course in a capitalist society such as ours greed is good. By subscribing to a capitalist structure we have implicitly agreed that individual wealth creation is good for society as a whole (Otteson 2013). \n\tIngrained within our society is the concept that everything has a cost and nothing is free.  In the capitalist world of today even ideas or trademarked bought and sold. American ideals suggest that everything should be earned or purchased. Even things viewed in other countries as fundamental human rights such as adequate healthcare must be purchased here in the United States.\nAmerica promises that through hard work anything is possible. The rich have worked hard to amass and maintain their fortunes. Through their successes they create the conditions by which everyone can flourish. Rich and poor alike look to the government to protect their interests. \nTaxing those who earn more just because they make more to support the poor goes against the fundamental principles of capitalism and the social contract. It takes away from those who have earned their riches and gives them to those who haven\u2019t earned anything at all. The United States was founded on ideas of the common good where \u201cindividuals are equal and free to pursue their own interests\u201d (Mcmanus et al. 2018 p. 245).  How could it be ethical to formulate laws that are inherently unequal in their application? \nUnequal tax is equivalent to unequal protection. Moreover it sends the message that if one earns more one owes more to society. One can also say that taxing the rich more violates the spirit of equality within the social contract while hindering the free markets that capitalism demands.\nEveryone has an equal right to amass as much wealth as possible. However higher taxes on the rich violate their equal rights by demanding a higher share from the wealthy than the poor. Therefore the government increasing taxes on only the wealthiest is unethical because it violates the social contract and does not align with the capitalistic mindset of our society.\n\tOne of the most noteworthy aspects of social contract theory is the responsibilities both the state and its citizens owe to each other.  According to Mcmanus et al. (2018) under the conditions of social contract theory \u201cfor the protection of property men agree to delegate \u2013 or transfer \u2013 their rights to the government. The government safeguards the rights and property of its citizens\u201d (p. 199). Taxing the rich more than the poor is tantamount to failing to protect their property. \n\tIn fact these kinds of individual income tax surcharges are the opposite of protection. Higher taxes for higher income brackets while redistributing those funds to other members of the populace sends the message that government only protects the interest of some of its citizens. It discourages hard work and self-reliance. It encourages citizens to become lazy and purposeless dependents of the government.  Taxing the wealthy to support those in poverty creates a society whose members depend on the state to provide what they should be earning for themselves.\nFurthermore central to the idea of the social contract is the concept of reciprocity.  According to Mangoting et al. (2015) \u201cpeople will surrender their resources to state with a condition that the state also returns with the same amount\u201d (p. 968). However in the United States people who work and earn their wealth surrender their resources to the state to benefit those who do not work. In fact in the United States if a person makes more and has a greater ability to be financially independent that person may be required to contribute more to support benefits they will never receive.  Thus greater taxes for the rich to benefit the poor violate this premise: there is never a reciprocal return of these funds or benefits from the government. \nInstead of raising taxes on individuals who have worked hard to amass wealth we should first look to set regulations that protect the rights of citizens. Government should create an environment where individuals are allowed to flourish. For example the Build Back Better Act includes provisions for universal pre-K (Points to Know 2021).  This provision allows for all 3-4-year-olds to receive an education. As we are all created equal any inequalities stem from as Adam Smith suggested habit custom and education (Otteson 2013). \nFurthermore the government often raises taxes on individuals to pay for social initiatives when raising corporate tax rates would be more equitable. Right now the federal corporate income tax rate is 21% combined with varying state tax rates of up to 11.5%  (York 2021). It is also important to note that the United States has the largest gross domestic product (GDP) at approximately $21 trillion (United States of America - Place Explorer - Data Commons n.d.).  Just the slightest increase in corporate taxes could generate billions to improve the lives of each citizen.\nIn contrast to the United States currently France has the highest combined tax rate at 32% (York 2021) but with a much smaller GDP at $2.6 trillion (France | Data n.d.). In addition after loopholes and deductions the effective tax rate for most large corporations is relatively lower than that figure. Therefore instead of unevenly taxing individuals the government needs to tax corporations more and reduce loopholes.\nFor any social contract to work everyone needs to contribute their fair share. However fairness and equality are not always the same thing. Indeed many philosophical theories centered around fairness acknowledge that sometimes inequality is acceptable.\n For example according to Mcmanus et al. (2018)  in his Justice as Fairness theory John Rawls argued that inequality is acceptable if it benefits the least advantaged members of society. Because many of the factors that benefit the most privileged are unearned \u201cRawls argues that social stability requires us to benefit those who do not have the same advantage so that they are regarded as equally worthy members of the same society\u201d (p. 228). Therefore because it may benefit the least privileged members of society one could argue that higher taxes for the wealthy are just and fair even when viewed through social contract theory. \nA just society is \u201cgrounded in cooperation and mutual advantage between its individual members\u201d (Mcmanus et al. 2018 p. 201). Taxing the nation\u2019s highest earners helps to fund the government. The government is needed to maintain an ordered and safe society. The government is comprised of individuals.  Thus one could also argue that the government taxing the rich to support the less fortunate is an example of cooperation for mutual advantage. \nFinally higher taxes for the rich are arguably justifiable because not every wealthy person has earned their riches. Very often the most affluent citizens have benefitted from  \u201cthe accomplishments of past generations not to mention the support of public institutions (like the National Science Foundation) and services (like schools) that foster innovation and lead to greater productivity\u201d (Kohn 2010 para. 7). Therefore one could assert that the wealthy owe a debt to society and as they have gained more they should contribute more. \nHowever regardless of whether the government taxes the rich more or less the true source of immorality in this situation is capitalism itself. One of the main philosophical underpinnings of capitalism is the idea that \u201cman&#x27;s mind is competent in dealing with reality that it is morally good for each person to strive for his own happiness\u201d (Capitalism FAQ: Theory n.d.). However in reality capitalism creates a society where each person strives toward monetary rewards for themselves because that represents access to personal happiness. As a result capitalism perpetuates inequalities and encourages a competitive and divisive mindset which ultimately destabilizes society. Instead of encouraging humanity to work together for the betterment and progression of all we instead live our whole life attempting to amass and hoard wealth. \nLike our founding fathers the majority of Congress is wealthy. Today over half of the members of Congress are millionaires (Evers-Hillstrom 2020).  They depend on the donations from lobbyists funded by corporations to finance their campaigns. In the pursuit of their happiness they like us are working to earn a dollar. \nThe Build Back Better Act is now with the Senate. While there are hopes that the bill will pass before Christmas passing the bill in the Senate is expected to be an uphill battle. Many senators argue that its provisions are too costly and will negatively affect the economy (Reilly &amp; Cole 2021).  \nIn a just society  \u201cAccording to [John] Rawls leaders and followers must work together to guarantee the basic rights of those who cannot speak up for themselves\u201d (McManus et al. 2018 p. 242). However given the political climate of the day the personal wealth of the majority of Congress and the overarching influence of capitalism it is unlikely the bill will pass in its current form. More than likely some of the existing provisions to aid poor and median income households or the tax increases included in the legislature will be dropped before it is approved by the Senate (Reilly &amp; Cole 2021). \nIn America we citizens look to the state to support and relieve us from the inherent injustices and inequalities we experience while living in our capitalistic system. We expect government leaders to be the antithesis of greedy capitalists. We believe that they act ethically and never make decisions motivated by self-interest and personal gain. We hope that politicians make decisions with all citizens\u2019\u2014be they rich or poor\u2014best interests in mind. Our social contract imbues them with the power to choose how we use and distribute a resource of finite nature and availability\u2014money. \nIs it moral to tax the rich to support the poor? Ultimately its ethicality is irrelevant in a society underpinned by a system that creates and maintains a culture driven by scarcity and choice. Moreover any society where its leaders must consider rectifying one inequality with another inequality where greed and self-interest abound and are encouraged is innately immoral from conception.\n\t\nReferences\nCapitalism FAQ: Theory.

It\n\nwas developed based on acceptance of the related Project Charter and defines how this\n\nproject will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed. This PMP is addressed to all\n\nstakeholders, including the management team, all sponsors, and the project team. Trecce\n\naims to mobilize chefs and volunteers to take part in a month-long pilot event at Mensa\n\nGiovanni Paolo II to offer nutritious meals to the economically disadvantaged while\n\nreducing food waste and fostering community engagement. The name Trecce, meaning\n\nbraids in Italian, derives from the intertwined connection the kitchen, chefs, and\n\ncommunity will have during this project.\n\nPage 4 of 25\n\n\n\n1.2 ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS\n\nThe Assumption and Constraints matrix is a very crucial component of the Risk\n\nManagement Plan. It is very important in forecasting, which is important in building a\n\nproject vision, and identifying project deliverables. Constraints on the other hand could\n\nserve as potential risks if not well managed. The matrix can serve as a guide to the\n\nProject Management Team in identifying all known risks.\n\nPlease refer to the Assumption and Constraints matrix for a detailed description of all\n\nregistered project assumptions and constraints. The matrix can be found in the Risk\n\nManagement Plan folder.\n\nSee Annex 1:  Assumption and constraints\n\nPage 5 of 25\n\n\n\n2 SCOPE MANAGEMENT\n\n2.1 REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION\n\nThe requirements of Trecce include all needs to lead to a successful food service for\n\nbeneficiaries. These include acquiring the needed stakeholders, having an adequate\n\nlocation for food preparation and service, providing schedules to stakeholders, and the\n\nmeans to analyze program success.\n\n2.2 REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY MATRIX\n\nSee Annex 2: Requirements Traceability Matrix\n\n2.3 WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE\n\nThe Trecce Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) categorizes all work needed to complete\n\nthe project and represents 100% of the scope. The WBS is broken down into the\n\nfollowing format:\n\n1. Project Management\n\n1.1. Execution\n\n1.1.1. Communication Plan Execution\n\n1.1.2. Project Work Execution\n\n1.1.3.

Once completed, they will\n\nneed to email this form to the project management team, indicated in the project charter.\n\nAt that time, the project management team will review the request and determine if the\n\nchange is approved or denied, completing any research on the change as needed. If\n\napproved, the project management team will be responsible for informing the affected\n\nstakeholders and updating any related project documents such as the schedule, activity\n\nlist, risk register, responsibility assignment matrix, or any document the PM team deems\n\naffected. If the request is denied, the PM team should respond to the stakeholder who\n\nrequested the change, indicating the reason for the denial.\n\nSee Annex 5: Change Request Form\n\n2.4 PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\n\nThe project schedule has been broken into the following phases: planning, recruitment, a\n\nmonth of service, and a post-service-month evaluation. The timeline for each phase\n\ndiffers due to project work needs, the man hours needed to complete the phase, observed\n\nholidays in Rome, and being mindful of our external stakeholders&#x27; schedules.\n\nDuring the planning phase, the main tasks will include procurement of materials,\n\nscheduling for the month of service, and food kitchen logistics. The timeline for this\n\nphase starts three months before the month of service and will last until the end of\n\nSeptember. As chefs and partners will dictate planning details, a lot of the work in this\n\nphase will occur after recruitment.\n\nThe recruitment of partners has already started in September of 2022. As Trecce\n\nrelies on donors to fund the project, it is important to receive around 50% of our\n\ndonation goal before the kickoff meeting on May 2, 2023. Therefore, we felt the urgency\n\nto start requesting donations as soon as possible. The recruitment of chefs will start at\n\nthe project kickoff and last until June 30, 2023. Holding this recruitment early on allows\n\nfor the most preparation of schedules and planning. Volunteers will start to be recruited\n\nonce marketing materials are launched and can sign up all the way up to the month of\n\nservice.\n\nThe timeline for the month of service includes all activities needed to conduct a\n\ndinner service successfully. Dinner service days include Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and\n\nPage 8 of 25\n\n\n\nThursdays. The food delivery will take place on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays,\n\none day before the meal service, to ensure our chefs have time to properly inspect the\n\ndonated food, determine a menu, and request any food items that need to be bought to\n\ncomplete the meal.\n\nFor the post-service-month evaluation, the goal is to understand whether or not this\n\npilot program has been successful or not. The schedule includes time to hear the\n\nopinions of chefs, partners, volunteers, and beneficiaries to understand the program&#x27;s\n\npros and cons. Once all data is collected, the project management team will analyze this\n\ndata and compile a report stating their opinion.\n\n2.4.1 ACTIVITY LIST AND ATTRIBUTES\n\nThe Trecce activity list encompasses all activities that must be completed in order for\n\nthe project to be successful. These were developed from the Work Breakdown Structure\n\nand should include 100% of the project work. Included in the activity list are the activity\n\nID, activity Name, WBS ID, predecessor and successor activities, logical relationship\n\nindicators, leads/lags, the imposed deadline, and the location where the activity will take\n\nplace. The project management team is responsible for monitoring the activity list and\n\nmaking any necessary updates during the project lifecycle.\n\nSee Annex 7: Activity List\n\n2.4.2 MILESTONE LIST\n\nMilestone Deadline\n\nGaining committed donors to fund project at 50% 02/05/23\n\nMeeting recruitment requirements for chefs. 30/06/2023\n\nMeeting recruitment requirements for partners 30/06/2023\n\nMeeting recruitment requirements for volunteers 29/09/23\n\nThe first meal service 02/10/2023\n\nThe last meal service 31/10/2023\n\nAll expected feedback is collected for analysis 07/11/2023\n\nCompleting the follow-up phase tasks 15/11/2023\n\nSee Annex 8: Milestones\n\n2.4.3 PROJECT SCHEDULE\n\nSee Annex 6: ProjectLibre Gantt Chart\n\nSee Annex 7: Activity list\n\nPage 9 of 25\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1KEQKckZ4wXzWammYTsR6mjKu65fmn_an/view?usp=share_link\n\n\nSee Annex 3:  WBS Dictionary\n\nSee Annex 21: Day of Service Timeline\n\nPage 10 of 25\n\n\n\n3 COST MANAGEMENT\n\n3.1 BUDGET &amp; SCHEDULE OF EXPENSES\n\nAt the start of planning we assume that 50% of the project funding has been secured.\n\nFundraising activities will continue throughout the project. In addition, as this is a\n\ncharitable endeavor, the project management team has agreed to donate 60% of their\n\nsalary toward the project. The schedule of funding partners with donation amount, along\n\nwith a complete schedule of expenses and contingency funding amounts to be found in\n\nthe annex.\n\nSee Annex 9: Budget and Schedule of expenses\n\nPage 11 of 25\n\n\n\n4 PROCUREMENT AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\n4.1 PROCUREMENT AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN OVERVIEW\n\nThe Trecce Procurement Management Plan aims to define the project\u2019s procurement and\n\nquality management process. The plan will set out the procurement and quality\n\nmanagement guidelines, define the risks associated with the procurement and quality\n\nmanagement strategy, and suggest the strategy for mitigating those risks. Specifically,\n\nthe Procurement Management Plan will define the following:\n\n\u25cf Project procurement partners and donating partners\n\n\u25cf Quality and procurement work breakdown structures (WBSs)\n\n\u25cf Establishing partner deliverables and deadlines\n\n\u25cf Which items are to be procured via direct purchase, pricing, and timelines\n\n\u25cf Determining material costs \n\n\u25cf Risks associated with procurement management\n\n\u25cf How procurement risks will be mitigated\n\n\u25cf How procurement is coordinated with project scope, budget, and schedule \n\n\u25cf Inventory and Quality Assessment Log Template\n\n\u25cf Quality management criteria\n\n\u25cf Specify all constraints pertaining to procurement\n\n\u25cf Performance metrics for procurement activities\n\nPlease refer to Annex 10 for the complete Trecce Procurement and Quality Management\n\nPlan.\n\nSee Annex 10: Trecce - Procurement and Quality Management Plan\n\nSee Annex 11: Inventory and Quality Assessment Log\n\nPage 12 of 25\n\n\n\n5 PROJECT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Resource Management Plan defines the approach to identify, acquire, and manage\n\nthe human and physical resources needed for the Trecce project. Resources are key\n\ncomponents of any project. Therefore, successfully identifying all the required human\n\nand material resources required for this endeavor is fundamental. The Resource\n\nManagement Plan also encompasses the Team Charter, a key document that outlines\n\nteam members&#x27; roles and responsibilities, team values, agreements, and operating\n\nguidelines. Please refer to the Resource Management Plan for a detailed description of all\n\nresources identified, how they will be managed and utilized for project success, and all\n\nnecessary information on the Team Charter.\n\nSee Annex 12:  Project Resource Management Plan\n\n5.1 RESPONSIBILITY ASSIGNMENT MATRIX\n\nThe Responsibility Assignment Matrix is a key component of the Resource Management\n\nPlan, which is required to inform all project team members on the assignment of project\n\ntasks/activities. This matrix details each project work activity, clearly indicating the\n\nhuman resource responsible of performing specific project activity/s, who is accountable\n\nfor its success or failure, who is to be consulted before the activity is conducted, and who\n\nis to be informed. The Trecce Project Team chose the RASCI matrix as opposed to the\n\nRASCI matrix because of the support component in the former. The support component\n\nis vital to this project as this is a social endeavor based on humanitarian ideals; therefore,\n\nteamwork, collaboration, and support are highly emphasized for all stakeholders\n\ninvolved to boost the chances of project success. Please refer to the Responsibility\n\nAssignment Matrix for a detailed description of all project activities and assignments.\n\nSee Annex 13: RASCI Matrix\n\nPage 13 of 25\n\n\n\n6 PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT\n\nCommunication is critical in any project, not only for involving the stakeholders and\n\nincreasing stakeholder engagement but also to avoid potential mistakes caused by\n\nmiscommunication. For this project, we have established the following communicational\n\npillars that played a central role in our communication plan: transparency, to create a\n\nsafe space, clarity, and a safe approach to handling personal information. With these\n\npillars in mind, we have tried to communicate successfully with our target audience and\n\nall involved stakeholders. We have used a tailored approach to communicate with\n\nstakeholders, partners, volunteers, etc. This is accomplished through using different\n\ncommunication tools per group in order to communicate as well as possible. All the\n\nspecific information on which tactics and tools were used per group and a more detailed\n\nexplanation of our communication plan can be found in the following document.\n\nSee Annex 14: Communications Plan\n\n6.1 PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nIn the communication matrix, we have provided an overview of the outgoing\n\ncommunication stream. The table includes the information we provide, the recipient, the\n\ncommunication method, the frequency but also the person in charge of our project team.\n\nThe table also includes the assumptions and constraints we foresee for the information\n\nprovided.\n\nSee Annex 15: Communication Matrix\n\nSee Annex 22: Communication Pillars\n\nPage 14 of 25\n\n\n\n7 RISK MANAGEMENT AND REGISTER\n\nA project risk is any foreseen or unknown issue that can potentially have a positive or\n\nnegative impact on the project. The Trecce Project Team successfully worked with the\n\nrelevant stakeholders in identifying all known project risks. Mitigation strategies have\n\nbeen clearly defined in the risk matrix. Likewise, the recommended contingency action\n\nwill be utilized should the risk occur. Contingency plans have been put in place to\n\naddress any future unforeseen risk or residual risks. The importance of this matrix to\n\nproject success cannot be overemphasized, as risks can be quantified and calculated to\n\ndetermine the financial impact they could pose to the project. This tool is vital in tracking\n\nand managing all risks to mitigate, eliminate, or exploit any risk.\n\nSee Annex 16: Risk Register\n\n7.1 ISSUE LOG\n\nThe Issue Log is crucial during project execution to track and document all issues\n\nthat may arise during the course of the project. This matrix is important in detailing and\n\nassigning issues to individuals and setting a due date for the successful resolution of\n\nissues. This document will help the Trecce Project Team to monitor, assign, and solve\n\nissues before they potentially grow into constraints or risks for the project.\n\nSee Annex 17:  Issue Log matrix\n\nPage 15 of 25\n\n\n\n8 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\n\nEngagement and dialogue with stakeholders are crucial if a project is to become\n\nsuccessful. Stakeholder engagement is the process of interacting with actors involved in\n\nand impacted by a project. It is particularly important to a project as its completion often\n\ndepends on how stakeholders see the project.\n\nVarious stakeholders are mobilized for this project, from the Coordinator and other\n\nstaff working at the Mensa Giovanni Paolo II who are directly involved in the daily\n\noperations and management of the establishment to the economically challenged\n\npersons who are the recipients of free meals provided by the Mensa\u2019s feeding program.\n\nIn between are the different service providers as well as range of volunteers involved in\n\nthe project, i.e., volunteer chefs and servers, current partners supporting the feeding\n\nprogram (i.e., Comune di Roma and the local church) and new partners providing funds\n\nand other resources mobilized for the project and the project team.\n\nPage 16 of 25\n\n\n\n8.1 PROJECT TRECCE KEY STAKEHOLDERS\n\nMensa Caritas Diocesana &quot;Giovanni Paolo II&quot; Coordinator and staff. Carlo\n\nVirtu is Mensa&#x27;s Coordinator. As the key decision maker in Mensa, his leadership and\n\nbuy-in are crucial to successfully rolling out the project. At Mensa, he is responsible for\n\nCoordinating all activities of the Food Kitchen, reporting, and liaison with stakeholders.\n\nHe is ably supported by a team composed of an Assistant Coordinator (Simon\n\nEsuperanzi), an Administrative Officer (Massimo Ceccarelli), and a Cleaning/\n\nOrganization Staff (Brenda Longo). This team, in particular its Coordinator, is contacted\n\nand consulted right from the very start of the project where the Trecce Project concept\n\nwas presented. After listening to and taking into account their inputs, the overall project\n\nidea was revised, and from which the overall work plan and budget were developed. The\n\nteam is obviously very much involved in the pilot project implementation and in\n\nevaluating its effectiveness after completing the pilot phase. It is important that\n\ninteraction with this group is carried out in person, with clear agreements documented in\n\nwriting to avoid any misunderstanding and miscommunication.\n\nComune di Roma and Caritas Roma. As the two organizations supporting the\n\ncurrent feeding program at Mensa, it is important that the Trecce project builds on the\n\nongoing program they currently support. As with the Mensa team, both Comune and\n\nCaritas are contacted and consulted right from the very start of the project, where the\n\nTrecce Project concept was presented. Their inputs and suggestions are integrated into\n\nthe design of the project, and their full support moving forward was solicited. The Project\n\nteam assures the Comune and Caritas that the Trecce Project will build on the current\n\nfeeding program that they are supporting and that any changes to be made are only to\n\nimprove it. Regular and open communication, both verbal and written, takes place\n\nregularly, with meeting agreements documented.\n\nProject beneficiaries. The project is designed with the economically disadvantaged in\n\nmind, i.e., hundreds of people who rely on free meals provided by Mensa. But free meals\n\ndo not need to be less nutritious. Trecce Project is all about serving nutritious meals\n\nprepared by volunteer chefs/student chefs. Feedback from the beneficiaries will be\n\nsolicited verbally during or right after each meal service.\n\nPage 17 of 25\n\n\n\nFood transport service provider. Transport provider LogTech SRL is mobilized to\n\nensure timely delivery of food items/ingredients, either donated or purchased. They are\n\nbriefed as regards the project, emphasizing the critical role they play in avoiding delays\n\nand smooth execution of daily plans.\n\nToo Good To Go, Glovo, and Food for Good. These partners are all engaged in\n\nreducing food waste and in making nutritious food accessible. Trecce project partners\n\nwith them to provide ready meals to the Trecce project in case of insufficient meals\n\nduring project execution. Also, should there be excess food items prepared, they are also\n\nmobilized to deliver to other individuals or other charities in Rome. Terms of\n\ncollaboration with these partners are spelled out in a Partnership Agreement which is\n\ndiscussed and agreed upon with them following the presentation and discussion of the\n\nTrecce Project prior to its kickoff.\n\nPartner chefs, Culinary Schools, and Chef associations. There is no shortage of\n\nfood practitioners in Rome. Foremost of these are various restaurant chefs, culinary\n\nschools, and chef associations in the city. With thousands of members among\n\nprofessional chefs and restaurateurs (in the case of associations) and future chefs and\n\nteachers (in the case of culinary schools), these establishments is a rich pool of volunteer\n\nchefs, teachers, and students whose values and passion are fully aligned with the\n\nphilosophy of the Trecce project, i.e., making nutritious food available while reducing\n\nfood loss and waste. Chef associations are solicited to entice and encourage their member\n\nchefs to volunteer for the program and cook meals for the project beneficiaries.\n\nRestaurant chefs who are not members of any of the associations are also approached to\n\nvolunteer as well. In the case of culinary schools, a special arrangement is explored\n\nwhere the involvement of the culinary students in the project can be counted and\n\nvalidated as part of their community immersion and practices within their own\n\ncurriculum. The Trecce Project will be pitched to these establishments and individuals.\n\nTerms of collaboration are spelled out in a Partnership Agreement that will be discussed\n\nand signed among the parties concerned.\n\nPartner foundations. Foundations are private entities serving public goals. Prospect\n\nresearch was carried out to identify private foundations in Rome whose mission and\n\nobjectives are aligned with the Trecce Project objectives. The various foundations\n\nPage 18 of 25\n\n\n\nidentified as partners for the project operate in Rome, promoting and supporting causes\n\nsuch as community welfare and social inclusion (e.g., ACRI), families and people in\n\neconomic difficulty, migrants and refugees (e.g., Enel Cuore Onlus), health and aid to the\n\nunderprivileged (e.g., Fondazione di Roma), and food security (e.g., Coldiretti). These\n\ninstitutions will be requested, following a pitch for support, to contribute financial\n\nresources to cover the cost of ingredients (should there not be sufficient leftovers from\n\nthe restaurant of volunteer chefs) and project operations (transport, publicity, etc.).\n\nPartner supermarkets. Italy has a law that will make supermarkets donate more of\n\ntheir waste food to charities. The Trecce project will build on this law by soliciting\n\npartner supermarkets (Conad, Coop, Carrefour, Tuodis) to donate unsold perishable\n\nitems (e.g., fruits, vegetables, and other ingredients) that are still suitable for\n\nconsumption through the project. This contributes to minimizing their waste while\n\nimproving their community involvement and enhancing their corporate social\n\nresponsibility. The supermarket branches identified are those within close vicinity of the\n\nMensa in order to minimize transport but also for further visibility of the supermarket as\n\nwell. The Trecce project will be presented to the management of the supermarket\n\nbranches identified. The terms and conditions of their involvement are specified in a\n\nPartnership Agreement that is discussed, agreed upon, and signed by concerned parties.\n\nVolunteer servers. Trecce Project will rely on a set of volunteer servers of different\n\nprofiles building on their high level of social and ecological awareness and sense of\n\nservice (Profile 1); on their interest to spend available and gain insights from their\n\nexperience while at the same time giving them a sense of worth through this community\n\nengagement work (Profile 2); and on their curiosity to discover and know the other side\n\nof Rome while giving them an opportunity to be part of a community. They will be\n\nrecruited to augment human power needs to help in the preparation and cleaning of the\n\nvenue, keep order during meal service, and accompany/talk with the beneficiaries. As\n\noutlined in the Communication Plan, teasers/flyers with details on how to volunteer are\n\nprepared and posted around Rome. A briefing/orientation session will be organized and\n\nconducted. Volunteer Agreement/Consent that spells out the work that needs to be\n\ncarried out, roles and responsibilities as volunteer servers, as well as service schedules,\n\nare prepared, presented, and discussed with the volunteers.\n\nPage 19 of 25\n\n\n\nVisibility/outreach partners (SDG2Hub, Eataly, Mercato Centrale Roma).\n\nTrecce Project also aspires to inspire other cities to come up with similar initiatives. To\n\nthis end, partners with advocacy groups (e.g., SDG2Hub) will be mobilized for further\n\nvisibility. Likewise, the participation of establishments with high potential for local\n\noutreach for volunteers inc. stall owners/cooks, and individual donors (e.g., Eataly,\n\nMercato Centrale Roma) will be sought to contribute to the project as well in terms of\n\nproviding space to display initiative&#x27;s poster (if appropriate); providing connections to\n\nsolicit chef volunteers; but also to collect any unused ingredients from the restaurant(s)\n\noperating in their establishment. As with other partners, the involvement of these\n\ninstitutions will be requested, following a pitch for support process.\n\nAcross all stakeholders involved, feedback shall be solicited in various ways (via\n\nsurvey, phone, or in-person conversation) for further improvement as well as to assess\n\npossible follow-up/next steps. Also, issues and disagreements, should they arise, shall be\n\nsettled amicably by the parties concerned. Finally, the contribution of all partners is\n\nacknowledged and recognized through posters displayed during meal service (e.g., \u201cThis\n\nevening\u2019s/week&#x27;s meal is supported/brought to you by Partner XYZ\u201d).\n\nThe detailed list of these stakeholders, the rationale for their involvement, and their\n\nspecific involvement/participation in the project are presented as Annexes of this\n\ndocument.\n\n8.2 STAKEHOLDER REGISTER, STAKEHOLDER MAP, STAKEHOLDER\n\nENGAGEMENT ASSESSMENT MATRIX AND STAKEHOLDER\n\nENGAGEMENT PLAN\n\nSee Annex 18: STH Register\n\nSee Annex 19: STH Engagement Assess.
