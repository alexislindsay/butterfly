As they\n\nconsider transferring their wealth, they are questioning their\n\nbeneficiaries\u2019 relationships with money and what will become of\n\ntheir nest egg.\n\nTake, for instance, the story of a family I know. Nathan and his\n\nwife, Ann, have been married 30 years. Over the years, they have\n\ndebated when they should tell their daughter, Morgan, about their\n\nwealth. The couple was concerned that learning about their wealth\n\ncould limit Morgan\u2019s ambition. Now that Morgan has established\n\nher career, Nathan and Ann are more comfortable discussing their\n\nestate. However, they cannot assume their daughter\u2019s values related\n\nto money are the same as theirs.\n\nNathan is from a family that experienced financial hardship his\n\ndaughter wasn\u2019t fully aware of growing up. However, Ann grew up\n\nmiddle class and had less fear of losing assets or being financially\n\ninsecure.\n\nAfter much agony, the couple had the talk with their daughter.\n\nNathan said the discussion went well and allowed him and his wife\n\nto share their experiences related to money growing up. Morgan left\n\nthe meeting understanding why her parents took various\n\napproaches to spending and building wealth, as well as how their\n\nlegacy should continue. The conversation also inspired her husband\n\nto have a conversation with his parents.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t done so, take time to think about your relationship\n\nwith money and how it was formed. Also, confirm that your\n\n\n\nchildren have a positive relationship with it. Key questions you\n\nshould ask yourself include:\n\n\u2022 Where do my money values come from?\n\n\u2022 Does money make me feel confident or insecure?\n\n\u2022 Do I have a history of making good financial decisions, and if not,\n\nwhy?\n\n\u2022 Am I hesitant to take action when there are issues regarding\n\nmoney?\n\n\u2022 Am I impulsive with money, or do I have the discipline to say no?\n\n\u2022 Do my children have good values with money, especially if they\n\nwill inherit it from me?\n\nIf thinking about these questions makes you feel uncomfortable,\n\nyou might not have a good relationship with money. If you do not\n\nhave a healthy relationship with it, consider consulting with a\n\nfinancial advisor to develop a strategy to correct the financial path\n\nfor you and your family. Financial health contributes to overall\n\nhealth and a better quality of life.\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial\n\nadvice.

https://www.youtube.com/watch/SUvoBzjZv7E\n\n00:00:00.410 [Music]\n00:00:15.260 I&#x27;m here today to talk about fundraising\n00:00:18.050 or as you probably think of it the other\n00:00:20.550 F word because if you want to change the\n00:00:24.210 world you have to know how to pay for it\n00:00:25.710 I&#x27;m not talking about being a good\n00:00:27.570 person you can do that for free I&#x27;m\n00:00:29.599 talking about if you want to create\n00:00:31.619 something start something galvanize a\n00:00:34.649 community\n00:00:35.520 improve the lives of others run for\n00:00:37.050 office every day great ideas die on the\n00:00:40.440 vine because they don&#x27;t have capital to\n00:00:41.910 get off the ground and all of the work\n00:00:44.100 the thought the vision that goes into\n00:00:46.350 the idea isn&#x27;t worth much if you can&#x27;t\n00:00:48.450 pay your bills and while most of the\n00:00:50.760 greatest social movements in history\n00:00:52.170 were powered purely by an idea and\n00:00:55.050 people&#x27;s belief in that idea real change\n00:00:57.930 in impact require resources real people\n00:01:02.520 do this work they need real change real\n00:01:05.880 impact and resources to actually make it\n00:01:08.670 happen the people that believe in this\n00:01:10.830 work have to have the support and the\n00:01:12.840 resources to do it that&#x27;s where I come\n00:01:15.930 in I get essential resources into the\n00:01:18.150 hands of people and visionaries on the\n00:01:20.430 front lines doing work that matters we\n00:01:23.400 spend the majority of our waking hours\n00:01:24.990 working we spend more time working than\n00:01:27.210 we do with our loved ones so I decided\n00:01:29.490 early on that I have to love my work and\n00:01:31.259 it has to add value and while I would\n00:01:34.530 love to be one of these people who\n00:01:36.240 spearheads you know social change from\n00:01:39.000 the ground up and the thing I realized\n00:01:41.220 early on in my nonprofit career is that\n00:01:43.619 the thing I&#x27;m good at the thing I&#x27;m\n00:01:45.570 really good at is raising money and I\n00:01:49.140 love it I think it is a privilege to\n00:01:51.570 work alongside bold ambitious optimistic\n00:01:55.049 leaders and the organizations they serve\n00:01:56.869 so I teach people how to do the thing\n00:01:59.369 I&#x27;m good at because the more people that\n00:02:01.469 learn how to be good at my end of this\n00:02:03.240 work the more work will get done and I\n00:02:06.119 teach everyone I teach CEOs and\n00:02:09.209 presidents and boards of directors and\n00:02:12.020 Didi&#x27;s I teach development directors and\n00:02:15.110 all sorts of teams and nonprofit newbies\n00:02:17.740 social change agents and candidates I\n00:02:20.510 teach anyone that wants to do something\n00:02:22.640 extraordinary how to fund their dream my\n00:02:25.490 dream is that there will be more people\n00:02:26.750 like me doing this work well and that\n00:02:29.330 development will be an undergraduate\n00:02:30.650 course at universities so that\n00:02:32.330 fundraising animals like me will find\n00:02:35.510 this job out of the gate instead of\n00:02:37.070 discovering it years later accidentally\n00:02:38.960 I even have the curriculum developed but\n00:02:41.210 short of overhauling undergraduate\n00:02:43.010 course requirements I think tonight&#x27;s\n00:02:45.530 probably a good first step to get people\n00:02:47.510 to think about fundraising more as an\n00:02:50.690 opportunity and less as a dirty word if\n00:02:54.260 you want to change the world you have to\n00:02:56.240 know how to pay for it to do that well\n00:02:58.580 you have to understand three big things\n00:03:00.140 your feelings about wealth and money the\n00:03:03.860 importance of building relationships and\n00:03:05.870 how to ask for what you want let&#x27;s start\n00:03:09.350 at the top your feelings about wealth\n00:03:10.820 and money what is your relationship to\n00:03:13.160 money money is complicated it makes\n00:03:16.640 everyone squeamish it makes everyone act\n00:03:18.650 kind of weird anyone who&#x27;s ever had to\n00:03:20.930 split the check after dinner with\n00:03:22.400 friends can tell you this and imagine\n00:03:24.320 what it was like you know before venmo\n00:03:27.910 to help people learn how to raise money\n00:03:30.530 you have to help them understand their\n00:03:32.060 deal with money because everybody has\n00:03:33.590 baggage grow up poor baggage grow up\n00:03:36.920 rich baggage mad or envious that other\n00:03:40.160 people have more money than you baggage\n00:03:42.290 I think people with money are smarter\n00:03:44.810 than you\n00:03:45.970 baggage feel guilty that you have more\n00:03:49.970 money than other people that&#x27;s some\n00:03:52.220 first-class baggage\n00:03:55.349 still baggage people it&#x27;s still baggage\n00:03:57.629 so whatever your deal is with your\n00:04:00.659 baggage you have to reconcile it if\n00:04:02.129 you&#x27;re gonna be able to ask for money\n00:04:03.209 and here&#x27;s a little tip about asking\n00:04:05.280 people for money\n00:04:05.999 the only difference about really wealthy\n00:04:08.340 people in us is that they have more\n00:04:10.379 money than us that&#x27;s it\n00:04:12.750 don&#x27;t overcomplicate it they come with\n00:04:15.569 their own baggage when you think about\n00:04:19.168 how to do this work it&#x27;s important to\n00:04:21.839 remember that money makes the world go\n00:04:24.000 around you hear that all the time but\n00:04:25.320 it&#x27;s true whether you&#x27;re a non-profit\n00:04:26.490 for a profit or you pay your own bills\n00:04:28.729 we often feel like talking about it is\n00:04:31.380 this icky embarrassing ugly thing but\n00:04:34.139 it&#x27;s just money and it&#x27;s a fact of life\n00:04:36.810 so how you feel about it directly\n00:04:38.880 affects how you approach it like\n00:04:41.099 everyone else when I started out in this\n00:04:42.930 work I had to examine and understand my\n00:04:46.410 own feelings about wealth and money and\n00:04:48.210 I had to learn how to separate them from\n00:04:50.400 how I feel about raising money for\n00:04:52.110 important causes how I feel about asking\n00:04:54.900 for money to help people do good work in\n00:04:56.940 the world is not the same as how I feel\n00:04:58.949 about asking for money for myself this\n00:05:01.380 is an important distinction when I go\n00:05:04.139 and talk to someone I&#x27;m not asking them\n00:05:06.150 to pay my mortgage I&#x27;m giving them an\n00:05:08.909 opportunity to invest an idea that&#x27;s\n00:05:11.460 gonna change the world for the better\n00:05:12.990 why should I feel bad about that the\n00:05:16.320 answer is that I shouldn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t\n00:05:18.030 feel bad about giving them the inside\n00:05:19.620 tip on a hot stock and I&#x27;m not gonna\n00:05:21.870 feel bad about giving them the inside\n00:05:23.520 tip on empowering social change either\n00:05:25.440 if you want to be good at raising money\n00:05:28.139 you have to be able to reframe the ask\n00:05:30.270 both for yourself and for other people\n00:05:32.310 as an opportunity next you have to get\n00:05:36.360 prepared to build some relationships\n00:05:38.120 people give to people they don&#x27;t just\n00:05:40.349 give to ideas and if they don&#x27;t believe\n00:05:42.960 in the person running the place you&#x27;re\n00:05:44.190 already dead in the water this is true\n00:05:46.289 whether you&#x27;re in stocks or venture\n00:05:48.780 capital politics or nonprofits building\n00:05:52.889 a relationship with people takes work\n00:05:54.979 you have to care about more than just\n00:05:57.479 what you want or need you have to also\n00:05:59.490 value what someone else wants or need I\n00:06:01.590 know it&#x27;s a shocking terrible idea but\n00:06:04.800 oftentimes closing gifts is\n00:06:07.010 understanding the person more\n00:06:08.820 it&#x27;s important to know the product and\n00:06:10.380 if you think building a relationship\n00:06:11.910 with with people takes work building a\n00:06:14.610 relationship with someone you&#x27;re asking\n00:06:16.200 for money from takes work and it takes\n00:06:19.710 homework have you done any research do\n00:06:23.160 you have any idea what they care about\n00:06:24.600 do you know why they should invest in\n00:06:26.850 your work can you answer that question\n00:06:29.040 in less than 30 seconds if you can&#x27;t the\n00:06:31.140 meetings gonna be it&#x27;s gonna be pretty\n00:06:32.790 rough and the answer can&#x27;t be because\n00:06:34.650 they&#x27;re super rich and they live in your\n00:06:36.030 zip code when you talk to people and\n00:06:40.860 understand what they care about it has\n00:06:43.170 to be in person fundraising is\n00:06:45.270 relational it&#x27;s not transactional and\n00:06:47.400 you have to ask them questions when I\n00:06:50.850 sit down with the donor it goes\n00:06:52.140 something like this hi thanks so much\n00:06:55.560 for seeing me how have you been\n00:06:57.240 did you guys go anywhere fun over\n00:06:58.410 holiday nice I love Mexico do you always\n00:07:00.750 go to the same place oh that&#x27;s awesome\n00:07:02.670 are those your kids they&#x27;re so cute how\n00:07:04.950 old are they where are they in school oh\n00:07:07.140 that&#x27;s a great school are you guys very\n00:07:08.820 involved there your spouse is on the\n00:07:10.680 board how&#x27;s that I bet it&#x27;s a ton of\n00:07:12.180 work how do you guys meet oh it&#x27;s Santa\n00:07:14.250 Clara that&#x27;s awesome are you super\n00:07:15.870 involved in the alumni network oh that&#x27;s\n00:07:17.790 so interesting where do you guys live\n00:07:19.290 again oh that&#x27;s great is that your boat\n00:07:22.990 I literally go through all of these\n00:07:26.590 things right and you know why because\n00:07:27.910 guess what I know now I know they&#x27;re out\n00:07:30.009 a hundred and twenty grand a year in\n00:07:31.449 schooling for the next 12 years right\n00:07:33.550 spouse is on the board of the kids\n00:07:35.410 school I know they&#x27;re out 100k probably\n00:07:37.449 that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a six-figure they&#x27;re both\n00:07:39.520 involved in their school alumni and\n00:07:40.990 that&#x27;s probably 25k they told me they\n00:07:43.270 live on the Upper East Side I could look\n00:07:44.830 up their apartment online and I can find\n00:07:46.660 out what their mortgages and I know they\n00:07:48.789 own a second home in Mexico oh and they\n00:07:51.069 own a boat which is like funny money\n00:07:53.800 right so what I now understand is true\n00:07:59.139 what I now understand is their thousand\n00:08:02.229 dollar gift is probably more of a\n00:08:04.000 starter gift and I should be thinking\n00:08:06.160 about ways to to help them partner with\n00:08:09.639 us and invest in a more meaningful way I\n00:08:12.030 know this sounds a tad mercenary I&#x27;m not\n00:08:15.940 confused about how it sounds but here&#x27;s\n00:08:19.360 what I want to tell you because this is\n00:08:20.680 the part that all my clients always want\n00:08:22.509 to skip because they think it&#x27;s the\n00:08:23.680 fluff and it&#x27;s not important if you\n00:08:26.680 don&#x27;t understand what they care about\n00:08:28.150 and what they value how are you ever\n00:08:30.550 gonna be able to tell them about your\n00:08:31.900 work right I want them to fund our work\n00:08:34.510 I do but I also want them to have a\n00:08:37.089 really meaningful experience as a donor\n00:08:39.130 so that they feel like we&#x27;re partners\n00:08:41.200 and not they&#x27;re not an ATM right so it&#x27;s\n00:08:45.550 important to ask the questions because\n00:08:47.260 the more you know about them and you\n00:08:48.940 know what they value the more you can\n00:08:50.709 steer the conversation in a direction\n00:08:52.480 about your work that will resonate for\n00:08:54.010 them and once you get past the get to\n00:08:56.020 know you part you get into the fun stuff\n00:08:58.000 like why are you philanthropic at all\n00:09:00.610 right why do you invest in new ideas do\n00:09:05.380 you want giving back to be a value you\n00:09:07.180 pass on to your children can we help you\n00:09:09.100 do that it&#x27;s really awesome it&#x27;s\n00:09:12.040 meaningful and remember it&#x27;s a\n00:09:13.149 conversation it&#x27;s not a\n00:09:14.709 cross-examination it&#x27;s not an interview\n00:09:17.520 don&#x27;t walk in there and tell them\n00:09:19.810 everything you already know about them\n00:09:21.130 because you did your research you don&#x27;t\n00:09:22.240 get extra points for knowing how to use\n00:09:23.620 Google it&#x27;s 75% them talking 25% you\n00:09:29.170 listening it&#x27;s better to be a good\n00:09:30.910 listener than a good showman and once\n00:09:33.070 you understand what they care about you\n00:09:35.740 can talk to them\n00:09:36.580 what you care about right you can tell\n00:09:38.290 them about you now when you do this\n00:09:40.450 don&#x27;t get too deep into the weeds or\n00:09:42.820 you&#x27;ll lose them it&#x27;s a lot like when I\n00:09:45.040 sit down with guys in finance right and\n00:09:47.200 I say you know how&#x27;s work I&#x27;m looking\n00:09:50.800 for like a thumbs-up thumbs-down but\n00:09:53.589 what I get sometimes is like a long just\n00:10:00.360 description of how the markets are\n00:10:02.649 trending and my brain leaves my body and\n00:10:05.620 starts to think about what time I dry\n00:10:07.510 cleaner closes like I don&#x27;t have\n00:10:10.209 capacity for that and they don&#x27;t have\n00:10:12.310 capacity for that level detail of our\n00:10:13.990 work if they want it they&#x27;ll ask you the\n00:10:15.700 questions it&#x27;s it&#x27;s this this thing that\n00:10:19.570 happens over and over because I here&#x27;s\n00:10:22.120 an example I worked with the CEO once\n00:10:24.490 and I was hired to teach him how to talk\n00:10:26.440 to human people like a human person it\n00:10:30.070 was a very difficult job so he kept\n00:10:33.700 getting great donor meetings and he\n00:10:35.589 wasn&#x27;t closing any gifts and I could not\n00:10:37.899 figure out what the problem was so\n00:10:39.190 finally I was like I&#x27;m just gonna come\n00:10:40.630 with you it&#x27;s gonna be great\n00:10:41.709 so I went with him to meetings and what\n00:10:44.079 would happen was he was getting into\n00:10:45.490 such detail with the donors that their\n00:10:47.950 eyes were glazing over and then after he\n00:10:50.649 was done with his 15 minute pitch they\n00:10:53.560 literally would say this happened like\n00:10:55.300 three times in a row god that sounds\n00:10:57.910 great congratulations keep up the good\n00:11:00.790 work and that was the meeting which was\n00:11:02.620 obviously not the outcome we were\n00:11:03.850 looking for so he couldn&#x27;t understand\n00:11:06.370 what I was trying to say to him that I\n00:11:07.570 finally like in an act of sheer\n00:11:09.100 desperation was like you know what I\n00:11:13.029 love I love NASA\n00:11:15.970 I love NASA I think it is unbelievably\n00:11:20.649 amazing we have figured out how to get a\n00:11:22.510 person to the moon I think it&#x27;s awesome\n00:11:25.180 I think the idea of getting someone to\n00:11:28.510 the moon and they walk on the moon and\n00:11:30.149 god I love rocket ships I love rocket\n00:11:33.370 ships rocket ships are amazing but if\n00:11:35.769 you start to tell me about the rocket\n00:11:37.360 ship and how it gets to the moon and the\n00:11:39.430 math and the science equations on how\n00:11:41.500 the rocket ship gets to the moon I\n00:11:43.199 promise you I will hang myself with my\n00:11:45.699 own hair\n00:11:47.630 I was like that is not how you tell\n00:11:50.720 people about your work what is the need\n00:11:53.470 like what&#x27;s the point right how do you\n00:11:56.329 address the need why are you better at\n00:11:58.130 it than anybody else and what can they\n00:12:00.139 do to be what can you do to make it\n00:12:02.269 about them right how can they help you\n00:12:05.329 get to the moon that&#x27;s the good stuff if\n00:12:08.990 you&#x27;re able to do that you&#x27;re probably\n00:12:10.190 ready to make the ask now I don&#x27;t expect\n00:12:13.190 everyone to be super excited to ask\n00:12:15.170 people for money\n00:12:15.980 that&#x27;s why development is an actual\n00:12:17.899 profession and not an awkward hobby\n00:12:20.889 naturally great fundraisers love people\n00:12:24.350 they can and will talk to anyone they\n00:12:27.259 can find common ground with anyone\n00:12:29.060 they&#x27;re your friends that talk to people\n00:12:30.709 in the elevator or at the grocery store\n00:12:33.730 they believe in the work required to\n00:12:37.610 both build relationships and keep them\n00:12:39.680 and they naturally have a high tolerance\n00:12:43.759 for rejection but I don&#x27;t expect\n00:12:46.250 everyone to be a natural and you don&#x27;t\n00:12:47.810 have to be a natural to raise money you\n00:12:49.880 just have to respect the people in the\n00:12:52.250 process\n00:12:52.819 and do the work will you reconcile your\n00:12:57.889 baggage will you commit to build\n00:13:00.259 relationships if you will you&#x27;re ready\n00:13:02.689 to make the ask and the ask is\n00:13:04.850 oftentimes as simple as using the phrase\n00:13:06.860 would you consider would you consider\n00:13:09.769 becoming a monthly donor would you\n00:13:11.930 consider increasing your support to $100\n00:13:14.540 would you consider investing in our work\n00:13:16.759 at the $1,000,000 level would you\n00:13:19.370 consider does a couple of awesome things\n00:13:21.410 one it gives the donor and easy way to\n00:13:23.389 out like they can say no without it\n00:13:25.220 being yes now and to gives you a second\n00:13:27.949 ask well what would you consider\n00:13:31.269 it&#x27;s good right when you do this\n00:13:35.990 remember you&#x27;re not asking for yourself\n00:13:38.240 you&#x27;re asking on behalf of all of the\n00:13:39.920 people you serve or are touched by your\n00:13:42.139 genius this isn&#x27;t a personal favor right\n00:13:45.380 feel proud of the ask it&#x27;s incredible\n00:13:47.930 that you do this work

are grown-ups they have\n00:15:00.410 all the power in this situation they can\n00:15:02.839 answer the question don&#x27;t take it back\n00:15:05.110 which brings me to my favorite don&#x27;t ask\n00:15:08.209 don&#x27;t get if you don&#x27;t make an actual\n00:15:10.699 ask no one will give you actual money\n00:15:12.769 and if no one gives you actual and money\n00:15:14.870 you actually

for\n00:15:24.680 money to do important work that will\n00:15:27.529 change people&#x27;s lives I would love to\n00:15:29.839 not have to teach people how to make a\n00:15:31.399 case for the importance of feeding and\n00:15:33.649 housing and educating people but this is\n00:15:36.800 the world that we live in and if we&#x27;re\n00:15:38.240 committed to doing this work and

Hall\nUniversity of Florida, Gainesville,\nFlorida, USA\n\nThis article considers the importance of relationship building to community col-\n\nlege resource development efforts. It draws on concepts and theories from the \u00fcelds\n\nof public relations, fund raising, and higher education to demonstrate that stra-\n\ntegic management of relationships is a foundation of a successful resource devel-\n\nopment effort. This article discusses the conceptual link between fund raising and\n\nrelationship building. Characteristics of relationships, including trust, mutuality\n\nof control, satisfaction, and commitment are discussed, as are two types of re-\n\nlationships colleges have with their various publics: exchange and communal.\n\nImplications for practice and for future research in this area are provided. The\n\narticle concludes that because community colleges have a tradition of building\n\nclose working relationships with key organizations, institutions, and individuals\n\nin their communities, the colleges are well positioned for receiving increased levels\n\nof private support.\n\nAs the need for private support has increased at community colleges,\nGlass and Jackson (1998a; 1998b) and Jackson and Glass (2000) have\nprovided clear and insightful guidance for college leaders. They have\ndemonstrated the importance of integrating institutional planning\ninto resource development efforts, speci\ufffded the role of the president as\nthe leader of the resource development team (Glass &amp; Jackson, 1998b),\nand discussed the emerging trends and critical issues that affect fund\nraising (Jackson &amp; Glass, 2000). Resource development efforts also can\nbene\ufffdt from the well-established relationships that most community\ncolleges, their presidents, and others leaders have with key con-\nstituent groups and with in\ufffduential individual members of their\ncommunities.\n\nCommunity colleges traditionally have placed a high value on the\nestablishment of strong relationships with their communities.\n\nAddress Correspondence to Dr. Margarete Rooney Hall, University of Florida, P.O.\nBox 118400, Weimer Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611-8400, USA.

One of the two community college\npresidents quoted by Duronio and Loessin (1991) in Effective Fund\n\nRaising in Higher Education described his fundraising plans\nby saying:\n\nWe opened our library to the community. . . . Seven thousand people in\nthe community used the library last year. We haven\u2019t asked them for a\ndonation. About 80,000 people attended events in our theater last year.\nWe\u2019ve never asked them for a gift. For a program in our new \ufffdtness\ncenter, we anticipated that about 200 people would enroll, but 550\nregistered in the fall and 475 registered in the winter. Those are people\nin the community who pay $30 for use of this wonderful modern facility\nfor a full eleven weeks. What a bargain! We ought to be building on those\ncommunity ties. (p. 190)\n\nThe other president quoted said that \u2018\u2018he spends most of his fund-\nraising time talking to donors about their previous gifts, actual\ndevelopments on campus as a result of their earlier support, and\ncontinuing opportunities for donors to enrich (the) college\u2019\u2019 (Duronio &amp;\nLoessin, p. 180).\n\nEach of these presidents described a relationship between the col-\nlege and key members of the community. Each implied that\nstrengthening the relationship between the college and key members\nof the community would increase private \ufffdnancial support. The re-\nlationships they described vary. In the \ufffdrst case, the president focused\nmore on the fair exchange of support for excellent services and pro-\nducts. In the second, the president described a relationship that was\nless about a current exchange. He described a type of stewardship that\nlinked donors\u2019 past support not just to the immediate results it pro-\nduced for them, but also to the long-term success of the mission, stu-\ndents, and programs the donors cared about.\n\nDonors, too, have described their giving to a particular community\ncollege in terms of their relationship to that college. For example,\nAllen and Isabelle Leepa gave a $19 million art collection to St. Pe-\ntersburg Junior College. Leepa described their thinking this way: \u2018\u2018We\nwere drawn to this college. There is a kind of pioneer spirit here. They\nwere so enthusiastic to get it, it reminded me of why I got into art in\nthe \ufffdrst place\u2019\u2019 (Van der Werf, 1999, p. A42).\n\nLeepa implied little concern about he and his wife receiving an\nimmediate exchange for their support; rather, they were concerned\nabout rewarding and supporting the creative and innovative spirit\nthey admired in the college.\n\n48 M. R. Hall\n\n\n\nBUILDING COLLEGE\u2013 COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS\n\nFrom their beginnings, community colleges have nurtured links to\ntheir communities, and they have worked to create relationships\nbased on a fair exchange of fees and services. They also have estab-\nlished relationships based on the colleges\u2019 and their communities\u2019\neach working to assure the other thrives for the long term. Com-\nmunity colleges have existed as open systems, drawing resources\nfrom the environment, transforming those resources, and returning\nthem to the environment with value added so that the entire com-\nmunity is richer (Seymour, 1989). Community colleges have created\nan expanding resource pool that supports the community\u2019s well being\nand ultimately enables the community to provide more resources to\nthe colleges.\n\nCommunity colleges often have collaborated with companies in\ntheir regions to provide courses and training in areas of special in-\nterest and need to the companies. Such collaborations are important\nfor receiving corporate support, as Stendardi points out, because: \u2018\u2018The\nprimary characteristic of modern corporate philanthropy is that it is\nintended to produce a more speci\ufffdc, more measurable bene\ufffdt in a\nrelatively short time period\u2019\u2019 (1992, p. 24). Collaborations also help\nbuild relationships between college and company leaders and those\nrelationships are the key to mutually bene\ufffdcial agreements. As Peters\ntells us: \u2018\u2018Relationships really are all there is\u2019\u2019 (1992, p. 91). According\nto Wharton: \u2018\u2018Effective community colleges are those that satisfy,\npreferably delight, the key stakeholders they serve, which include\nstudents, faculty, staff, and the community\u2019\u2019 (1997, p. 15).\n\nTHE CONCEPTUAL LINK BETWEEN FUND RAISING\nAND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING\n\nSeasoned fundraising practitioners have passed their hard-learned\nlessons to professional newcomers through personal mentoring,\nworkshops and seminars, and many excellent books and articles\n(Broce, 1986; Buchanan, 2000; Hall, 1993; Howe, 1991; Rosso &amp; As-\nsociates, 1991; Seymour, 1966/1988; Worth, 1993). In her ground-\nbreaking book on fund raising, Kelly (1998) relates these practitioner\nlessons to theories from the \ufffdelds of organizational behavior, public\nrelations, and communications. Kelly describes four models of fund\nraising that she adapted from the scholarly work of Grunig (Grunig &amp;\nGrunig, 1992; Grunig &amp; Hunt, 1984). Each of Kelly\u2019s fundraising\nmodels is connected to a parallel one of Grunig\u2019s public relations\nmodels.\n\nRelationship-Based Fund Raising 49\n\n\n\nThe \ufffdrst model, a publicity model described by Grunig and his\ncolleagues (Grunig &amp; Grunig, 1992; Grunig &amp; Hunt, 1984), was\ndeveloped in the 19th century and was typi\ufffded by P. T. Barnum, \u2018\u2018who\nskillfully promoted his circus performers using the axiom \u2018There\nThe file is too long and its contents have been truncated.\n", "title": "Week 7_Building on Relationships.pdf", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "96d307a2-f11f-41a8-88aa-1cfcb1519af5", "request_id": "89369b69a8df83a6-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "96d307a2-f11f-41a8-88aa-1cfcb1519af5", "children": ["52dc622b-4e7e-4fb4-91d6-bcb097e08bdf"]}, "52dc622b-4e7e-4fb4-91d6-bcb097e08bdf": {"id": "52dc622b-4e7e-4fb4-91d6-bcb097e08bdf", "message": {"id": "52dc622b-4e7e-4fb4-91d6-bcb097e08bdf", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1718329194.004449, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\nPlease remember to search the user&#x27;s documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "9e82693f-2657-4113-ac22-f3c98f43de54", "request_id": "89369b69a8df83a6-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "9e82693f-2657-4113-ac22-f3c98f43de54", "children": ["b5cab79c-5afc-49d7-8758-be4ebdf08164"]}, "b5cab79c-5afc-49d7-8758-be4ebdf08164": {"id": "b5cab79c-5afc-49d7-8758-be4ebdf08164", "message": {"id": "b5cab79c-5afc-49d7-8758-be4ebdf08164", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1718329194.004487, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Here is a synthesis and summary of the main ideas and goals discussed in each of the references provided:\n\n1. **Gregg Lunceford (Forbes Article)**:\n   - **Main Ideas**: Lunceford discusses the importance of understanding one&#x27;s relationship with money.

What is the principal argument in this article?The central thesis of Porter and Kramer&#x27;s (1999) article &#x27;Philanthropy&#x27;s New Agenda: Creating Value\u2019 highlights the unique and transformative role that philanthropic organizations can play in advancing social progress through strategic giving. The authors argue that foundations with their distinct financial and operational independence are uniquely positioned to lead innovations in addressing social issues. They emphasize that foundations can maximize their impact not just by passively distributing funds but by actively selecting and managing their involvements to generate the highest social return on investment. This approach involves leveraging their resources to strengthen high-performing organizations stimulate innovation and drive systemic changes that tackle the root causes of societal problems.\nPart B: Describe the differences between development and fundraising and how they relate to one another. Then describe how you will enact development plans that will positively contribute to your fundraising.\nWhile the terms&#x27; development&#x27; and &#x27;fundraising&#x27; are often used interchangeably they have distinct roles within an organization. Fundraising primarily involves collecting monetary support usually focusing on immediate financial targets and often driven by specific events or campaigns. On the other hand development encompasses a broader scope. It includes fundraising but extends to nurturing long-term relationships with donors strategic resource planning and fostering a philanthropic culture within and around the organization (Frumpkin 2005).\nThe strategic nature of development plans is a crucial element in enhancing fundraising efforts. These plans are not solely focused on acquiring funds but on retaining and engaging donors over the long term. They involve understanding donors&#x27; motivations aligning these motivations with the organization&#x27;s goals and creating meaningful engagement opportunities. This approach not only secures immediate financial support but also establishes a base of loyal supporters who are committed to the organization&#x27;s mission in the long run (Frumkin 2005).\nAt the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation I would implement these concepts in a variety of impactful ways. First I would foster community engagement ensuring that development activities deeply resonate with community needs and values. Second I would prioritize transparency providing clear information on how funds are used to strengthen trust and deepen donor relationships. Lastly I would diversify funding sources by exploring revenue streams beyond traditional donations\u2014such as social enterprises or membership programs\u2014enhancing financial stability and ensuring alignment with the organization\u2019s mission. These strategies when implemented collectively would significantly boost fundraising efforts and align them with the broader goal of fostering a more equitable and joyful society.\n\nPart C: David Rubenstein discusses how anyone can be a philanthropist. He used his wealth to do \u201cpatriotic philanthropy\u201d to purchase rare documents for public consumption and fix historic buildings so Americans can learn more about their history. David reminds the listeners that although he has spent large sums of money on philanthropy you don\u2019t need to spend money to be a great philanthropist. Describe how you have been or will be a great philanthropist.\n\nAs the conceptual founder of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) I am deeply inspired by the idea that effective philanthropy does not require vast wealth. This is reflected in David Rubenstein&#x27;s (2015) notion of &quot;patriotic philanthropy&quot; where he uses his resources to enhance public knowledge and national pride by preserving historical documents and monuments. Though GHiF is currently just a vision it embodies my commitment to using available resources\u2014be it time expertise or networks\u2014to foster societal improvement. My vision for GHiF includes initiatives that go beyond financial aid aiming to address essential human needs such as healthcare mental wellness education and enriching travel experiences that broaden perspectives and promote understanding. Research indicates that corporate philanthropy can significantly impact societal causes even when it involves non-monetary contributions such as volunteer work and expertise (Van der Heyden &amp; Van der Rijt 2004).\nFrom my perspective philanthropy is about actively contributing to the betterment of society and creating opportunities that allow individuals to thrive. Studies have shown that corporate philanthropy can enhance both social and economic outcomes benefiting communities and improving corporate reputation and performance (Navickas &amp; Kontautien\u0117 2011).  I believe that true philanthropic wealth is measured not by personal gain but by the impact we have on the lives of others. As GHIF takes shape it will strive to turn these principles into action aiming to make a significant and positive difference in the world.\n\n\n\nDavid Rubenstein (Director). (2015 July 14).

Our mission is based on the belief that individual happiness is a societal asset fostering a healthier more resilient and interconnected world. GHIF focuses on healthcare access educational opportunities and wellness travel experiences. By partnering with local healthcare providers academic institutions and travel agencies GHIF aims to deliver services that address immediate and long-term needs.\nThe purpose of GHIF is to improve overall well-being and happiness globally. We aim to increase access to well-being services in the United States and Italy and establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international organizations. Our objectives include launching educational programs reaching over 5000 individuals securing healthcare partnerships with at least five major providers and developing a wellness travel model ready for implementation within 18 months.\nOur Theory of Change centers on the idea that enhanced access to healthcare education and cultural experiences leads to a healthier more connected society. By organizing mobile health clinics providing mental health counseling and conducting preventive health workshops we aim to improve health outcomes. Expanding educational opportunities through after-school programs scholarships and vocational training will improve psychological well-being. The wellness travel model will integrate health-promoting activities with cultural experiences to reduce stress and enhance mental health.\nEvaluation is crucial to our strategy. We use a mixed-methods approach combining formative and summative assessments to ensure continuous improvement and measure program effectiveness. Data collection tools include surveys interviews focus groups and program monitoring data. \nWe are requesting a grant of $3000000 which covers healthcare services educational programs wellness travel experiences administrative costs and evaluation. This budget ensures effective resource allocation for immediate and long-term impact. By leveraging donor support and strategic partnerships GHIF aims to make a significant and sustainable impact on global well-being. Our approach emphasis on collaboration and commitment to community engagement ensure that our initiatives are culturally relevant and meet local needs fostering a happier healthier and more interconnected world.\nIntroduction\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation&#x27;s mission vision and objectives are rooted in the idea that an individual&#x27;s happiness is not just a personal achievement but a societal asset. A content person is a beacon of positivity capable of enriching their community. When we collectively strive for happiness we also invest in our well-being and foster a society free from the shackles of discontent. \nAs the renowned author John Donne (2010) famously proclaimed \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d This sentiment holds true in our pursuit of societal greatness. Achieving this requires unity and collaboration. However when an individual is grappling with internal conflicts such as mental health struggles physical ailments and a general decline in well-being overcoming these challenges alone becomes an insurmountable task. Wellness is not just a personal concern but a societal issue that impacts us all.\nIn addition to discussing wellness it is necessary also to address the role of education. If wellness is the foundation education is the next step where individuals acquire the skills needed to lead purposeful dignified and joyful lives. Nobody is inherently equipped with the knowledge to improve their surroundings; it must be learned. Therefore education holds equal significance in the pursuit of wellness. As one begins to grasp the world&#x27;s order concepts like the principles of space and time the philosophies of Aristotle the mathematics of our universe and the evocative poetry of Yates one starts to perceive the world in a new nuanced way. Therefore to truly understand oneself it is sometimes necessary to first understand one&#x27;s environment. Thus in parallel with well-being education holds great importance.\nAs individuals gain knowledge about the world around them they instinctively desire to explore it further engaging with it through the senses of touch taste and sight. Rather than solely studying Mozart and reading musical notations experiencing the music in person is essential. Therefore travel is an invaluable gateway to becoming a well-rounded individual capable of positively contributing to society.\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to creating a better world. By leveraging the support of donor investors the foundation aims to empower individuals to pursue their own happiness by providing necessary tools. Our efforts involve establishing partnerships with local government bodies and healthcare providers to ensure easy access to government services and healthcare and make travel accessible to all who desire it. These initiatives will lay the foundation for our long-term vision of a globally interconnected and joyful society.\nPurpose\nThe primary purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally through increased access to essential life-enhancing services. The Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to providing the necessary tools for individuals to pursue their happiness. Our starting point is ensuring access to healthcare and mental health services as a fundamental human right and a crucial component in our efforts to build a better world. We also aim to utilize well-being travel cultural immersion and education resources to empower individuals to gain self-awareness understand others and collectively achieve holistic happiness.\nGoals\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is committed to enhancing the global quality of life through two strategic goals.\nLong-term Goal: Increase Access to Key Well-being Services\nOur long-term goal is to significantly increase access to well-being services globally with our efforts first being localized in the United States and Italy. By doing so we strive to improve the quality of life and foster sustained happiness in diverse communities. This goal will benefit the communities we serve and provide donor-investors with the satisfaction of knowing that their support is making a tangible difference in people&#x27;s lives. The impact of these programs will be measured by tracking the number of individuals accessing these services the improvement in health and education outcomes and overall satisfaction rates among participants reflecting the direct benefits of our initiatives.\nShort-term Goal: Establish and Strengthen Partnerships\nPartnerships are at the heart of our strategy. Our short-term goal is to establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international public and private organizations. These partnerships are beneficial and crucial for enhancing our capability to deliver critical services effectively and efficiently. By collaborating with organizations with established infrastructures and expertise in our target regions we can leverage their strengths to better serve the communities&#x27; needs. Formalizing at least five significant partnerships within the first six months will be vital to achieving this goal.\nBoth goals complement existing efforts in the target communities rather than duplicate them ensuring that our interventions add value and create a measurable impact. Through these focused efforts the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation seeks to build a foundation for long-term social change that contributes to the well-being of individuals worldwide.\nObjectives\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) has set ambitious yet achievable objectives to ensure a broad and lasting impact on global well-being.\nEducational Expansion\nOur first objective focuses on education expansion. Within the first year GHIF plans to launch educational programs in at least two countries aiming to reach over 5000 individuals. These programs will be developed to address local educational gaps better equip youths with functional skills and promote holistic learning experiences. Evidence shows that educational programs can significantly enhance psychological well-being by increasing self-efficacy social support and overall life satisfaction (Ross &amp; Van Willigen 1997). Moreover education has been linked to improved health outcomes and better mental health with increased years of education correlating with lower rates of depression and anxiety (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder 2022). The success of these programs will be measured by the number of programs successfully launched the total number of participants enrolled and participant feedback on program effectiveness.\nHealthcare Partnerships\nSimultaneously GHIF aims to establish healthcare partnerships to enhance access to medical and mental health services. We plan to secure partnerships with at least five major healthcare providers by the end of the first six months. These collaborations focus on providing comprehensive health services emphasizing preventive care and mental health vital to improving individual well-being. Studies have shown that partnerships between educational institutions and healthcare providers can significantly improve health outcomes particularly in preventive care and mental health services (Ross &amp; Wu 1995). The effectiveness of these partnerships will be assessed through the number of agreements signed the range of services provided and feedback from service users regarding the accessibility and quality of care.\nWellness Travel Model\nLastly our third objective is to develop a wellness travel model which will be designed developed and ready for implementation within the first eighteen months. This model will provide frameworks for wellness-oriented travel experiences promoting mental and physical health benefits through carefully crafted travel packages. Wellness programs embedded in educational and travel contexts have positively impacted well-being reducing stress and improving mental health (Young et al. 2020). The model\u2019s success will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction measured through surveys and the repeat engagement rate indicating the model&#x27;s appeal and effectiveness in enhancing participants&#x27; well-being.\nOrganizational Capacity\nFoundation Structure and Management Capability\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is designed to be a robust organization capable of managing large-scale projects and substantial grants. At its inception GHIF will establish a governance structure with a board of directors comprising education healthcare mental health and non-profit management experts. This board will provide strategic oversight and ensure all activities align with our mission and objectives.\nFounding Team Expertise\nThe founding team of GHIF includes highly qualified professionals selected for their extensive experience in project management international development healthcare and educational programming. Our recruitment strategy focuses on identifying individuals with a proven track record such as a Project Director with significant experience in managing and scaling community health programs an Education Specialist renowned for developing effective curricula in diverse cultural settings and a Mental Health Advocate with a strong background in leading global mental wellness initiatives. This planned assembly of expertise ensures a comprehensive and skilled approach to achieving the foundation\u2019s objectives.\nProject Management Systems\nGHIF will implement rigorous project management methodologies to oversee all foundation activities. We will utilize established frameworks such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) guidelines to plan execute monitor and close projects. Additionally GHIF will adopt modern project management tools for real-time tracking and reporting facilitating transparent and efficient management of the grant funds.\nPreparatory Actions for Grant Management\nPrior to receiving the grant GHIF will:\nFormulate detailed project plans including timelines budgets and resource allocation.\nEstablish financial management policies tailored to ensure accountability and prudent use of funds.\nInitiate discussions with potential partners and stakeholders to build a support network for immediate project launch upon funding.\nDemonstrating Capacity through Strategic Intentions\nWhile GHIF is a nascent organization our strategic planning reflects a clear and actionable roadmap for immediate impact upon funding. The foundation\u2019s goals are backed by a commitment to leverage the diverse skills of its team and the strategic insights of its board to establish a high-performing organization. GHIF&#x27;s initial actions and detailed project preparations demonstrate our readiness and capability to effectively manage and utilize the grant to achieve significant social impact.\nCross-Sector Collaboration \nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to developing localized high-impact programs that serve as models for global implementation. To achieve this GHIF emphasizes cross-sector collaboration mainly focusing on strategic partnerships in Italy and the United States. These collaborations are designed to leverage regional strengths and address specific local needs ensuring the adaptability and effectiveness of our well-being services.\nLocalized Educational Partnerships\nGHIF will collaborate with leading educational institutions in Italy and the United States to integrate well-being practices into educational curricula. This initiative will focus on regions with significant disparities in educational outcomes providing targeted interventions that are culturally and contextually relevant. Research indicates collaborative learning environments and educational partnerships can significantly enhance student outcomes and well-being (Kilgo et al. 2015). Success in these partnerships will be evaluated based on academic improvements student well-being metrics and the scalability of the programs to other regions.\nHealthcare Alliances\nGHIF plans to partner with healthcare organizations in Italy and the United States to increase access to quality health services. These partnerships will focus on integrating mental health services with primary care a critical need in both countries as local health reports indicate. Indeed studies have shown that cross-sector healthcare collaborations can improve health outcomes particularly when mental health services are integrated with primary care (Randall et al. 2023). By working with local health providers and community organizations these initiatives aim to create sustainable health improvement models suitable for global replication.\nPublic-Private Partnerships\nGHIF will seek partnerships with local government bodies and private sectors in Italy and the United States to support infrastructure development vital to program delivery. These partnerships will help facilitate the creation of community wellness centers which will serve as hubs for education healthcare and community activities. Effective public-private partnerships have been shown to enhance community health and well-being significantly (Ovseiko et al. 2014). The effectiveness of these centers will be measured through community engagement rates and the overall improvement in community health and educational outcomes.\nCommunity Engagement\nIntegral to our strategy is the direct involvement of local communities in Italy and the United States in the planning and implementation phases. GHIF believes that community input is essential to tailoring programs that genuinely reflect and meet local needs. Feedback mechanisms and community advisory boards will be established to monitor the programs\u2019 impacts and guide iterative improvements as evidence proves that community involvement is crucial for the success and sustainability of public health programs (Mattessich &amp; Rausch 2014).\nProgram Plan\nIntroduction to Program Strategy\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is committed to addressing critical needs in communities across the United States and Italy. We implement multifaceted strategies that enhance individual well-being and community health specifically designed to complement rather than duplicate existing services. Our comprehensive approach leverages local strengths and targets specific challenges through innovative and sustainable solutions.\n\nIntegration with Government and Healthcare Services\nOur initiative targets significant gaps in access to healthcare and government support services. These gaps have been identified through extensive community outreach and stakeholder engagement underscoring a pressing need for improved service accessibility and quality. To address these challenges GHIF plans to forge strategic alliances with local health departments and social service agencies creating a referral network that facilitates individuals&#x27; access to the services they need. This network aims to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of health and social care systems.\nPartnership development is crucial for the success of our healthcare integration strategy. By collaborating with local health authorities and service providers we aim to establish robust partnerships that facilitate streamlined access to healthcare and support services. These partnerships will be foundational in building a comprehensive referral system that enhances service delivery and meets the specific needs of the communities we serve.\nIn addition to building partnerships GHIF will engage in advocacy and policy work to enhance healthcare delivery. We will work closely with policymakers to advocate for regulations and policies prioritizing the health and well-being of underrepresented communities. Our focus on advocacy aims to influence policy changes that improve healthcare accessibility and address systemic barriers in service delivery.\nTraining community health workers is another critical component of our strategy. GHIF will implement comprehensive training programs designed to enhance the capabilities of health workers in assisting individuals effectively. These programs will focus on developing empathy technical skills and a deep understanding of the healthcare system. This will ensure that community health workers are well-equipped to support individuals in navigating health and social services.\nWellness Travel Model\nGHIF recognizes the therapeutic potential of travel in promoting mental and physical well-being. To harness this potential we are developing a Wellness Travel Model that integrates health benefits with cultural and educational experiences. This innovative approach to wellness extends beyond traditional health settings and includes travel packages that feature guided meditations wellness workshops and cultural tours. Each package is designed in collaboration with travel experts and cultural institutions to ensure that it offers genuine health benefits and facilitates cultural appreciation.\nCommunity-based involvement is integral to the design and execution of our Wellness Travel Model. We engage local communities in developing travel experiences to ensure they are culturally respectful and enriching for visitors and hosts. This engagement helps create authentic travel experiences sensitive to the host communities&#x27; cultural dynamics and provides meaningful interactions that benefit all participants.\nHolistic Educational Access\nGHIF is also dedicated to transforming educational access by integrating a curriculum that includes advanced technology training and comprehensive arts education. This holistic approach aims to bridge the gap in technological and creative skills preparing individuals for the demands of the modern workforce and personal development. Our curriculum includes coding robotics visual arts and music training and is designed to be integrated into school systems and community learning centers.\nGHIF will establish ongoing learning opportunities through workshops and seminars open to all age groups to complement our formal education initiatives. These initiatives focus on continuous skill development and personal growth promoting lifelong learning and adaptability. By offering workshops and seminars that cover a range of skills and artistic disciplines we aim to foster an environment of continuous learning and creative exploration.\nTimeline and Evaluation\nThe timeline for these initiatives is strategically set to ensure a phased implementation. By the end of the second quarter of 2025 GHIF will establish the initial partnerships necessary for the referral systems and develop training programs for community health workers. Following the establishment of partnerships early in the same year the Wellness Travel Packages are expected to be launched by the third quarter of 2025. Educational program rollouts will begin in the fourth quarter of 2024 and be fully implemented across targeted regions by the second quarter of 2025.\nEach element of the program plan is designed to measure specific outcomes related to access satisfaction and educational attainment ensuring that GHIF&#x27;s interventions create measurable and sustainable impacts in the communities served. This strategic planning demonstrates GHIF&#x27;s capability to manage a large grant effectively and fulfill its mission of building a foundation for long-term social change that contributes significantly to global well-being.\n\nGHIF Project Timeline and Deliverables\n\t\nDeliverables\t\nActivities\t\nDue Date\t\nExpected Challenges\n\t\nSet up Referral Systems\t\nEstablish partnerships develop training for staff\t\nQ2 2025\t\nRegulatory hurdles securing partner cooperation\n\t\nLaunch Wellness Travel Packages\t\nDesign packages negotiate with travel agencies\t\nQ3 2025\t\nLogistics coordination ensuring accessibility and inclusion\n\t\nRollout Educational Programs\t\nDevelop curricula and integrate into schools\t\nQ4 2025\t\nAdaptation to local educational standards funding\n\t\nPublic Workshops and Seminars\t\nPlan and implement workshops and lifelong learning seminars\t\nQ1 2026\t\nCommunity engagement sustaining interest over time\n\n\nEvaluation Capacity for the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF)\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is dedicated to improving individual well-being and societal happiness through strategic and well-defined programs. Evaluating these initiatives is critical to understanding their impact and continuously refining their effectiveness. GHIF\u2019s evaluation approach incorporates formative and summative assessments to ensure comprehensive feedback and learning throughout the project lifecycle (Serrat 2017).\nFormative and Summative Evaluation: Rationale\nGHIF employs a mixed-methods evaluation strategy combining both formative and summative evaluations. Formative evaluation is ongoing and focuses on process evaluation intended to improve program implementation in real-time by identifying and addressing operational issues as they arise. This approach is aligned with the foundation&#x27;s adaptive management strategy allowing for continuous improvements based on systematic data collection and analysis (Hayes et al. 2011). Summative evaluation occurs at the end of the project cycle aiming to assess the outcomes and impact of the interventions. This will provide GHIF and its stakeholders with evidence of the program\u2019s effectiveness and insights into how the initiatives have contributed to the long-term goal of increased well-being and happiness. The rationale behind this dual approach is to ensure that while the program\u2019s processes are optimized for success their ultimate effectiveness in achieving the desired outcomes is also rigorously assessed (SoPact 2020).\nGuiding Evaluation Questions\nThe effectiveness of GHIF programs in increasing access to critical well-being services in targeted communities is critical to the foundation&#x27;s mission. One of the guiding evaluation questions asks &quot;How effectively do the GHIF programs increase access to key well-being services in targeted communities?&quot; Measuring how effectively these programs enhance access involves assessing improvements in health outcomes increased usage of services and participant satisfaction. For example providing mental health services and preventive care through local partnerships can significantly reduce barriers to accessing these services thereby enhancing overall community well-being (Ross &amp; Wu 1995). Successful implementation of these programs leads to a healthier population directly contributing to GHIF\u2019s overarching goal of fostering societal harmony and happiness. This focus on accessibility is essential as it ensures that the benefits of GHIF\u2019s initiatives reach the most vulnerable populations ultimately promoting equity and inclusivity in health and well-being.\nUnderstanding the measurable impacts of the educational programs on participants&#x27; psychological well-being and social support systems is another crucial aspect of the evaluation. The question &quot;What are the measurable impacts of the educational programs on participants&#x27; psychological well-being and social support systems?&quot; guides this analysis. Educational programs profoundly impact participants by improving self-efficacy and fostering a sense of community which can alleviate feelings of isolation and anxiety (Ross &amp; Van Willigen 1997). The GHIF\u2019s educational initiatives aim to equip individuals with functional skills and holistic learning experiences thereby improving mental health outcomes and strengthening social support networks (Kondirolli &amp; Sunder 2022). This enhanced psychological well-being supports the foundation&#x27;s broader objective of achieving holistic happiness through education. It creates a ripple effect where educated individuals can contribute positively to their communities furthering societal well-being.\nAnother key evaluation question is evaluating the extent to which healthcare partnerships have enhanced access to medical and mental health services. Examining &quot;To what extent have healthcare partnerships improved access to medical and mental health services?&quot; is essential for understanding the impact of collaborative health efforts. Healthcare partnerships are crucial for improving access to these services by integrating mental health services with primary care and ensuring comprehensive healthcare delivery especially in underserved areas (Randall et al. 2023). The effectiveness of these partnerships in the GHIF\u2019s model can be measured by the range and quality of services provided and the level of accessibility experienced by community members. Successful healthcare partnerships support the foundation&#x27;s goal of enhancing global quality of life through improved health outcomes and demonstrate the importance of collaborative approaches in addressing complex health issues. These partnerships ensure services are delivered efficiently and sustainably maximizing their impact on community health.\nEvaluating how participants perceive the quality and benefits of the wellness travel model is crucial in determining its success and potential for broader application. The guiding question &quot;How do participants perceive the quality and benefits of the wellness travel model?&quot; addresses this aspect. Positive feedback and high satisfaction levels can indicate these travel experiences&#x27; effectiveness in promoting mental and physical health (Young et al. 2020). GHIF\u2019s wellness travel initiatives are designed to provide therapeutic benefits and cultural enrichment fostering a profound sense of well-being and personal growth. This innovative approach aligns with GHIF\u2019s commitment to creating well-rounded individuals who can contribute positively to society. By incorporating participant feedback into the evaluation process GHIF ensures that its wellness travel programs remain relevant and responsive to the needs of its participants thereby enhancing their overall effectiveness.\nThese guiding evaluation questions inform GHIF\u2019s activities by emphasizing the importance of accessibility psychological well-being healthcare partnerships and participant feedback. Addressing these areas allows GHIF to refine its strategies enhance the effectiveness of its programs and better communicate its impact to stakeholders. This comprehensive evaluation approach ensures that GHIF\u2019s initiatives are effective in achieving their intended outcomes and continuously improved to meet the evolving needs of the communities they serve.\nData Collection Tools\nTo effectively gather data for formative and summative evaluations the Global Health Improvement Foundation (GHIF) will employ a comprehensive suite of data collection tools designed to capture quantitative and qualitative data providing a holistic view of program performance and impact. Surveys and questionnaires will be essential for collecting quantitative data on participant satisfaction outcome achievement and the overall impact of services provided. These instruments will be administered in paper-based and electronic formats utilizing platforms such as SurveyMonkey Google Forms and Qualtrics. These tools offer robust analytics features enabling real-time data visualization and reporting crucial for timely and informed decision-making (Dillman et al. 2014).\nIn addition to surveys interviews and focus groups will be conducted to gather qualitative data through structured interactions with participants stakeholders and program staff. These methods provide deeper insights into the experiences and effects of program activities. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be facilitated in person over the phone or via video conferencing platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams allowing for flexibility and broader participation. Trained interviewers will use standardized guides to ensure consistency while enabling in-depth exploration of specific topics. The qualitative data collected will be analyzed using software such as NVivo and ATLAS.ti which support the coding and thematic analysis of interview transcripts and focus group discussions thereby identifying patterns and trends within the qualitative data (Creswell &amp; Poth 2018).\nRegular collection of program monitoring data will also play an integral role in informing both formative and summative evaluations. This data will be captured through attendance sheets registration logs and digital tracking systems and include the number of workshops held healthcare screenings conducted and participation rates in educational programs. GHIF will implement management information systems (MIS) such as Salesforce and DHIS2 to record and manage this data. These systems offer features like automated data entry and real-time updates enhancing data accuracy and accessibility. Integrating such technology ensures a seamless flow of information and supports comprehensive program monitoring (Wang &amp; Strong 1996).\nGHIF will leverage cloud-based platforms and mobile applications that enable remote data entry and real-time synchronization to ensure seamless integration of various data collection tools. These technologies will allow field staff to enter data directly into the system using tablets or smartphones reducing the risk of data loss and errors associated with manual data entry. Moreover GHIF is committed to maintaining the highest data security and privacy standards. All data collection tools and systems will comply with relevant data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Measures will include encryption secure data storage and restricted access to sensitive information with regular audits and staff training ensuring ongoing compliance and the safeguarding of participant data (McCallister et al. 2010).\nBy employing diverse data collection tools and integrating advanced technology and software GHIF will gather comprehensive data to inform both formative and summative evaluations. This approach enables the foundation to assess and enhance its programs&#x27; effectiveness continually ultimately driving improved health outcomes and service delivery. The integration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies supported by state-of-the-art software ensures that GHIF&#x27;s evaluation processes are both thorough and precise reflecting a commitment to excellence in program evaluation and improvement (Creswell &amp; Creswell 2018).\nTheory of Change\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) is driven by a vision where individual happiness is the cornerstone of societal harmony. This vision recognizes that personal well-being is not merely an individual concern but a critical societal asset. Our Theory of Change articulates a systematic pathway to achieve this vision by enhancing access to healthcare education and cultural experiences. This comprehensive approach ensures that our initiatives contribute meaningfully to long-term societal well-being.\nThe foundation of GHIF&#x27;s Theory of Change begins with identifying the desired long-term impact: a healthier more resilient and interconnected global society. To achieve this our model delineates a series of early and intermediate outcomes that are essential for realizing the ultimate goal. These outcomes include improved access to healthcare services increased educational attainment and enhanced cultural understanding through travel. Each of these outcomes is interconnected forming a pathway that underscores the holistic nature of our approach.\nHealthcare access is paramount to our strategy. By partnering with local healthcare providers and governments GHIF ensures that essential medical and mental health services are available to underserved communities. Specific activities include organizing mobile health clinics providing mental health counseling and conducting preventive health workshops. Studies have demonstrated that improved access to healthcare services leads to better health outcomes and increased longevity (Gu et al. 2009). Our initiatives therefore focus on preventive care and mental health services which are critical for building a healthy society. This strategic focus addresses immediate health needs and contributes to long-term societal well-being by reducing healthcare disparities. Measurement indicators include the number of individuals served health outcomes such as reduced incidence of chronic diseases and patient satisfaction levels.\nEducation is the second pillar of our Theory of Change. GHIF aims to expand educational opportunities by implementing programs that address local educational gaps and promote holistic learning experiences. Activities include setting up after-school programs providing scholarships for higher education and offering vocational training. Educational attainment has been shown to improve psychological well-being and enhance social support networks (Ross &amp; Van Willigen 1997). Our educational programs are designed to equip individuals with the skills necessary for personal development and societal contribution. By fostering a culture of continuous learning GHIF ensures that individuals are prepared to navigate and contribute to a rapidly changing world. Progress will be measured by the number of students enrolled graduation rates and improvements in literacy and employment rates.\nThe third pillar of our Theory of Change is cultural immersion through travel. GHIF&#x27;s wellness travel model integrates health-promoting activities with cultural experiences allowing participants to gain new perspectives and improve their mental and physical well-being. Specific initiatives include guided meditation retreats wellness workshops and cultural exchange programs. Research indicates that wellness programs embedded in travel experiences can significantly reduce stress and enhance mental health (Young et al. 2020). By facilitating these enriching experiences GHIF promotes a more connected and empathetic global community essential for fostering societal harmony. Success indicators include participant feedback on their mental well-being the number of travel experiences conducted and repeat engagement rates.\nGHIF&#x27;s Theory of Change is a comprehensive framework integrating healthcare education and cultural experiences to enhance individual and societal well-being. GHIF sets the stage for long-term societal transformation by systematically addressing these areas. Our theory of change outlines the steps necessary to achieve our goals and provides a clear roadmap for measuring progress and making necessary adjustments. As such GHIF remains committed to creating a happier healthier and more interconnected world.\nLogic Model for GHIF Programs\nThe Global Health Improvement Foundation (GHIF) programs are underpinned by a detailed logic model encompassing several essential inputs and resources. Central to these inputs is the securement of funding through various channels including grants donations and in-kind support from corporate sponsors and individual donors. Such funding is crucial for covering operational costs program development and service delivery. Adequate funding ensures that resources are appropriately allocated to meet the needs of the target population as emphasized by Serrat (2017) who notes that sustained financial support is vital for the continuity and effectiveness of program activities.\nEqually important are the human resources that drive GHIF&#x27;s programs. This team of trained professionals including program managers health professionals educators and support staff brings a wealth of expertise and commitment vital to successful program implementation and management. The quality and capability of these human resources directly influence the effectiveness of program activities. Frumkin (2005) underscores the critical role of skilled and dedicated personnel in achieving program goals and delivering high-quality services.\nFurthermore GHIF leverages strategic partnerships to enhance its capacity to deliver comprehensive services. Collaborations with healthcare providers educational institutions governmental agencies and community organizations are integral to the foundation&#x27;s strategy. These partnerships enable GHIF to expand its reach and impact by leveraging external expertise and resources. Kilgo et al. (2015) highlight the importance of such strategic alliances in broadening the scope and effectiveness of educational and health programs.\nGHIF&#x27;s detailed logic model integrates funding human resources and strategic partnerships to create a robust framework for program delivery. These components work synergistically to ensure that GHIF can effectively meet its objectives and make a significant impact on the health and well-being of the communities it serves. By securing adequate funding harnessing the expertise of dedicated professionals and forming strategic partnerships GHIF is well-positioned to deliver on its mission and drive meaningful change.\nThe activities undertaken by GHIF to achieve its goals are diverse and targeted. Health workshops focus on mental health preventative care and healthy lifestyles in various communities aiming to educate participants on essential health topics and promote behaviors that enhance well-being. According to Young et al. (2022) educational workshops can significantly improve mental health and overall quality of life. Educational programs emphasize personal development professional skills and wellness practices empowering individuals to improve their life circumstances and contribute positively to their communities (Ross &amp; Van Willigen 1997). Organized wellness travel experiences integrate health-promoting activities with cultural immersion providing participants with opportunities to relax rejuvenate and gain new perspectives thereby enhancing their mental and physical well-being (Hayes et al. 2011). Community engagement initiatives involve events and forums that encourage feedback and active participation in program services which is crucial for tailoring services to local needs and ensuring sustainable impact (Mattessich &amp; Rausch 2014).\nThe outputs of GHIF\u2019s programs are the immediate tangible results of its activities. The number of workshops held is a quantitative measure of GHIF&#x27;s outreach efforts tracking the total sessions conducted in health education and wellness (Hayes et al. 2011). The number of participants served reflects the program&#x27;s reach and engagement with the target population (Young et al. 2022). The quantity of educational materials distributed indicates the program\u2019s efforts to disseminate knowledge and resources (Ross &amp; Van Willigen 1997). The number of health assessments performed measures the direct health services delivered to participants (Cunningham et al. 1998). The number of collaborative initiatives with other organizations and stakeholders highlights GHIF&#x27;s efforts to build and maintain strategic partnerships (Kilgo et al. 2015).\nThe outcomes represent the changes or benefits resulting from the program activities. Improved health metrics are evidenced by reduced health issues and overall wellness among participants as measured by pre- and post-assessment data. Improved health metrics indicate the effectiveness of health workshops and services provided by GHIF (Gu et al. 2009). Increased knowledge tracked through surveys and tests enhances participants&#x27; understanding of health and wellness topics empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their well-being (Ross &amp; Wu 1995). Enhanced community well-being measured by community surveys assessing changes in local health and educational outcomes indicates the broader impact of GHIF&#x27;s programs (Randall et al. 2023). Strengthened partnerships evaluated through regular reviews and stakeholder feedback are essential for sustaining program activities and expanding their reach (Ovseiko et al. 2014).\nThe long-term impacts of GHIF\u2019s programs reflect the foundation&#x27;s overarching mission. Societal happiness influenced by improved individual health and community engagement is the ultimate goal reflecting the cumulative effects of the foundation&#x27;s initiatives (Serrat 2017). Cultural integration resulting from increased appreciation and understanding of different cultures through educational and travel experiences contributes to social cohesion and mutual respect enhancing the quality of life and promoting global understanding (Young et al. 2022). Sustainable health practices marked by the long-term adoption of healthy behaviors within communities lead to decreased healthcare costs and improved quality of life. Sustainable health practices are a critical impact of GHIF&#x27;s health programs ensuring lasting benefits for participants (Cunningham et al. 1998).\nBudget\nThe Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) requires a comprehensive budget and budget justification to effectively implement its programs to enhance healthcare access educational opportunities and cultural immersion. The budget must align with the organization&#x27;s vision and strategic goals ensuring transparency and efficient use of funds.\nThe proposed budget for GHIF encompasses key areas essential for achieving our mission: healthcare services educational programs wellness travel experiences administrative costs and evaluation.

Berlin underscores the importance of understanding personal attitudes towards wealth and money, emphasizing that such awareness is crucial for effective fundraising and, by extension, for leveraging financial resources towards meaningful social change (Berlin, 2019). In your perspective, while money represents a type of freedom, it also embodies the constraints and flaws of a capitalist system that prioritizes profit over people. Your relationship with money, therefore, is dual: you recognize its utility in empowering and supporting human rights causes yet remain critical of the broader economic systems that prioritize capital accumulation at the expense of communal and ethical well-being.\n\n### Part B: Building Relationships in Strategic Fundraising\n\nYour approach to relationship-building, particularly in the context of strategic fundraising, aligns with the principles discussed by Hall (2002) and Najev \u010ca\u010dija (2013). Hall emphasizes the importance of developing relationships based on trust, commitment, and mutual satisfaction, which are essential for successful fundraising efforts in community colleges (Hall, 2002). Similarly, \u010ca\u010dija discusses the integration of marketing strategies into fundraising, highlighting the need for a strategic approach in engaging potential donors (Najev \u010ca\u010dija, 2013). In practice, you focus on understanding and aligning with the motivations of donors, creating meaningful engagement opportunities that resonate with their values and your organizational goals. This method not only ensures sustained support but also builds a network of committed individuals who are invested in the cause, thereby fostering a sense of community and shared purpose that transcends financial transactions.\n\n### Part C: Strategic Elements of Fund with an Aim of Building Relations\n\nIn the landscape of fundraising, several elements require meticulous strategic planning. These include donor identification and segmentation, relationship management, communication strategies, event planning, and performance measurement. To plan effectively for these elements:\n\n1. **Donor Identification and Segmentation**: Start by analyzing your potential donor base to understand their interests, giving capacities, and motivations. This involves collecting data through surveys, interviews, and research, which can then be used to segment donors into groups for targeted strategies.\n\n2. **Relationship Management**: Develop a system to manage relationships with each donor segment effectively. This includes regular updates, personalized communications, and opportunities for donors to engage with the cause they are supporting. Implementing a donor management system or CRM software can help track interactions, preferences, and donations to maintain and deepen relationships over time.\n\n3. **Communication Strategies**: Craft communication plans that resonate with different donor segments. This might involve varied messaging that appeals to the specific values and interests of each group, ensuring that communications are both informative and emotive.\n\n4. **Event Planning**: Organize fundraising events that align with the interests of your target donor groups and provide real value to participants. Planning should start well in advance and include considerations for venue, logistics, programming, and how the event will provide an engaging donor experience.\n\n5. **Performance Measurement**: Set clear metrics for fundraising activities to evaluate their effectiveness.

What is the principal argument in this article?The central thesis of Porter and Kramer&#x27;s (1999) article &#x27;Philanthropy&#x27;s New Agenda: Creating Value\u2019 highlights the unique and transformative role that philanthropic organizations can play in advancing social progress through strategic giving. The authors argue that foundations with their distinct financial and operational independence are uniquely positioned to lead innovations in addressing social issues. They emphasize that foundations can maximize their impact not just by passively distributing funds but by actively selecting and managing their involvements to generate the highest social return on investment. This approach involves leveraging their resources to strengthen high-performing organizations stimulate innovation and drive systemic changes that tackle the root causes of societal problems.\nPart B: Describe the differences between development and fundraising and how they relate to one another. Then describe how you will enact development plans that will positively contribute to your fundraising.\nWhile the terms&#x27; development&#x27; and &#x27;fundraising&#x27; are often used interchangeably they have distinct roles within an organization. Fundraising primarily involves collecting monetary support usually focusing on immediate financial targets and often driven by specific events or campaigns. On the other hand development encompasses a broader scope. It includes fundraising but extends to nurturing long-term relationships with donors strategic resource planning and fostering a philanthropic culture within and around the organization (Frumpkin 2005).\nThe strategic nature of development plans is a crucial element in enhancing fundraising efforts. These plans are not solely focused on acquiring funds but on retaining and engaging donors over the long term. They involve understanding donors&#x27; motivations aligning these motivations with the organization&#x27;s goals and creating meaningful engagement opportunities. This approach not only secures immediate financial support but also establishes a base of loyal supporters who are committed to the organization&#x27;s mission in the long run (Frumkin 2005).\nAt the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation I would implement these concepts in a variety of impactful ways. First I would foster community engagement ensuring that development activities deeply resonate with community needs and values. Second I would prioritize transparency providing clear information on how funds are used to strengthen trust and deepen donor relationships. Lastly I would diversify funding sources by exploring revenue streams beyond traditional donations\u2014such as social enterprises or membership programs\u2014enhancing financial stability and ensuring alignment with the organization\u2019s mission. These strategies when implemented collectively would significantly boost fundraising efforts and align them with the broader goal of fostering a more equitable and joyful society.\n\nPart C: David Rubenstein discusses how anyone can be a philanthropist. He used his wealth to do \u201cpatriotic philanthropy\u201d to purchase rare documents for public consumption and fix historic buildings so Americans can learn more about their history. David reminds the listeners that although he has spent large sums of money on philanthropy you don\u2019t need to spend money to be a great philanthropist. Describe how you have been or will be a great philanthropist.\n\nAs the conceptual founder of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF) I am deeply inspired by the idea that effective philanthropy does not require vast wealth. This is reflected in David Rubenstein&#x27;s (2015) notion of &quot;patriotic philanthropy&quot; where he uses his resources to enhance public knowledge and national pride by preserving historical documents and monuments. Though GHiF is currently just a vision it embodies my commitment to using available resources\u2014be it time expertise or networks\u2014to foster societal improvement. My vision for GHiF includes initiatives that go beyond financial aid aiming to address essential human needs such as healthcare mental wellness education and enriching travel experiences that broaden perspectives and promote understanding. Research indicates that corporate philanthropy can significantly impact societal causes even when it involves non-monetary contributions such as volunteer work and expertise (Van der Heyden &amp; Van der Rijt 2004).\nFrom my perspective philanthropy is about actively contributing to the betterment of society and creating opportunities that allow individuals to thrive. Studies have shown that corporate philanthropy can enhance both social and economic outcomes benefiting communities and improving corporate reputation and performance (Navickas &amp; Kontautien\u0117 2011).  I believe that true philanthropic wealth is measured not by personal gain but by the impact we have on the lives of others. As GHIF takes shape it will strive to turn these principles into action aiming to make a significant and positive difference in the world.\n\n\n\nDavid Rubenstein (Director). (2015 July 14).

Our life experiences teach us that relationships\n\nwith people can be healthy or toxic based on a number of factors.\n\nHowever, how many of us consider whether our relationship with\n\nmoney can be the same?\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/money\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/people/gregglunceford/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/\n\n\nIn a 2018 survey, a little over half of respondents said they strongly\n\nbelieved their spouse or partner was honest with them about\n\nmoney. Arguing about money early in a relationship has been found\n\nto be the No. 1 predictor of whether a couple gets divorced.\n\nSo why is having a good relationship with money important?\n\nFinancial wellness is an important part of our overall well-being.\n\nFinancial wellness includes having a healthy relationship with\n\nmoney that makes us feel satisfied and not overly stressed out. A\n\n2015 report showed that money is the leading cause of stress for\n\nadults.\n\nSo how is our relationship with money formed? It\u2019s formed by our\n\nobservations and the messaging we see and hear related to money.\n\nAccording to a PBS report, children can understand basic concepts\n\nabout money as early as age 3, and by 7, their values around money\n\nare already set. Our early experiences with money, such as\n\nwitnessing arguments about it or being defined by it, can trigger a\n\nrange of emotions such as anxiety, resentment or feelings of elitism\n\nthat we carry through life. Those experiences and emotions shape\n\nour values and relationship with money.\n\nBased on our values, money can make us feel secure as we provide\n\nfor ourselves and others we care for. Our joy may come from the\n\nsacrifices we make with money. Money can also make us feel\n\ninsecure if we do not have the things we want. We can view it\n\nnegatively, as it may encourage envy and corruption. It can also\n\nposition us to be overly socially competitive by attempting to \u201cKeep\n\nup with the Joneses.\u201d\n\nWe can be led to believe money is the source of increased\n\nhappiness. However, a 2018 study by researchers at Purdue\n\nUniversity showed that individuals with an annual income of\n\n$95,000 reported the greatest level of overall life satisfaction. The\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/story/14475875/1/is-your-spouse-cheating-on-you-with-money.html\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-common-behavior-is-the-no-1-predictor-of-whether-youll-get-divorced-\nhttp://news.prudential.com/content/1209/files/PrudentialWellnessProgramsCensus.pdf\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-biggest-cause-of-stress-in-america-today/\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/money-habits-are-set-by-age-7-teach-your-kids-the-value-of-a-dollar-now\nhttp://money.com/money/5157625/ideal-income-study/\n\n\nstudy also found that additional income did not create a\n\nproportionate level of happiness beyond this point.\n\nMany baby boomers are contemplating life transitions, such as\n\nretirement, succession planning and wealth transfer. As they\n\nconsider transferring their wealth, they are questioning their\n\nbeneficiaries\u2019 relationships with money and what will become of\n\ntheir nest egg.\n\nTake, for instance, the story of a family I know. Nathan and his\n\nwife, Ann, have been married 30 years. Over the years, they have\n\ndebated when they should tell their daughter, Morgan, about their\n\nwealth. The couple was concerned that learning about their wealth\n\ncould limit Morgan\u2019s ambition. Now that Morgan has established\n\nher career, Nathan and Ann are more comfortable discussing their\n\nestate. However, they cannot assume their daughter\u2019s values related\n\nto money are the same as theirs.\n\nNathan is from a family that experienced financial hardship his\n\ndaughter wasn\u2019t fully aware of growing up. However, Ann grew up\n\nmiddle class and had less fear of losing assets or being financially\n\ninsecure.\n\nAfter much agony, the couple had the talk with their daughter.\n\nNathan said the discussion went well and allowed him and his wife\n\nto share their experiences related to money growing up. Morgan left\n\nthe meeting understanding why her parents took various\n\napproaches to spending and building wealth, as well as how their\n\nlegacy should continue. The conversation also inspired her husband\n\nto have a conversation with his parents.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t done so, take time to think about your relationship\n\nwith money and how it was formed. Also, confirm that your\n\n\n\nchildren have a positive relationship with it. Key questions you\n\nshould ask yourself include:\n\n\u2022 Where do my money values come from?\n\n\u2022 Does money make me feel confident or insecure?\n\n\u2022 Do I have a history of making good financial decisions, and if not,\n\nwhy?\n\n\u2022 Am I hesitant to take action when there are issues regarding\n\nmoney?\n\n\u2022 Am I impulsive with money, or do I have the discipline to say no?\n\n\u2022 Do my children have good values with money, especially if they\n\nwill inherit it from me?\n\nIf thinking about these questions makes you feel uncomfortable,\n\nyou might not have a good relationship with money. If you do not\n\nhave a healthy relationship with it, consider consulting with a\n\nfinancial advisor to develop a strategy to correct the financial path\n\nfor you and your family. Financial health contributes to overall\n\nhealth and a better quality of life.\n\nThe information provided here is not investment, tax or financial\n\nadvice.

word because if you want to change the\n00:00:24.210 world you have to know how to pay for it\n00:00:25.710 I&#x27;m not talking about being a good\n00:00:27.570 person you can do that for free I&#x27;m\n00:00:29.599 talking about if you want to create\n00:00:31.619 something start something galvanize a\n00:00:34.649 community\n00:00:35.520 improve the lives of others run for\n00:00:37.050 office every day great ideas die on the\n00:00:40.440 vine because they don&#x27;t have capital to\n00:00:41.910 get off the ground and all of the work\n00:00:44.100 the thought the vision that goes into\n00:00:46.350 the idea isn&#x27;t worth much if you can&#x27;t\n00:00:48.450 pay your bills and while most of the\n00:00:50.760 greatest social movements in history\n00:00:52.170 were powered purely by an idea and\n00:00:55.050 people&#x27;s belief in that idea real change\n00:00:57.930 in impact require resources real people\n00:01:02.520 do this work they need real change real\n00:01:05.880 impact and resources to actually make it\n00:01:08.670 happen the people that believe in this\n00:01:10.830 work have to have the support and the\n00:01:12.840 resources to do it that&#x27;s where I come\n00:01:15.930 in I get essential resources into the\n00:01:18.150 hands of people and visionaries on the\n00:01:20.430 front lines doing work that matters we\n00:01:23.400 spend the majority of our waking hours\n00:01:24.990 working we spend more time working than\n00:01:27.210 we do with our loved ones so I decided\n00:01:29.490 early on that I have to love my work and\n00:01:31.259 it has to add value and while I would\n00:01:34.530 love to be one of these people who\n00:01:36.240 spearheads you know social change from\n00:01:39.000 the ground up and the thing I realized\n00:01:41.220 early on in my nonprofit career is that\n00:01:43.619 the thing I&#x27;m good at the thing I&#x27;m\n00:01:45.570 really good at is raising money and I\n00:01:49.140 love it I think it is a privilege to\n00:01:51.570 work alongside bold ambitious optimistic\n00:01:55.049 leaders and the organizations they serve\n00:01:56.869 so I teach people how to do the thing\n00:01:59.369 I&#x27;m good at because the more people that\n00:02:01.469 learn how to be good at my end of this\n00:02:03.240 work the more work will get done and I\n00:02:06.119 teach everyone I teach CEOs and\n00:02:09.209 presidents and boards of directors and\n00:02:12.020 Didi&#x27;s I teach development directors and\n00:02:15.110 all sorts of teams and nonprofit newbies\n00:02:17.740 social change agents and candidates I\n00:02:20.510 teach anyone that wants to do something\n00:02:22.640 extraordinary how to fund their dream my\n00:02:25.490 dream is that there will be more people\n00:02:26.750 like me doing this work well and that\n00:02:29.330 development will be an undergraduate\n00:02:30.650 course at universities so that\n00:02:32.330 fundraising animals like me will find\n00:02:35.510 this job out of the gate instead of\n00:02:37.070 discovering it years later accidentally\n00:02:38.960 I even have the curriculum developed but\n00:02:41.210 short of overhauling undergraduate\n00:02:43.010 course requirements I think tonight&#x27;s\n00:02:45.530 probably a good first step to get people\n00:02:47.510 to think about fundraising more as an\n00:02:50.690 opportunity and less as a dirty word if\n00:02:54.260 you want to change the world you have to\n00:02:56.240 know how to pay for it to do that well\n00:02:58.580 you have to understand three big things\n00:03:00.140 your feelings about wealth and money the\n00:03:03.860 importance of building relationships and\n00:03:05.870 how to ask for what you want let&#x27;s start\n00:03:09.350 at the top your feelings about wealth\n00:03:10.820 and money what is your relationship to\n00:03:13.160 money money is complicated it makes\n00:03:16.640 everyone squeamish it makes everyone act\n00:03:18.650 kind of weird anyone who&#x27;s ever had to\n00:03:20.930 split the check after dinner with\n00:03:22.400 friends can tell you this and imagine\n00:03:24.320 what it was like you know before venmo\n00:03:27.910 to help people learn how to raise money\n00:03:30.530 you have to help them understand their\n00:03:32.060 deal with money because everybody has\n00:03:33.590 baggage grow up poor baggage grow up\n00:03:36.920 rich baggage mad or envious that other\n00:03:40.160 people have more money than you baggage\n00:03:42.290 I think people with money are smarter\n00:03:44.810 than you\n00:03:45.970 baggage feel guilty that you have more\n00:03:49.970 money than other people that&#x27;s some\n00:03:52.220 first-class baggage\n00:03:55.349 still baggage people it&#x27;s still baggage\n00:03:57.629 so whatever your deal is with your\n00:04:00.659 baggage you have to reconcile it if\n00:04:02.129 you&#x27;re gonna be able to ask for money\n00:04:03.209 and here&#x27;s a little tip about asking\n00:04:05.280 people for money\n00:04:05.999 the only difference about really wealthy\n00:04:08.340 people in us is that they have more\n00:04:10.379 money than us that&#x27;s it\n00:04:12.750 don&#x27;t overcomplicate it they come with\n00:04:15.569 their own baggage when you think about\n00:04:19.168 how to do this work it&#x27;s important to\n00:04:21.839 remember that money makes the world go\n00:04:24.000 around you hear that all the time but\n00:04:25.320 it&#x27;s true whether you&#x27;re a non-profit\n00:04:26.490 for a profit or you pay your own bills\n00:04:28.729 we often feel like talking about it is\n00:04:31.380 this icky embarrassing ugly thing but\n00:04:34.139 it&#x27;s just money and it&#x27;s a fact of life\n00:04:36.810 so how you feel about it directly\n00:04:38.880 affects how you approach it like\n00:04:41.099 everyone else when I started out in this\n00:04:42.930 work I had to examine and understand my\n00:04:46.410 own feelings about wealth and money and\n00:04:48.210 I had to learn how to separate them from\n00:04:50.400 how I feel about raising money for\n00:04:52.110 important causes how I feel about asking\n00:04:54.900 for money to help people do good work in\n00:04:56.940 the world is not the same as how I feel\n00:04:58.949 about asking for money for myself this\n00:05:01.380 is an important distinction when I go\n00:05:04.139 and talk to someone I&#x27;m not asking them\n00:05:06.150 to pay my mortgage I&#x27;m giving them an\n00:05:08.909 opportunity to invest an idea that&#x27;s\n00:05:11.460 gonna change the world for the better\n00:05:12.990 why should I feel bad about that the\n00:05:16.320 answer is that I shouldn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t\n00:05:18.030 feel bad about giving them the inside\n00:05:19.620 tip on a hot stock and I&#x27;m not gonna\n00:05:21.870 feel bad about giving them the inside\n00:05:23.520 tip on empowering social change either\n00:05:25.440 if you want to be good at raising money\n00:05:28.139 you have to be able to reframe the ask\n00:05:30.270 both for yourself and for other people\n00:05:32.310 as an opportunity next you have to get\n00:05:36.360 prepared to build some relationships\n00:05:38.120 people give to people they don&#x27;t just\n00:05:40.349 give to ideas and if they don&#x27;t believe\n00:05:42.960 in the person running the place you&#x27;re\n00:05:44.190 already dead in the water this is true\n00:05:46.289 whether you&#x27;re in stocks or venture\n00:05:48.780 capital politics or nonprofits building\n00:05:52.889 a relationship with people takes work\n00:05:54.979 you have to care about more than just\n00:05:57.479 what you want or need you have to also\n00:05:59.490 value what someone else wants or need I\n00:06:01.590 know it&#x27;s a shocking terrible idea but\n00:06:04.800 oftentimes closing gifts is\n00:06:07.010 understanding the person more\n00:06:08.820 it&#x27;s important to know the product and\n00:06:10.380 if you think building a relationship\n00:06:11.910 with with people takes work building a\n00:06:14.610 relationship with someone you&#x27;re asking\n00:06:16.200 for money from takes work and it takes\n00:06:19.710 homework have you done any research do\n00:06:23.160 you have any idea what they care about\n00:06:24.600 do you know why they should invest in\n00:06:26.850 your work can you answer that question\n00:06:29.040 in less than 30 seconds if you can&#x27;t the\n00:06:31.140 meetings gonna be it&#x27;s gonna be pretty\n00:06:32.790 rough and the answer can&#x27;t be because\n00:06:34.650 they&#x27;re super rich and they live in your\n00:06:36.030 zip code when you talk to people and\n00:06:40.860 understand what they care about it has\n00:06:43.170 to be in person fundraising is\n00:06:45.270 relational it&#x27;s not transactional and\n00:06:47.400 you have to ask them questions when I\n00:06:50.850 sit down with the donor it goes\n00:06:52.140 something like this hi thanks so much\n00:06:55.560 for seeing me how have you been\n00:06:57.240 did you guys go anywhere fun over\n00:06:58.410 holiday nice I love Mexico do you always\n00:07:00.750 go to the same place oh that&#x27;s awesome\n00:07:02.670 are those your kids they&#x27;re so cute how\n00:07:04.950 old are they where are they in school oh\n00:07:07.140 that&#x27;s a great school are you guys very\n00:07:08.820 involved there your spouse is on the\n00:07:10.680 board how&#x27;s that I bet it&#x27;s a ton of\n00:07:12.180 work how do you guys meet oh it&#x27;s Santa\n00:07:14.250 Clara that&#x27;s awesome are you super\n00:07:15.870 involved in the alumni network oh that&#x27;s\n00:07:17.790 so interesting where do you guys live\n00:07:19.290 again oh that&#x27;s great is that your boat\n00:07:22.990 I literally go through all of these\n00:07:26.590 things right and you know why because\n00:07:27.910 guess what I know now I know they&#x27;re out\n00:07:30.009 a hundred and twenty grand a year in\n00:07:31.449 schooling for the next 12 years right\n00:07:33.550 spouse is on the board of the kids\n00:07:35.410 school I know they&#x27;re out 100k probably\n00:07:37.449 that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a six-figure they&#x27;re both\n00:07:39.520 involved in their school alumni and\n00:07:40.990 that&#x27;s probably 25k they told me they\n00:07:43.270 live on the Upper East Side I could look\n00:07:44.830 up their apartment online and I can find\n00:07:46.660 out what their mortgages and I know they\n00:07:48.789 own a second home in Mexico oh and they\n00:07:51.069 own a boat which is like funny money\n00:07:53.800 right so what I now understand is true\n00:07:59.139 what I now understand is their thousand\n00:08:02.229 dollar gift is probably more of a\n00:08:04.000 starter gift and I should be thinking\n00:08:06.160 about ways to to help them partner with\n00:08:09.639 us and invest in a more meaningful way I\n00:08:12.030 know this sounds a tad mercenary I&#x27;m not\n00:08:15.940 confused about how it sounds but here&#x27;s\n00:08:19.360 what I want to tell you because this is\n00:08:20.680 the part that all my clients always want\n00:08:22.509 to skip because they think it&#x27;s the\n00:08:23.680 fluff and it&#x27;s not important if you\n00:08:26.680 don&#x27;t understand what they care about\n00:08:28.150 and what they value how are you ever\n00:08:30.550 gonna be able to tell them about your\n00:08:31.900 work right I want them to fund our work\n00:08:34.510 I do but I also want them to have a\n00:08:37.089 really meaningful experience as a donor\n00:08:39.130 so that they feel like we&#x27;re partners\n00:08:41.200 and not they&#x27;re not an ATM right so it&#x27;s\n00:08:45.550 important to ask the questions because\n00:08:47.260 the more you know about them and you\n00:08:48.940 know what they value the more you can\n00:08:50.709 steer the conversation in a direction\n00:08:52.480 about your work that will resonate for\n00:08:54.010 them and once you get past the get to\n00:08:56.020 know you part you get into the fun stuff\n00:08:58.000 like why are you philanthropic at all\n00:09:00.610 right why do you invest in new ideas do\n00:09:05.380 you want giving back to be a value you\n00:09:07.180 pass on to your children can we help you\n00:09:09.100 do that it&#x27;s really awesome it&#x27;s\n00:09:12.040 meaningful and remember it&#x27;s a\n00:09:13.149 conversation it&#x27;s not a\n00:09:14.709 cross-examination it&#x27;s not an interview\n00:09:17.520 don&#x27;t walk in there and tell them\n00:09:19.810 everything you already know about them\n00:09:21.130 because you did your research you don&#x27;t\n00:09:22.240 get extra points for knowing how to use\n00:09:23.620 Google it&#x27;s 75% them talking 25% you\n00:09:29.170 listening it&#x27;s better to be a good\n00:09:30.910 listener than a good showman and once\n00:09:33.070 you understand what they care about you\n00:09:35.740 can talk to them\n00:09:36.580 what you care about right you can tell\n00:09:38.290 them about you now when you do this\n00:09:40.450 don&#x27;t get too deep into the weeds or\n00:09:42.820 you&#x27;ll lose them it&#x27;s a lot like when I\n00:09:45.040 sit down with guys in finance right and\n00:09:47.200 I say you know how&#x27;s work I&#x27;m looking\n00:09:50.800 for like a thumbs-up thumbs-down but\n00:09:53.589 what I get sometimes is like a long just\n00:10:00.360 description of how the markets are\n00:10:02.649 trending and my brain leaves my body and\n00:10:05.620 starts to think about what time I dry\n00:10:07.510 cleaner closes like I don&#x27;t have\n00:10:10.209 capacity for that and they don&#x27;t have\n00:10:12.310 capacity for that level detail of our\n00:10:13.990 work if they want it they&#x27;ll ask you the\n00:10:15.700 questions it&#x27;s it&#x27;s this this thing that\n00:10:19.570 happens over and over because I here&#x27;s\n00:10:22.120 an example I worked with the CEO once\n00:10:24.490 and I was hired to teach him how to talk\n00:10:26.440 to human people like a human person it\n00:10:30.070 was a very difficult job so he kept\n00:10:33.700 getting great donor meetings and he\n00:10:35.589 wasn&#x27;t closing any gifts and I could not\n00:10:37.899 figure out what the problem was so\n00:10:39.190 finally I was like I&#x27;m just gonna come\n00:10:40.630 with you it&#x27;s gonna be great\n00:10:41.709 so I went with him to meetings and what\n00:10:44.079 would happen was he was getting into\n00:10:45.490 such detail with the donors that their\n00:10:47.950 eyes were glazing over and then after he\n00:10:50.649 was done with his 15 minute pitch they\n00:10:53.560 literally would say this happened like\n00:10:55.300 three times in a row god that sounds\n00:10:57.910 great congratulations keep up the good\n00:11:00.790 work and that was the meeting which was\n00:11:02.620 obviously not the outcome we were\n00:11:03.850 looking for so he couldn&#x27;t understand\n00:11:06.370 what I was trying to say to him that I\n00:11:07.570 finally like in an act of sheer\n00:11:09.100 desperation was like you know what I\n00:11:13.029 love I love NASA\n00:11:15.970 I love NASA I think it is unbelievably\n00:11:20.649 amazing we have figured out how to get a\n00:11:22.510 person to the moon I think it&#x27;s awesome\n00:11:25.180 I think the idea of getting someone to\n00:11:28.510 the moon and they walk on the moon and\n00:11:30.149 god I love rocket ships I love rocket\n00:11:33.370 ships rocket ships are amazing but if\n00:11:35.769 you start to tell me about the rocket\n00:11:37.360 ship and how it gets to the moon and the\n00:11:39.430 math and the science equations on how\n00:11:41.500 the rocket ship gets to the moon I\n00:11:43.199 promise you I will hang myself with my\n00:11:45.699 own hair\n00:11:47.630 I was like that is not how you tell\n00:11:50.720 people about your work what is the need\n00:11:53.470 like what&#x27;s the point right how do you\n00:11:56.329 address the need why are you better at\n00:11:58.130 it than anybody else and what can they\n00:12:00.139 do to be what can you do to make it\n00:12:02.269 about them right how can they help you\n00:12:05.329 get to the moon that&#x27;s the good stuff if\n00:12:08.990 you&#x27;re able to do that you&#x27;re probably\n00:12:10.190 ready to make the ask now I don&#x27;t expect\n00:12:13.190 everyone to be super excited to ask\n00:12:15.170 people for money\n00:12:15.980 that&#x27;s why development is an actual\n00:12:17.899 profession and not an awkward hobby\n00:12:20.889 naturally great fundraisers love people\n00:12:24.350 they can and will talk to anyone they\n00:12:27.259 can find common ground with anyone\n00:12:29.060 they&#x27;re your friends that talk to people\n00:12:30.709 in the elevator or at the grocery store\n00:12:33.730 they believe in the work required to\n00:12:37.610 both build relationships and keep them\n00:12:39.680 and they naturally have a high tolerance\n00:12:43.759 for rejection but I don&#x27;t expect\n00:12:46.250 everyone to be a natural and you don&#x27;t\n00:12:47.810 have to be a natural to raise money you\n00:12:49.880 just have to respect the people in the\n00:12:52.250 process\n00:12:52.819 and do the work will you reconcile your\n00:12:57.889 baggage will you commit to build\n00:13:00.259 relationships if you will you&#x27;re ready\n00:13:02.689 to make the ask and the ask is\n00:13:04.850 oftentimes as simple as using the phrase\n00:13:06.860 would you consider would you consider\n00:13:09.769 becoming a monthly donor would you\n00:13:11.930 consider increasing your support to $100\n00:13:14.540 would you consider investing in our work\n00:13:16.759 at the $1,000,000 level would you\n00:13:19.370 consider does a couple of awesome things\n00:13:21.410 one it gives the donor and easy way to\n00:13:23.389 out like they can say no without it\n00:13:25.220 being yes now and to gives you a second\n00:13:27.949 ask well what would you consider\n00:13:31.269 it&#x27;s good right when you do this\n00:13:35.990 remember you&#x27;re not asking for yourself\n00:13:38.240 you&#x27;re asking on behalf of all of the\n00:13:39.920 people you serve or are touched by your\n00:13:42.139 genius this isn&#x27;t a personal favor right\n00:13:45.380 feel proud of the ask it&#x27;s incredible\n00:13:47.930 that you do this work don&#x27;t try to be\n00:13:51.050 someone you&#x27;re not you&#x27;re gonna go to\n00:13:52.250 these meetings and think you need to\n00:13:53.360 bigshot it be yourself authenticity\n00:13:55.519 matters nobody likes a phony just be\n00:13:58.100 yourself and please please don&#x27;t Harvey\n00:14:02.029 do your own ask what I mean by this is\n00:14:04.759 don&#x27;t walk into the meeting and say I\n00:14:07.310 had an IDI that did this all the time I\n00:14:09.259 stopped inviting him he&#x27;d say we&#x27;re not\n00:14:12.079 here today to ask you for money yes we\n00:14:16.639 are that&#x27;s exactly why we&#x27;re literally\n00:14:20.389 that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re here today don&#x27;t do\n00:14:23.360 that don&#x27;t say whatever you can do to\n00:14:26.209 help that is hands down the fastest way\n00:14:29.120 to get the smallest possible gift\n00:14:30.769 someone thinks they can give you and get\n00:14:32.209 away with not kidding and don&#x27;t take it\n00:14:35.630 back once you&#x27;ve made the ask would you\n00:14:37.940 consider supporting us at the $10,000\n00:14:40.279 level or the five or the two or one you\n00:14:43.250 know what take the year off you&#x27;re the\n00:14:44.480 best thanks don&#x27;t do that ask the\n00:14:48.589 question wait till ten count to ten\n00:14:51.560 before you speak again keep your face\n00:14:53.540 like this they are grown-ups they have\n00:15:00.410 all the power in this situation they can\n00:15:02.839 answer the question don&#x27;t take it back\n00:15:05.110 which brings me to my favorite don&#x27;t ask\n00:15:08.209 don&#x27;t get if you don&#x27;t make an actual\n00:15:10.699 ask no one will give you actual money\n00:15:12.769 and if no one gives you actual and money\n00:15:14.870 you actually can&#x27;t do anything with it\n00:15:16.490 it&#x27;s very simple don&#x27;t ask don&#x27;t get\n00:15:20.769 listen I would love to live in a world\n00:15:23.029 or we didn&#x27;t have to ask people for\n00:15:24.680 money to do important work that will\n00:15:27.529 change people&#x27;s lives I would love to\n00:15:29.839 not have to teach people how to make a\n00:15:31.399 case for the importance of feeding and\n00:15:33.649 housing and educating people but this is\n00:15:36.800 the world that we live in and if we&#x27;re\n00:15:38.240 committed to doing this work and doing\n00:15:40.310 it well we have to be as\n00:15:42.380 committed to the art of funding this\n00:15:43.790 work as we are to the art of executing\n00:15:45.350 it I&#x27;m going to repeat that because I\n00:15:47.660 think it&#x27;s really important we have to\n00:15:49.970 be as committed to the art of funding\n00:15:52.280 our work as we are to the art of\n00:15:54.170 executing that and

Hall\nUniversity of Florida, Gainesville,\nFlorida, USA\n\nThis article considers the importance of relationship building to community col-\n\nlege resource development efforts. It draws on concepts and theories from the \u00fcelds\n\nof public relations, fund raising, and higher education to demonstrate that stra-\n\ntegic management of relationships is a foundation of a successful resource devel-\n\nopment effort. This article discusses the conceptual link between fund raising and\n\nrelationship building. Characteristics of relationships, including trust, mutuality\n\nof control, satisfaction, and commitment are discussed, as are two types of re-\n\nlationships colleges have with their various publics: exchange and communal.\n\nImplications for practice and for future research in this area are provided. The\n\narticle concludes that because community colleges have a tradition of building\n\nclose working relationships with key organizations, institutions, and individuals\n\nin their communities, the colleges are well positioned for receiving increased levels\n\nof private support.\n\nAs the need for private support has increased at community colleges,\nGlass and Jackson (1998a; 1998b) and Jackson and Glass (2000) have\nprovided clear and insightful guidance for college leaders. They have\ndemonstrated the importance of integrating institutional planning\ninto resource development efforts, speci\ufffded the role of the president as\nthe leader of the resource development team (Glass &amp; Jackson, 1998b),\nand discussed the emerging trends and critical issues that affect fund\nraising (Jackson &amp; Glass, 2000). Resource development efforts also can\nbene\ufffdt from the well-established relationships that most community\ncolleges, their presidents, and others leaders have with key con-\nstituent groups and with in\ufffduential individual members of their\ncommunities.\n\nCommunity colleges traditionally have placed a high value on the\nestablishment of strong relationships with their communities.\n\nAddress Correspondence to Dr. Margarete Rooney Hall, University of Florida, P.O.\nBox 118400, Weimer Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611-8400, USA.

This understanding is crucial because our feelings about money can significantly influence our effectiveness in raising funds for causes we care about. For me, while I appreciate the freedom that money represents and recognize its utility in supporting causes aligned with my ideals, I am critical of the capitalist framework that prioritizes profit over communal welfare. My relationship with money is thus complex; I view it as a necessary tool within the current societal structure but advocate for a future where our systems do not revolve around monetary exchanges. This dual perspective informs my cautious yet strategic approach to managing money, ensuring it is used to support worthwhile initiatives without perpetuating the very systems I critique.\n\n### Part B: Building Relationships in Strategic Fundraising\n\nAccording to Hall (2002) and Najev \u010ca\u010dija (2013), successful fundraising is heavily reliant on the strategic building and maintaining of relationships. Hall discusses how community colleges leverage long-standing communal relationships to enhance their fundraising efforts, emphasizing the importance of trust and mutual satisfaction in these interactions (Hall, 2002). Similarly, Najev \u010ca\u010dija integrates marketing strategies with fundraising, suggesting that understanding and aligning with the values and needs of potential donors can lead to more successful fundraising outcomes (Najev \u010ca\u010dija, 2013). In my approach, I focus on genuine engagement, ensuring that interactions with potential donors and supporters are not merely transactional but foster a deep sense of mutual understanding and respect. This involves listening to their values and aligning them with the goals of the initiatives I support, thereby creating a solid foundation for ongoing partnership and support.\n\n### Part C: Strategic Elements of Fundraising\n\nFive crucial elements of fundraising require strategic planning: donor identification, engagement strategy, messaging and communication, event planning, and metrics for measuring success. First, identifying potential donors involves understanding who is most likely to support the cause based on shared values and interests. Next, developing an engagement strategy that includes personalized communication and interaction can help in maintaining donor interest and commitment. Effective messaging is crucial; it must resonate with potential donors and clearly articulate the impact of their contribution. Planning fundraising events requires attention to detail, ensuring that they provide value to attendees and effectively showcase the cause. Finally, establishing metrics for success is essential for tracking progress and making necessary adjustments to the fundraising strategy. Each of these elements must be thoughtfully planned and executed to build and sustain donor relationships effectively, ultimately supporting the broader goals of the initiative."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "41dbdf24-b984-458e-a89d-e541858839dc", "request_id": "8936b9520a0f5a0d-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "41dbdf24-b984-458e-a89d-e541858839dc", "children": ["35b69feb-64cd-4950-8f8b-58c56c6562fe"]}, "35b69feb-64cd-4950-8f8b-58c56c6562fe": {"id": "35b69feb-64cd-4950-8f8b-58c56c6562fe", "message": {"id": "35b69feb-64cd-4950-8f8b-58c56c6562fe", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1718330552.617421, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [], "rebase_system_message": true, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null, "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e5769959-59b8-4ae6-bca7-00d32b1dc146", "children": ["aaa29923-622b-4072-a8d9-2625633afafd"]}, "aaa29923-622b-4072-a8d9-2625633afafd": {"id": "aaa29923-622b-4072-a8d9-2625633afafd", "message": {"id": "aaa29923-622b-4072-a8d9-2625633afafd", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1718330552.618165, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["could you find me a schalorly source that supports or affirms the the main assertions or congectures made in this paragraph?

Even during this critical period for them, many nonprofits typically have failed to implement this type of integrated planning because their corporate culture often nurtures: an inner process focus, leadership pathologies, professional balkanisation, reluctance to accept advancement as a global organisational activity, an unwillingness to accept the realities of a moving market and a lack of political will to undertake social advocacy on behalf of their clients. \\n \\n \\n \\nIn order to succeed in the future, nonprofit organisations will need to approach strategic planning through an interdisciplinary methodology that will be shaped by multiple market audits focusing on: mission and institutional capabilities, image and competitive analysis, philanthropic feasibility and flexible integration of revenue/resource development. \\n \\n \\n \\nNonprofits that adopt this interdisciplinary process will be rewarded by enhanced fundraising returns, once re-founded on a culture that has remained mission-relevant while becoming market-driven. The nonprofit that bases its planning on more effective use of intelligence gathering and flexible focusing of its human and financial capital will be more capable of acting upon a fluid environment and realising the institution&#x27;s optimal future.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

A review of the existing theoretical and empirical studies in the field of fundraising is provided. Open questions in fundraising are addressed, with the special attention devoted to the identification of marketing activities that could ensure higher fundraising, as well as the overall performance of nonprofit organizations. Based on the existing literature, it is proposed that long-term relationships with donors and implementation of the \u2018traditional\u2019 marketing activities are crucial to fundraising, with the fundraising serving as a feedback for nonprofit strategic marketing. This paper also analyzes the situation and prospects of fundraising in the nonprofit sector in Croatia. Further suggestions for the empirical verification of the proposed theoretical model are made, along with the recommendations for future research.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Ljiljana Najev \u010ca\u010dija&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2013,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Management : Journal of Contemporary Management Issues&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/fundraising-marketing-toward-model-\u010da\u010dija/9206ce29ad5e55f3ae2f36f12b092b76/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;18&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;59-78&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:4},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Strategic planning is a deliberative, disciplined approach to producing fundamental decisions and actions that shape and guide what an organization (or other entity) is, what it does, and why it does it. Strategic planning is not a substitute for strategic thinking, acting, and learning, or for leadership. Instead, strategic planning is a leadership tool meant to enhance strategic thinking, acting, and learning. Strategic planning can produce several benefits, but there is no guarantee that it will. There are a variety of approaches to strategic planning; some approaches emphasize process, while others emphasize content.

While fundraisers often choose to announce past contributions, economic theory predicts that contributions will be largest when donors are uninformed of the contributions made by others. This paper suggests that an announcement strategy may be optimal because it helps reveal the charity\u2019s quality. It is shown that when there is imperfect information about the value of the public good and contributors can purchase information regarding its quality, then there exist equilibria in which an announcement strategy is optimal. Interestingly, in equilibrium a high-quality charity receives contributions that exceed those that would result had the quality of the charity been common knowledge. Hence, an announcement strategy not only helps worthwhile organizations reveal their type, but it also helps the fundraiser reduce the free-rider problem.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;L.

Our field study provides a unique combination of three parameters whose combined interaction has not been studied to this date: donor segment, suggested personalized donation amount and social comparison, resulting in a 3 x 3 x 2 between-subjects design. Taking into account the donor\u2019s zone of acceptable prices, we show that for acquiring and reactivating donors the use of a recently suggested donation amount is most effective, whereas for retaining donors, it is preferred to use an average amount. Our results also demonstrate that social comparison is an excellent acquisition strategy, but that it could be harmful when reactivating lapsed donors. Social comparison was not found to have an effect on the donation behavior of current donors.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

Because building relationships with donors is critical to the success of nonprofits, organisations must be able to transform their data on prospective donors into an action plan that will optimise the yield of their fundraising efforts. This paper offers a methodology for targeting individuals most likely to make a charitable contribution, by building custom response models using the rich donor data maintained by many nonprofit organisations as well as overlaid demographic information. The methodology is able to utilise efficiently a large volume of variables while being flexible enough to use large categorical variables, such as postal code, and capture non-linear relationships between the independent variables and the likelihood to give.

The study looks at the most popular types of fundraising events, as well as thank you events that are held for donors, and attempt to better understand how they differ from other events. Additionally, this study examines several popular fundraising events to see how they were promoted by analyzing their social media and websites in particular. The results of the study indicate that nonprofit events are very unique to other events in their purpose, as well as how they are marketed to potential attendees. Nonprofit event marketing must be much deeper than the marketing of other events. Promotion must motivate attendance by creating an emotional appeal that deeply connects potential attendees to an organization and its cause. Only when this connection is formed can a support-raising event be successful in raising long-term support to make a positive impact.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Anna Guinn&quot;,&quot;Yao-Yi Fu&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2023,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Events and Tourism Review&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/developing-marketing-strategy-nonprofit-events-guinn/8ea6273ba0f65430bd1413d56c35b08d/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.18060/27335&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:10},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Does Strategic Planning Improve Organizational Performance? A Meta\u2010Analysis&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Strategic planning is a widely adopted management approach in contemporary organizations. Underlying its popularity is the assumption that it is a successful practice in public and private organizations that has positive consequences for organizational performance. Nonetheless, strategic planning has been criticized for being overly rational and for inhibiting strategic thinking. This article undertakes a meta-analysis of 87 correlations from 31 empirical studies and asks, Does strategic planning improve organizational performance? A random-effects meta-analysis reveals that strategic planning has a positive, moderate, and significant impact on organizational performance. Meta-regression analysis suggests that the positive impact of strategic planning on organizational performance is strongest when performance is measured as effectiveness and when strategic planning is measured as formal strategic planning. This impact holds across sectors (private and public) and countries (U.S. and non-U.S. contexts). Implications for public administration theory, research, and practice are discussed in the conclusion.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;B. George&quot;,&quot;R.

An online survey was sent to attendees of an annual Cal Poly auction event between 2002 and 2016 that directly benefits Cal Poly students. The data were used to test a series of hypotheses to determine the fit of a proposed theoretical model. Although the study was limited by a small sample size of 74 subjects, it resulted in the creation of a revised event fundraising model. Student involvement proved to be the only quality significantly predicting a guest\u2019s overall satisfaction with the event, explaining 12% of the variance. The combination of overall event satisfaction with a subset of the revised theory of planned behavior variables (attitude, descriptive norm, and moral norm) explained 51% of the variance in predicting university loyalty. Finally, intention to donate was best predicted as a combination of prescriptive norm, attitude, and university loyalty, accounting for 57% of the variance. Overall, the revised model is applicable in aspects of university event planning including event branding, marketing, and the involvement of students at the event.

Economic impact analyses are one of the tools that policy makers can use to support effective investment decision making in event planning. The more precise and accurate these analyses are, the more helpful to event planning they will be. This paper proposes an innovative methodology to improve the economic impact estimate of events. It combines tested action-tracking technologies to track the consumer behaviour of visitors to the event (Radio Frequency IDentification \u2013 passive RFID) with bottom\u2013up Input\u2013Output models. A case study was carried out on the Festival of Economics in Trento, Italy, a cultural hallmark event aimed at high tourist flows, image-making and place branding and marketing.

Several conclusions are drawn, namely that: (1) strategic planning is likely to become part of the repertoire of public and non-profit planners; (2) planners must be very careful how they apply strategic planning to specific situations; (3) it makes sense to think of decision makers as strategic planners and strategic planners as facilitators of decision making across levels and functions; and (4) there are a number of theoretical and practical issues that still need to be explored.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Recent studies show that \\&quot;attendance\\&quot; is the most common metric used to capture the success of social events, since the number of attendees has great impact on the event&#x27;s expected gains (e.g., revenue, artist/brand publicity). In this work, we study the Social Event Scheduling (SES) problem which aims at identifying and assigning social events to appropriate time slots, so that the number of events attendees is maximized. We show that, even in highly restricted instances, the SES problem is NP-hard to be approximated over a factor. To solve the SES problem, we design three efficient and scalable algorithms. These algorithms exploit several novel schemes that we design. We conduct extensive experiments using several real and synthetic datasets, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms perform on average half the computations compared to the existing solution and, in several cases, are 3-5 times faster.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Nikos Bikakis&quot;,&quot;V.

The term is defined in this study as the process by which contributions are targeted to meet business objectives and recipient needs. It represents the integration of philanthropy into the overall strategic planning of the corporation. Given this trend, this research examines the extent to which corporate philanthropy has become predominantly a business deal with direct and measurable financial returns to shareholders. The study presents the results of a national survey of corporate direct contribution programs. The 226 corporations that responded to the mailed questionnaire were primarily large corporations from over 20 different industries. The findings suggest that contributions made directly by corporations are primarily used in less tangible ways to meet responsibilities to employees and their communities.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

One social medium not typically considered in the popular mix is virtual worlds. Using a multi-method ethnographic approach, this study contributes to the strategic communication body of knowledge by examining the purposeful usage of communication by organizations in virtual environments to build support communities and fulfill their respective fundraising missions. Through a descriptive case study, this research explores the efforts of three organizations in the 3D virtual world of Second Life: The American Cancer Society, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and Live and Learn in Kenya. These organizations have raised millions of dollars/pounds/euros from avatars. The results reveal that social capital plays an important role in the motivation and success of virtual world fundraising activities, especially for individuals who may not otherwise engage due to physical, social, or geographic barriers.

Our field study provides a unique combination of three parameters whose combined interaction has not been studied to this date: donor segment, suggested personalized donation amount and social comparison, resulting in a 3 x 3 x 2 between-subjects design. Taking into account the donor\u2019s zone of acceptable prices, we show that for acquiring and reactivating donors the use of a recently suggested donation amount is most effective, whereas for retaining donors, it is preferred to use an average amount. Our results also demonstrate that social comparison is an excellent acquisition strategy, but that it could be harmful when reactivating lapsed donors. Social comparison was not found to have an effect on the donation behavior of current donors.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

Based on recent findings regarding the effects of message framing and evidence, effective fundraising messages should combine abstract, statistical information with a negative message frame and anecdotal evidence with a positive message frame. In addition, building on research into social dilemmas, it was hypothesized that information about charity goal attainment (e.g., the contributions of others) should increase donation intentions. The hypotheses were tested in a 2 (goal attainment: yes/no)\u00d72 (framing: positive/negative)\u00d72 (evidence: statistical/anecdotal) factorial design. Abstract information was more effective when combined with a negatively framed message, whereas anecdotal information was more effective when combined with a positive frame. In addition, donation intentions were higher for messages that addressed charity goal attainment issues.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;E. Das&quot;,&quot;P. Kerkhof&quot;,&quot;J.

While fundraisers often choose to announce past contributions, economic theory predicts that contributions will be largest when donors are uninformed of the contributions made by others. This paper suggests that an announcement strategy may be optimal because it helps reveal the charity\u2019s quality. It is shown that when there is imperfect information about the value of the public good and contributors can purchase information regarding its quality, then there exist equilibria in which an announcement strategy is optimal. Interestingly, in equilibrium a high-quality charity receives contributions that exceed those that would result had the quality of the charity been common knowledge. Hence, an announcement strategy not only helps worthwhile organizations reveal their type, but it also helps the fundraiser reduce the free-rider problem.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;L.

How impactful are attempts by these organizations to utilize social media to support fundraising activities associated with online Giving Days? We address this question by testing a number of hypotheses of the effectiveness of using Facebook for fundraising purposes by all 704 nonprofits participating in Omaha Gives 2015. Using linked administrative and social media data, we find that fundraising success\u2014as measured by the number of donors and value of donations\u2014is positively associated with a nonprofit\u2019s Facebook network size (number of likes), activity (number of posts), and audience engagement (number of shares), as well as net effects of organizational factors including budget size, age, and program service area. These results provide important new empirical insights into the relationship between social media utilization and fundraising success of nonprofits.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

This study identifies the most appealing factors and analyzes the results through a multi-theory approach as follows. First, contrary to altruism and warm-glow giving theories, crowdfunding to support social impact projects does not perform well. Second, fixed campaigns, small-sized projects, and prolonged campaigns are more likely to be funded, in line with goal-setting theory. Additionally, the resource-based view of firms clarifies the importance of having large entrepreneurial teams. Further, narrative theories about persuasion and information processing provide insights into why detailed text descriptions are more persuasive than pitch videos. Finally, this study relies on social identity and signaling theories to illustrate the impressive role of social networks and discussion forums between fundraisers and backers for developing effective word-of-mouth. This paper also provides fundraisers with recommendations to building appealing campaigns.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C. Lagazio&quot;,&quot;F.

Because building relationships with donors is critical to the success of nonprofits, organisations must be able to transform their data on prospective donors into an action plan that will optimise the yield of their fundraising efforts. This paper offers a methodology for targeting individuals most likely to make a charitable contribution, by building custom response models using the rich donor data maintained by many nonprofit organisations as well as overlaid demographic information. The methodology is able to utilise efficiently a large volume of variables while being flexible enough to use large categorical variables, such as postal code, and capture non-linear relationships between the independent variables and the likelihood to give.

Employing a postal survey of ten thousand donors to causes in a variety of categories, the author concludes that although approximately one in five donors might lapse because of a change in financial circumstances, a similar number simply elect to switch their support to other organizations. The role of the quality of service offered to the donor in enhancing retention is also highlighted, as are donor perceptions of the feedback they receive and the impact they believe their gift might have on the cause.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Donor Priority Strategy and Fundraising Performance Assessed by a Propensity Score Matching Study&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Many nonprofit organizations apply a priority strategy to their donors instead of treating donors equally. The underlying assumption of this strategy is that different and preferential treatment of donors according to their donation amount positively affects fundraising performance. We conducted a propensity score matching study to analyze the fundraising strategies of seventy-three cultural organizations in Germany. The empirical findings are discussed and complemented by qualitative data from twenty interviews with fundraising managers and private donors. The results show that, in terms of fundraising performance, nonprofit organizations that apply a donor priority strategy outperform organizations that treat donors equally. A donor priority strategy ultimately leads to a 125 euro higher total revenue per donor and an 87 euro higher profit per donor due to cost savings via better use of fundraising resources.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Christian Scherhag&quot;,&quot;S.

Several direct mail framing strategies (factors) were empirically tested in a designed fractional factorial experiment that allowed the determination of not only the (main) effect of each factor, but also their interaction effects. These framing strategies included four factors: size of anchor (suggested donation), frame valence (whether a frame is expressed in positive vs. negative terms), and inclusion or not of two independent types of reference information. In addition, we studied the impact of the traditional direct marketing variables, recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM), as well as various demographic factors. Two performance measures were considered: 1) response rate, and 2) size of gift. Results indicated, among other things, that to a large extent the two measures are affected by different factors.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;P. Berger&quot;,&quot;G. E.

Moreover, crowdfunding initiatives that are structured as nonprofit organizations tend to be significantly more successful than other organizational forms in achieving their fundraising targets, even after controlling for various project characteristics. This finding is in line with theoretical arguments developed by the contract failure literature which postulates that nonprofit organizations may find it easier to attract money for initiatives that are of interest for the general community due to their reduced focus on profits.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Paul Belleflamme&quot;,&quot;T.

Most academics consider psychographic criteria as the basis for segmenting and targeting donors. In marketing practice, however, fundraisers are often confined to socio-demographic data on their target groups. This article suggests certain socio-demographic characteristics, when combined with behavioural aspects, can be traced back to fundamental dimensions that represent efficient criteria for potential donor segmentation. The authors conducted an investigation in Austria to find which individuals (as defined by age, gender and social class) donate what amounts, how frequently, to which organisations, and in which forms. Reviewing the data and their statistical results in a succeeding interpretative process, they were able to deduce three basic conditions under which individuals are particularly prone to donate: (1) when the purpose of the NPO pertains to the individual&#x27;s sphere; (2) when the individual might benefit from the services of an organisation; (3) when the donation does not represent overmuch expense and/or effort. These conditions are proposed as dimensions for selecting and targeting specific donor-segments, allowing NPOs to increase their fundraising efficiency through easy-to-get socio-demographic data.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Katharina J.

With this strategy, our fundraiser avoids lossy solicitations, significantly boosts available funds, and, consequently, can increase service and goods provision. Further, to realize these gains, the charity can merely rely on readily available data. We conclude that charities that refrain from fundraising targeting waste significant resources.

To date no one has examined the returns accruing from direct marketing activities in fund-raising. In this paper we present the results of a study of 150 UK charities currently employing a range of direct marketing tools/techniques and indicate the ROI that can be achieved through each. Cold and warm direct mailings are considered, as are reciprocal mailings, unaddressed mail, DRPA, DRTV and face-to-face (i.e., on street) recruitment. The results indicate that most charities lose money on donor recruitment activities and that the overall returns accruing to all forms of direct marketing activity are comparatively low. The implications for both professional practice and further research are explored.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A. Sargeant&quot;,&quot;E.

Open questions in fundraising are addressed, with the special attention devoted to the identification of marketing activities that could ensure higher fundraising, as well as the overall performance of nonprofit organizations. Based on the existing literature, it is proposed that long-term relationships with donors and implementation of the \u2018traditional\u2019 marketing activities are crucial to fundraising, with the fundraising serving as a feedback for nonprofit strategic marketing.

He identifies six empirical studies published since 2014 that indicate the importance of elements of donor social identity, such as demographics, motivation, and the nature of the donation itself. He concludes that social identity theory is a fine lens for management of donor information. This evidence is important because maintaining donor relations is usually a top priority for nonprofit organizations. Gold discovers evidence in the sciences of management that supports specific recommendations for nonprofit practice, such as keenly tracking: donor profiles, donor segments, and bonding opportunities with donors. ABSTRACT The purpose of this topic paper is to determine whether nonprofits can increase their fundraising capabilities by better managing their donors\u2019 social identities. The nonprofit sector in the United States generated nearly $1.9 trillion in gross output, is estimated to contribute 5.6% toward the country\u2019s $25.5 trillion in gross domestic product (GDP), and contributes immeasurable benefits to society. The industry continues to face challenges as the demand for services has increased and fundraising difficulties persist. This article analyzes peer-reviewed articles focused on nonprofit fundraising using a systematic approach. My findings suggest that one of the keys to effective nonprofit fundraising is the management of information on donors\u2019 social identity. Appropriately, social identity theory is seen as an effective lens with which to meet this challenge. Several essential aspects of donor identities emerge from the research, including their demographic profiles and their motivations to give. In addition, how donors choose to give, what they actually give, and why they select one cause over another are key considerations that contribute to social identity.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

In contrast, business has understood that the customer experience is vital to their success (Bitner &amp; Brown, 2008; Lusch, Vargo &amp; O\u2019Brien, 2007; Martin, 1999). Services marketing theory describes the role of the customer in \u2018co-creating\u2019 their experience to increase customer satisfaction (Gr\u00f6nroos, 1994). Fundraisers now recognise that how donors feel about their experience of fundraising is crucial. Community fundraising is driven by donors who organise and deliver their own fundraising events and experiences. But there is a gap in our knowledge about the role donors play in creating their own experience and the effect on donor satisfaction. Aim To examine whether academic models derived from services marketing literature can be applied to community and supporter-led fundraising to improve the donor experience. In particular, we examine the concept of value and the role of the donor in value creation. Methods A literature review was conducted which highlighted the limited research available. Consequently, an exploratory approach was adopted. Empirical primary data was captured through a series of interviews at case study organisations. Three case studies were identified within a specific typology of organisation: hospice charities that fundraise using similar techniques within their local communities. Results The concept of value-in-use described by Gr\u00f6nroos (1994) and the role of the donor as an independent creator of value in the customer sphere (Gr\u00f6nroos &amp; Voima, 2013) was supported by the research and can be applied to the donor experience. Conclusion It has never been more important for fundraisers to deliver an excellent donor experience. Fundraisers must employ coaching and facilitation skills to empower supporters to create value. Further research is required to ascertain how managers of fundraising can deliver service encounters and tangible resources that best facilitate the creation of value for the donor.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Community-based small nonprofit organizations are more vulnerable to the constantly changing political, economic, financial, and demographic environment (Mara, 2010). Strategic planning can serve as a management tool for capacity building of small nonprofits and help organizations develop strategic thinking and adapt to environmental changes (Bryson, 2011). Yet, strategic planning takes time and costs extra human capital and monetary resources that small nonprofits do not have (Mara, 2010). To address this dilemma, this study examines the application of strategic planning to small nonprofit organizations, which has been less studied.A large number of studies have examined the organizational and environmental factors influencing the use of strategic planning, strategy formulation and implementation, and the impact of strategic planning on organizational performance outcomes (Crittenden &amp; Crittenden, 2000; Poister &amp; Streib, 2005; Poister, Pitts, &amp; Edwards, 2010; Siciliano, 2006; Stone, Bigelow, &amp; Crittenden, 1999). Strategic planning has demonstrated potential for improving social performance and financial performance for small nonprofit organizations (Siciliano, 2006). Yet, most of the existing studies on strategic planning in the nonprofit sector have focused on the well-established nonprofit organizations, while few case studies have explored the benefits and challenges of utilizing strategic planning and management in smaller, less established organizations (Mara, 2000). Knowledge remains limited about the use of strategic planning in small nonprofit organizations. Hence, it is worthwhile to identify the role of strategic planning and management for small nonprofit organizations in their management and capacity building.This research examines the following questions: Can strategic planning help small nonprofits improve management and performance? What are the major challenges facing small nonprofit organizations when using strategic planning in their management practice? To answer these questions, we conducted an online survey and focus group studies of executive directors and senior staff of small nonprofit organizations in a southeastern state in the United States. This research suggests that with leadership and other organizational support, small nonprofit organizations can use strategic planning to develop and sustain in an uncertain economic environment.Literature Review &amp; BackgroundConsiderable literature has focused on the adoption and implementation of strategic planning in public, private, and nonprofit organizations (Allison &amp; Kaye, 2005; Bryson, 2011; Moore, 2000; Morrisette &amp; Oberman, 2013; Poister et al., 2010). This section begins with reviewing the impacts of strategic planning on public and nonprofit organizations, and then addresses the potential benefits of strategic planning for small nonprofit organizations. Next, it identifies factors influencing the use of strategic planning in nonprofit organizations and discusses the challenges facing strategic planning for community-based nonprofit organizations.Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit OrganizationsSince the 1980s, strategic planning has been widely adopted by public, private, and nonprofit organizations (Bryson, 2011; Heriot, &amp; Loughman, 2009; Mintzberg, 1993; Moore, 2000; Poister &amp; Streib, 1999; 2005; Poister, et al., 2010). According to Bryson (2011), strategic planning is \\&quot;a deliberative, disciplined approach to producing fundamental decisions and actions that shape and guide what an organization (or other entity) is, what it does, and why\\&quot; (p. 7-8). There are core steps of strategic planning across a large number of studies (Allison &amp; Kaye, 2005; Bryson, 2011; Moore, 2000). \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Q. Hu&quot;,&quot;N.

In the UK, the proportion of households electing to support charity is continuing a twenty year decline. This factor, combined with the accompanying and sharp increase in the number of registered charities has contributed to the creation of an ever more hostile fundraising environment. If they are to survive, charities seeking funds from individual donors will have to refine both the quality and targeting of their fundraising campaigns. It is the purpose of this article to develop a comprehensive model of giving behaviour to assist them in this process. The article draws on literature from the fields of marketing, economics, clinical psychology, social psychology, anthropology and sociology. The implications of the resultant model for fundraising strategy are discussed and opportunities for further research delineated.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

We analyze 187 experimental research articles focusing on fundraising, published in journals across diverse disciplines between 2007-2019. Interest in studying fundraising spans many disciplines, each of which tends to focus on different aspects, supporting earlier claims that fundraising has no single academic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home.\u00e2\u20ac Most of the literature focuses on two key areas: the philanthropic environment in which fundraising occurs, largely focused on potential donors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experiences, preferences, and motivations; and testing fundraising tactics and techniques that result in different behavior by potential donors. More than 40% of the experiments were published in Economics journals. Correspondingly, topics such as warm glow and mechanisms such as lotteries, raffles, and auctions are well represented. Experimental studies largely omit the practical and the ethical considerations of fundraisers and of beneficiaries. For instance, studies focusing on the identified victim phenomenon often stereotype beneficiaries in order to foster guilt among donors and thereby increase giving. We identify several opportunities for research to examine new questions to support ethical and effective fundraising practice and nonprofit administration.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Arguing that philanthropy has moved in the opposite direction from what a social relations theory posited, the article identifies and examines organizational forms that provide donors today with opportunities for increased control by creating new relationships of (a) donor exclusivity (donor networks, giving circles), (b) donor intermediaries between donors and philanthropic advisors and providers of other services including donor-advised funds, and (c) donor oversight between \u201csocial investors\u201d and their nonprofit \u201cpartners\u201d in high-engagement philanthropy. These categories emerged from a critical review of recent literature. The article concludes with an explanation for increased donor control that is then applied to suggest how to elevate the influence of recipient groups over charitable gifts and bring greater balance into the social relationship between donor and recipient groups.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Susan A.

As suggested by Robinson and Pearce (1984), the content of strategies remains a key focus of management research, particularly for analysts of small businesses. Recent research by Shrader, Mulford, and Blackman (1989) confirms the importance of operational planning for small-firm performance. Noteworthy examples of this general research focus include the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategy (PIMS) studies of profitability, as related to market strategies conducted for large businesses, and a recent attempt by O&#x27;Neill and Duker (1986) to address the relevance of PIMS-type strategies for small businesses. O&#x27;Neill and Duker conclude that indicators similar to those for large firms as to the content of management strategy can be used as guidelines in assessing the performance of small businesses. However, their empirical analysis is based on a very limited data sample, and the specification of their model of firm success derives from the relatively limited PIMS literature, which has a substantially large-firm, market-share orientation. In this article, we examine the O&#x27;Neill-Duker proposition that there is a consistent relationship between selected economic measures of the content of operating and financial strategies and the likelihood that firms will earn profit, with particular attention to differences between small and large corporations and between industries. The objective is to determine which strategic factors have the most consistent effects on the success or failure status of firms. First, the relationship between strategic indicators and profit or loss status for all firm sizes in all industries is considered. This represents a substantial extension of the scope of previous work on these connections. Then, the relationship between the several economic indicators and the likelihood of earning profits for small and large businesses is examined. LITERATURE REVIEW Following the PIMS approach, O&#x27;Neill and Duker (1986) select five indicators that reflect familiar functional areas of management. The indicators, which characterize the content of strategic management as it may relate to successful performance, include the level of marketing expenditures, product quality, the quality of service, capital intensity, and the level of debt. Using the results of a questionnaire sent to a sample of successful and unsuccessful (i.e., bankrupt) small businesses, the authors determine that failed firms exhibited significantly lower product quality, higher capital intensity, and higher levels of debt than successful firms. On the basis of their findings, O&#x27;Neill and Duker suggest that indicators of possible economic hazards similar to those developed for large firms can be used to enhance the strategic planning and performance of small businesses. However, their survey sample was drawn from business listings for the state of Connecticut only, and yielded data for only 43 firms, of which 11 had failed. Consequently, these findings should be viewed as, at best, preliminary. Serious questions arise about the transferability of these results to other geographic regions, applicability across all industry classifications, and relevance across all firm sizes. Therefore, the question of whether the content of strategies (and the economic hazards involved therein) chosen by successful large firms can be applied to small businesses remains unsettled. In their survey article, Robinson and Pearce (1984) reach a similar conclusion. They indicate that noteworthy research findings on the importance of strategy variables to small-firm performance remain fairly specific to individual sectors of American industry, e.g., Robinson, Logan, and Salem (1986) on retailing, and Dess and Davis (1982) on manufacturing. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;John W.

Recent reviews have underscored the importance of the issue and have pointed to gaps in our knowledge of planning/performance relationships.&#x27; A basic comclusion of these reviews has been that few studies have adequately addressed the issue because of measurement and conceptual problems. Of particular importance has been the manner in which the independent planning variables have been operationalized. Few studies have measured strategic and operational planning in ways that can be replicated. Furthermore, the dependent variable, performance, has been measured many ways and has seldom been examined over relevant time periods. Additionally, the literature has clearly highlighted the importance of organization context and uncertainty in determining planning/performance relations. Indeed, strategic planning has been considered more or less salient due to organization type, relevant industry, and environmental uncertainty. The purpose of the present study is to partially address these concerns. The study examines strategic planning/ performance relationships for a stratified random sample of small firms in three major industry sectors over a three-year time period. It also is an investigation of the degree to which environmental uncertainty affects both strategic and operational planning. Specific issues addressed in the study include: (1) the relationships of strategic planning, and operational or functional area planning with performance over time for small businesses using a planning scale which measures degree of planning effort and degree of formality, as well as scales measuring functional area planning efforts; (2) and the differences in strategic planning/performance relationships and in environmental uncertainty in manufacturing, retail, and service sectors. Strategic Planning and Performance We conceive of a strategic plan as: a written long-range plan, which includes both a corporate mission statement and a statement of organizational objectives. A strategic plan includes strategies indicating how objectives will be accomplished. Strategic planning is also considered to provide the substance from which overall company performance can be controlled and measured. Operational planning, on the other hand, is defined as the setting of short-term objectives for specific functional areas such as finance, marketing, and personnel. Strategic plans are more general and have longer time horizons than do operational plans. Strategic plans normally cover a one-to-five-year time period, whereas operational plans cover periods of less than a year. Operational plans are expressed in more day-to-day terms. Operational plans might include written inventory and sales forecasts; and financial, human resource, and advertising budgets; for monthly or quarterly time periods. A number of early studies have suggested a simple positive relationship between formal strategic planning and organizational performance, and have generally concluded that planners outperformed nonplanners, the premise being that formal plans are superior to informal plans because the process of writing the plan forces ideas and objectives to be thought out. Indeed, a recent study by Robinson and Pearce suggests that the more sophisticated the planning process, the better the organizational performance. 7 Other studies suggesting a positive relationship between strategic planning and performance have been numerous. However, not all research has yielded positive results. Several recent studies have found either non-significant or negative relations. As an explanation of inconsistent findings, several reviews have concluded that variety in the measurement of strategic planning has precluded meaningful comparison of findings across studies. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Charles B.

Individual donors and fundraisers provide the resources to enable other people (or animals) to be supported. The purpose of this paper is to address this service management challenge through new types of customer service interactions that bring together service donors and service recipients through innovative digital communication.Design/methodology/approachBased on a review, and illustrated by recent examples of innovative best practice, the authors develop a new conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between customer participation and service brand communication.FindingsThe paper starts by identifying the problem of \u201cnonprofit service disintermediation\u201d. The paper also outlines the inadequacies of popular frameworks of communication, widely taught in business schools, to understand the new reality of customer-service organisation engagement in the digital age. Through adopting a customer engagement lens, the paper develops a new conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between customer participation and service brand communication.Research limitations/implicationsGiven the authors\u2019 focus on the intersection between new communication opportunities and customer service interactions, this paper adds novel insight to theory and raises important implications for management.Originality/valueThe paper explores how, through these new communication interactions, engagement with, and loyalty to, the brand is built over time in a fluid and dynamic way. It identifies a disintermediated relationship, distinct to other service contexts, but significant in terms of value and social impact.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Sarah-Louise Mitchell&quot;,&quot;Moira Clark&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2022,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Journal of Service Management&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/rethinking-service-disintermediation-service-mitchell/621dffdbc2f0533bb9df86924900d60d/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1108/josm-10-2021-0401&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:17},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Fundraising design: key issues, unifying framework, and open puzzles&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;We offer a unified conceptual, behavioral, and econometric framework for optimal fundraising that deals with both synergies and discrepancies between approaches from Economics, Marketing, Psychology, and Sociology.

The authors summarize the main findings to date and synthesize the different theoretical explanations for the decision-making behavior of the crowd. The investigation reveals how the literature to date has upheld the importance of crowdfunding as a social and democratic tool, one that demonstrates wise judgment and clairvoyance in recognizing potential successes and creating value for society.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;In\u00e9s Alegre&quot;,&quot;Melina Moleskis&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2019,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/beyond-financial-motivations-crowdfunding-systematic-alegre/469990b457415badaa88c54fbdf79243/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1007/s11266-019-00173-w&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;32&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;276 - 287&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:20}]}"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"invoked_plugin": {"type": "remote", "namespace": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin", "plugin_id": "g-f1286ecb04957580332cda9bf386b57ef1b2ed6f", "http_response_status": 200}, "jit_plugin_data": {"from_server": {"type": "preview", "body": {"domain": "chat.consensus.app", "is_consequential": false, "privacy_policy": "https://consensus.app/home/privacy-policy/", "method": "get", "path": "/quick_search", "operation": "search_papers", "params": {"query": "strategic elements of fundraising donor identification engagement strategy communication event planning metrics for success", "study_types": ["literature review", "systematic review"], "human": true}, "actions": []}}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "c01a29a2-0bfb-47d1-a9a3-5530c6bc80b9", "request_id": "8936bd1fde200e1b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c01a29a2-0bfb-47d1-a9a3-5530c6bc80b9", "children": ["507e0425-1538-46d9-9bff-054acedb9135"]}, "507e0425-1538-46d9-9bff-054acedb9135": {"id": "507e0425-1538-46d9-9bff-054acedb9135", "message": {"id": "507e0425-1538-46d9-9bff-054acedb9135", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1718330562.762517, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I found a scholarly source that supports the main assertions made in your paragraph about strategic elements of fundraising.

First, identifying potential donors involves understanding who is most likely to support the cause based on shared values and interests. Next, developing an engagement strategy that includes personalized communication and interaction can help in maintaining donor interest and commitment. **(Hanson, 1997)** elaborates on the importance of integrating strategic, marketing, and fundraising planning to enhance fundraising success. Effective messaging is crucial; it must resonate with potential donors and clearly articulate the impact of their contribution. **(Das, Kerkhof, &amp; Kuiper, 2008)** found that strategic framing and evidence in fundraising messages significantly increase donation intentions.\n\nPlanning fundraising events requires attention to detail, ensuring that they provide value to attendees and effectively showcase the cause. **(Weinstein, 2002)** discusses the need for thorough preparation and execution of special events to maximize fundraising potential. Finally, establishing metrics for success is essential for tracking progress and making necessary adjustments to the fundraising strategy. **(Sargeant, 2001)** emphasizes the role of understanding donor lifetime value in developing effective fundraising strategies, while **(Verhaert &amp; Van den Poel, 2011)** highlight the importance of tailoring donation requests based on donor lifecycle to improve campaign success rates.\n\nEach of these elements must be thoughtfully planned and executed to build and sustain donor relationships effectively, ultimately supporting the broader goals of the initiative.\n\n### Full References for Citations:\n- Hanson, J.

in the New Green Deal or Biden\u2019s Plan for Clean Energy Revolution &amp; Environmental Justice. Analyze and describe the interdependent factors that would be necessary to consider for the initiative to be successful. What elements are likely to impact the implementation (i.e., having a national carbon footprint of net zero by 2050 and converting fossil fuel dependency)? Within that initiative, what industries may be most affected? How might you engage them as active stakeholders in being part of the proposed transition? What might be one creative way of piloting the initiative or creating a tracking system for such a large-scale endeavor? What and how would you measure?\n\n\nThe Green New Deal (GND) represents a comprehensive approach to steering the U.S. economy from its historical reliance on fossil fuels towards a sustainable and equitable future. This transformative plan entails substantial government financing and broad political support, weaving together environmental and social initiatives to ensure economic growth does not come at the expense of environmental health. According to Pianta and Lucchese (2020), the GND&#x27;s strength lies in its bold challenge to capitalist norms that typically prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability and equity. \nHowever, the implementation of the GND is poised to face considerable challenges from sectors deeply entrenched in fossil fuel usage, such as the energy and automotive industries. These sectors are likely to resist shifts that threaten their established business models (Biden, 2020). Moreover, the transition will need to surmount significant technological and logistical hurdles to achieve ambitious goals, including a national carbon footprint of net zero by 2050. Galvin and Healy (2020) advocate for engaging these industries through innovative strategies that include incentives for adopting green technologies and creating collaborative frameworks to facilitate meaningful contributions to the transition. \nA practical step towards actualizing this large-scale transformation could involve setting up region-specific pilot programs that focus on converting public transportation systems to renewable energy sources. Such initiatives would not only test the feasibility of these changes on a smaller scale but also refine the methodologies for broader application. Concurrently, implementing a comprehensive tracking system using advanced data analytics and real-time monitoring would allow for the evaluation of progress in emissions reduction, job creation in emerging energy sectors, and shifts in energy production and consumption patterns. These metrics are crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the GND and ensuring the transition is responsive and adaptive to ongoing developments (Ocasio-Cortez, 2019). \nMoreover, championing personal sustainable practices plays a vital role in supporting the GND&#x27;s objectives. By opting for energy-efficient appliances, electric vehicles, and zero-waste lifestyles, individuals can significantly reduce their carbon footprints and foster a cultural shift towards sustainability. Promoting such personal decisions not only bolsters community resilience but also pressures traditional capitalist markets to adapt to the increasing demand for sustainable products and practices. This shift could corner market-driven entities into adopting greener practices or risk losing their customer base. \nThe visionary strategy of the Green New Deal marks a crucial step toward a more sustainable and equitable future, challenging entrenched economic structures and setting a precedent for comprehensive global policy actions. However, it is important to recognize the theoretical nature of such a sweeping proposal. Realistically, the Green New Deal, with its deep-rooted challenges to prevailing capitalist paradigms, might face slow adoption unless propelled by immediate and critical necessities (Durand, 2019). Historical precedents show that significant shifts in policy and public mindset often require pressing catalysts\u2014such as major wars, global pandemics, or other existential threats. In the absence of such urgent imperatives, the radical overhaul envisioned by the Green New Deal could encounter substantial resistance, both politically and socially. The integration of its ambitious policies into mainstream governance would likely necessitate either a profound societal shift driven by the increasing impacts of climate change or a revolutionary change in political will, both of which would compel a reevaluation of current economic and social practices. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### Sources Cited:\n- Pianta, M., &amp; Lucchese, M.

Achieving this goal will require a multifaceted approach that integrates regulatory measures, physical infrastructure development, and strategic public messaging, while addressing social and economic barriers. According to Pianta and Lucchese (2020), the comprehensive nature of the GND is its strength, challenging traditional capitalist norms that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability and equity.\n\nRegulatory measures will be a cornerstone of this transition. Key steps include establishing a carbon pricing system to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which could be implemented through carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs. Additionally, setting mandatory targets for renewable energy production will ensure a gradual shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources. Enforcing stricter emissions standards for industries, vehicles, and buildings will be essential to minimize carbon output (Galvin &amp; Healy, 2020). These regulatory measures are crucial as they create the framework within which all other changes must occur.\n\nDeveloping the necessary physical infrastructure is equally critical. This involves building and expanding infrastructure for solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources, which will form the backbone of a sustainable energy system. Upgrading the electric grid to handle increased loads from renewable energy sources and ensure reliability is also necessary. Moreover, significant investments in efficient and clean public transportation options will reduce reliance on fossil-fuel-powered vehicles, thus lowering overall emissions (Biden, 2020). Each of these infrastructure developments supports the others, creating a cohesive system for sustainable energy and transportation.\n\nAddressing social and economic barriers will be vital to the success of the transition. Industries reliant on fossil fuels may resist changes, but engaging these stakeholders through incentives, subsidies for green technologies, and transitional support can mitigate resistance. Providing training and support for workers transitioning from fossil fuel industries to renewable energy sectors will be necessary to avoid economic displacement and ensure a skilled workforce. Ensuring that the benefits of the transition are equitably distributed, particularly for marginalized communities disproportionately affected by climate change, will foster social cohesion and broad support (Ocasio-Cortez, 2019). This multifaceted approach ensures that no group is left behind in the transition.\n\nEffective communication is essential for garnering public support and driving behavioral change. Public awareness campaigns can educate the public on the benefits of the transition and the urgent need for action to combat climate change. Community engagement is crucial; involving local communities in decision-making processes and pilot projects can build trust and collaboration. Highlighting successful case studies and pilot programs will demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the transition, encouraging wider acceptance and participation (Durand, 2019). Each of these communication strategies supports the overall goal by building a well-informed and engaged public.\n\nThe potential benefits of a decade-long re-boot of United States development focused on sustainability are numerous. These include significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and improved air and water quality, which are critical for environmental health. Economic growth can be driven by the creation of new jobs in the renewable energy sector and technological innovation. Additionally, reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels will enhance national security, while decreased pollution-related health issues will lower healthcare costs and improve the quality of life (Pianta &amp; Lucchese, 2020). These benefits demonstrate the far-reaching positive impacts of the transition.\n\nImplementing effective feedback loops is essential for monitoring progress and ensuring resource management and sustainability. Utilizing advanced data analytics and IoT (Internet of Things) technology to monitor emissions, energy consumption, and resource use in real-time will provide accurate and timely information. Establishing clear metrics for tracking progress, such as the reduction in carbon emissions, increase in renewable energy capacity, and job creation in green sectors, will be crucial. Mandating regular reporting from industries and local governments on their sustainability efforts and outcomes, alongside creating publicly accessible dashboards to display progress, will engage citizens and provide transparency (Galvin &amp; Healy, 2020). These feedback mechanisms ensure that the transition remains on track and responsive to emerging challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, while the transition to a net-zero carbon footprint by 2050 is a monumental challenge, it is feasible with comprehensive regulatory measures, infrastructure development, effective public messaging, and strong stakeholder engagement. The potential benefits of such a transition are vast, encompassing environmental, economic, and social improvements.

Achieving this goal will require a multifaceted approach that integrates regulatory measures, physical infrastructure development, and strategic public messaging, while addressing social and economic barriers. According to Pianta and Lucchese (2020), the comprehensive nature of the GND is its strength, challenging traditional capitalist norms that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability and equity.\n\nRegulatory measures will be a cornerstone of this transition. Key steps include establishing a carbon pricing system to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which could be implemented through carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs. Additionally, setting mandatory targets for renewable energy production will ensure a gradual shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources. Enforcing stricter emissions standards for industries, vehicles, and buildings will be essential to minimize carbon output (Galvin &amp; Healy, 2020). These regulatory measures are crucial as they create the framework within which all other changes must occur.\n\nDeveloping the necessary physical infrastructure is equally critical. This involves building and expanding infrastructure for solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources, which will form the backbone of a sustainable energy system. Upgrading the electric grid to handle increased loads from renewable energy sources and ensure reliability is also necessary. Moreover, significant investments in efficient and clean public transportation options will reduce reliance on fossil-fuel-powered vehicles, thus lowering overall emissions (Biden, 2020). Each of these infrastructure developments supports the others, creating a cohesive system for sustainable energy and transportation.\n\nAddressing social and economic barriers will be vital to the success of the transition. Industries reliant on fossil fuels may resist changes, but engaging these stakeholders through incentives, subsidies for green technologies, and transitional support can mitigate resistance. Providing training and support for workers transitioning from fossil fuel industries to renewable energy sectors will be necessary to avoid economic displacement and ensure a skilled workforce. Ensuring that the benefits of the transition are equitably distributed, particularly for marginalized communities disproportionately affected by climate change, will foster social cohesion and broad support (Ocasio-Cortez, 2019). This multifaceted approach ensures that no group is left behind in the transition.\n\nEffective communication is essential for garnering public support and driving behavioral change. Public awareness campaigns can educate the public on the benefits of the transition and the urgent need for action to combat climate change. Community engagement is crucial; involving local communities in decision-making processes and pilot projects can build trust and collaboration. Highlighting successful case studies and pilot programs will demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the transition, encouraging wider acceptance and participation (Durand, 2019). Each of these communication strategies supports the overall goal by building a well-informed and engaged public.\n\nThe potential benefits of a decade-long re-boot of United States development focused on sustainability are numerous. These include significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and improved air and water quality, which are critical for environmental health. Economic growth can be driven by the creation of new jobs in the renewable energy sector and technological innovation. Additionally, reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels will enhance national security, while decreased pollution-related health issues will lower healthcare costs and improve the quality of life (Pianta &amp; Lucchese, 2020). These benefits demonstrate the far-reaching positive impacts of the transition.\n\nImplementing effective feedback loops is essential for monitoring progress and ensuring resource management and sustainability. Utilizing advanced data analytics and IoT (Internet of Things) technology to monitor emissions, energy consumption, and resource use in real-time will provide accurate and timely information. Establishing clear metrics for tracking progress, such as the reduction in carbon emissions, increase in renewable energy capacity, and job creation in green sectors, will be crucial. Mandating regular reporting from industries and local governments on their sustainability efforts and outcomes, alongside creating publicly accessible dashboards to display progress, will engage citizens and provide transparency (Galvin &amp; Healy, 2020). These feedback mechanisms ensure that the transition remains on track and responsive to emerging challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, while the transition to a net-zero carbon footprint by 2050 is a monumental challenge, it is feasible with comprehensive regulatory measures, infrastructure development, effective public messaging, and strong stakeholder engagement. Although the GND has not yet been fully implemented, it remains a viable strategy for addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. As Biden (2020) emphasizes, this initiative will create over 10 million new good-paying jobs in the clean economy across the United States, making it an enormous opportunity. The potential benefits of such a transition are vast, encompassing environmental, economic, and social improvements. By starting with small, targeted pilot programs and scaling up successful initiatives, the United States can pave the way for a sustainable and equitable future.\n\n### References\n\nBiden, J.

Global action requires American leadership,\n00:02:24.561 But the United States only accounts for only 15% of global carbon emissions.\n00:02:29.274 The rest of the world has to step up as well.\n00:02:31.818 On day one I will immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.\n00:02:36.030 But that\u2019s not sufficient.\n00:02:37.365 We need to dramatically accelerate our worldwide efforts to meet the intensity of this challenge we face\n00:02:42.996 So I\u2019ll immediately get to work\u2014\n00:02:44.622 leading a diplomatic initiative to get every nation to go beyond their initial commitment\u2014 to push our progress further, and faster.\n00:02:52.839 This is especially true for China\u2014\n00:02:55.175 by far the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon.\n00:02:58.219 We\u2019ll not only hold their leaders accountable for reducing carbon output at home in their country,\n00:03:03.183 but make sure they stop financing billions of dollars of dirty fossil fuel projects all across Asia\u2014\n00:03:09.480 And this will allow us to keep creating good-paying jobs right here at home,\n00:03:13.860 even as we raise our own standards.\n00:03:16.905 America once again will be able to stand proudly on the world stage\n00:03:20.491 And challenge every other nation to follow our example and our leadership.\n00:03:25.705 For more than three decades, I have led on this issue.\n00:03:28.583 I wrote one of the first climate change bills ever introduced in the United States Senate.\n00:03:33.379 As Vice President, I oversaw the single largest investment in clean energy in our nation\u2019s history \u2013\n00:03:39.220 over $90 billion.\n00:03:41.846 I fought along with President Obama to double the efficiency of our cars\u2014\n00:03:45.767 Which would reduce our oil consumption by 12 billion barrels,\n00:03:50.647 and for a Clean Power Plan\u2014that limited carbon emissions from both existing and new power plants.\n00:03:56.945 As President, I will lead America \u2013 and the world \u2013not only to confront the crisis in front of us \u2013\n00:04:02.367 but to seize the opportunity it presents.\n00:04:05.036 I will use every authority available to me to drive progress. And I will not accept half-measures.\n00:04:11.709 Because making these revolutionary changes is going to take an incredible commitment at all levels,\n00:04:17.089 but I am absolutely confident, that\u2019s what the American people want to do, and we can meet this challenge.\n00:04:23.846 Because this is what America does best\u2014solve big problems, with big ideas.\n00:04:28.726 That\u2019s who we are.

Biden emphasizes the need for drastic action to address climate change, highlighting the severe impacts of climate disasters already occurring, such as more severe storms, droughts, rising sea levels, and shrinking ice sheets (Biden, 2020). He underscores the urgency of implementing his plan, which aims to transform the U.S. into a 100% clean-energy economy by 2050 with net-zero emissions.\n\nHowever, implementing such an ambitious plan is poised to face considerable challenges from sectors deeply entrenched in fossil fuel usage, such as the energy and automotive industries. These sectors are likely to resist shifts that threaten their established business models. Biden acknowledges the difficulty of this transition, noting that it will require an enormous commitment at all levels and will involve holding polluters accountable, especially those who have caused significant damage in low-income and marginalized communities (Biden, 2020). This resistance from entrenched industries is a substantial barrier that needs to be overcome through strategic engagement and incentivization.\n\nBiden&#x27;s plan includes substantial investments in researching and developing zero-carbon technologies, which he asserts will create more than 10 million new good-paying jobs across the clean economy in the United States. This initiative will not only support the domestic economy but also position America as a leader in exporting clean energy technologies globally (Biden, 2020). This aspect of the plan aims to engage industries by providing economic incentives to transition towards sustainable practices, thereby reducing resistance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the transition to a net-zero carbon footprint by 2050 as proposed in the Green New Deal and Biden\u2019s plan is a monumental challenge, it remains a viable strategy. It will require comprehensive regulatory measures, substantial investments in infrastructure, and effective public messaging to overcome resistance from entrenched fossil fuel industries. By engaging stakeholders through incentives and support, and starting with small, targeted pilot programs, the United States can pave the way for a sustainable and equitable future. The transcript affirms that despite the challenges, with strong leadership and commitment, the ambitious goals of the plan are achievable.\n\n### References\n\nBiden, J. (2020).

We focus on two of its most striking characteristics: its\nmacroeconomics; and its inextricable linkage of climate change mitigation and the reduction of economic in-\nequality. We find Sanders\u2019 GND economically credible and argue that the GND&#x27;s use of Keynesian demand-side\nmacroeconomics challenges governments, policymakers and citizens to think anew about the nature of money.\nWe suggest social scientists need to challenge neoclassical economic assumptions, which, we argue, enable both\nclimate destruction and inequality to continue. We find the GND&#x27;s combining of climate protection and equality\ncredible, and argue that shifting the debate away from neoclassical understandings of public debt to careful\nassessments of inflationary impacts and resource needs will generate more productive analysis. We offer these\ninsights as a first look at the GND and challenge others to join in this research.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe IPCC reports that limiting global mean temperature increase to\n1.5 C will require net CO2 emissions to fall by about 45% by 2030 and\nreach net zero emissions by 2050 [1]. Achieving this target within 10\nyears necessitates \u201crapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land,\nurban and infrastructure and industrial systems \u2026unprecedented in\nterms of scale\u201d ( [1]:17). Attempting to meet this challenge within the\nUS, the Green New Deal (GND) resolution introduced by US Con-\ngresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey sparked\na large global reaction [2]. Co-signed by 111 US Federal legislators, it\nwas endorsed by the majority of the Democratic Party&#x27;s 2020 Pre-\nsidential frontrunners. Its chief aims are to radically decarbonize the US\neconomy while significantly reducing economic inequality, in such a\nway that these two achievements would be inextricably linked, and the\nrights of vulnerable communities protected and enhanced. In the words\nof the resolution, it aims \u201cto achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions\nthrough a fair and just transition for all communities and workers\u201d and\n\u201cto create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity for all\n\npeople of the United States\u201d ( [2]:5).\nThe economic rationale of the GND is based on the adoption of\n\nKeynesian1 demand-side economics of the type utilized by President\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) to revitalise the US economy during\nthe Great Depression of the 1930s \u2014 a project known as the \u201cNew Deal\u201d\n\u2014 and to finance the US&#x27;s Second World War (WW2) effort [3,4].\nBroadly speaking, in this type of macroeconomic approach a govern-\nment creates as much money as it needs to, to pay for its projects, and\nwithdraws money from circulation via taxes, fees and the issuing of\nbonds in order to dampen inflation. The alternative approach, which we\ncall \u201cneoclassical\u201d in this paper, is that governments must first raise\nmoney from taxes, fees and borrowing before they can spend it on their\nprojects, i.e. that money originates outside of the government and the\ngovernment must therefore get it from elsewhere before it can spend it\n[5,6]. This difference between these two approaches is further dis-\ncussed in Section 2.\n\nThe GND is of critical importance for energy researchers, policy-\nmakers, governments and society at large.

As Sanders\u2019 plan forms the most finan-\ncially detailed account to date within the political community pro-\nmoting the GND we employ it as a case study. Its costing is discussed in\nSection 3.\n\nIn this preliminary analysis we examine two key questions raised by\nthe US GND: (a) Does it make economic sense, i.e. can it be paid for\nwithout causing massive inflation? And (b) In what ways do welfare\nand other social policies, such as the job guarantee, which form a\ncentral component of a GND, relate to tackling the climate crisis? By\naddressing these questions we aim to provide new understandings of\nthe most common concerns expressed about the GND&#x27;s expansive pro-\ngram.\n\nWe explore the first of these in Sections 2 and 3 by examining the\ntype of monetary policy inherent in the GND of both Sanders and\nOcasio-Cortez/Markey and offer a detailed account of how this stands\nup to critique. We explore the second in Section 4 by explaining a raft of\nways in which social equity and climate change mitigation appear to be\ninterlinked.\n\nThe idea of a \u201cgreen new deal3\u201d is not new. Luke [9] surveyed\nproposals of the late 20th and early 21st century that considered how\nenvironmental policy initiatives could be financed after the manner of\nFDR&#x27;s Keynesian-based funding of the New Deal of the 1930s and WW2\neffort of the 1940s. He and subsequent authors labeled these \u201cgreen\nnew deals\u201d. In Klein&#x27;s [10] words, they contrast with attempts by\ngovernments over nearly 3 decades to find climate solutions that \u201cdo\nnot clash with \u2018free market\u2019 orthodoxies of deregulation, privatization,\nlow taxes for the rich, and public austerity\u201d. Mainstream economic\nsolutions to climate change have been carbon-centric approaches: e.g.\ncarbon taxes and emissions trading schemes, or narrow regulations on\npolluters [10]. Keynesian-type green new deal proposals, on the other\nhand, aim to achieve climate change mitigation via and in parallel with\na deep transformation of the economy [11,12].\n\nA spate of such proposals emerged from academia and NGOs during\nand in the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008\u20139. A\u015f\u0131c\u0131 and B\u00fcn\u00fcl\n[13] suggested a green new deal4 as a way of revitalizing the world\neconomy through stimulus spending. Custers [14] proposed a green\nnew deal as a solution to the convergence of global environmental and\neconomic crises, drawing strong parallels with Keynes\u2019 macroeconomic\napproach [3,4] in FDR&#x27;s New Deal in the 1930s and during WW2.5 One\nof the first NGOs to publicly launch the idea was the UK Green New\nDeal Group [15]6 who in 2008 published its first \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d\n\nreport. Soon afterwards, the Green European Foundation backed by the\nEuropean Parliament&#x27;s Green Party became a major advocate for a\ngreen new deal for Europe [16]. Around the same time in the US the\nprogressive Centre for American Progress proposed a Green Recovery\nProgram to \u201cboost a struggling economy and jumpstart\u2026 long-term\ntransformation to a low-carbon economy\u201d ( [17]:1). Outside Europe\nand the US, the South Korean government announced the adoption of a\ngreen new deal in 2009. In addition to national initiatives, the United\nNations Environmental Programme (UNEP) promoted the idea of a\n\u201cglobal green new deal\u201d [18] as an urgent response both to financial\nand environmental collapse.\n\nWhile most green new deal proposals which emerged following the\n2008 financial crisis (e.g. Obama&#x27;s 2009 bill7) shared elements of a\nKeynesian interventionist economic model, many adopted an \u201cecolo-\ngical modernization\u201d approach [19,20], predominately focusing on\ninvestments in technological solutions [21] .8 Feint and Cowell [19]\nargued that a common weakness of these initiatives was their techno-\nlogical focus, such as energy efficiency increases and renewable energy\nsources, without sufficient regulation to forcibly reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nThe goals of the Ocasio-Cortez/Markey GND resolution and of the\nSanders GND, which is largely based on it, are far more radical and far-\nreaching (see Table 1). First, the Ocasio-Cortez/Markey GND resolution\ncalls for a \u201cnational, social, industrial and economic mobilization at a\nscale not seen since World War II and the New Deal era\u201d in order to\ndecarbonize the US economy by 2030 ( [2]: 5). Second, it positions\naddressing structural inequality, poverty mitigation, and neoliberal-\ndriven welfare state retrenchment at its center. The resolution sees the\nclimate crisis as interlinked with deeply entrenched racial, regional and\ngender-based inequalities in income and wealth [2], and so insists on\ntackling these with an array of programs that have hitherto been seen as\ndisconnected. By bringing economic wellbeing into the heart of a pro-\ngram to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the GND promises, \u201cto pro-\nvide all people of the United States with (i) a \u201cjob guarantee with a\nfamily sustaining wage\u201d including \u201chigh-quality union jobs\u201d that have\n\u201cadequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement\nsecurity\u201d; (ii) \u201chigh-quality health care\u201d; (iii) \u201caffordable, safe and\nadequate housing\u201d; (iv) \u201ceconomic security\u201d; and (v) \u201cclean water,\nclean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.\u201d\n\nEnergy researchers and policymakers are no strangers to the first of\nthe GND aims, since energy use is the main source of CO2 emissions.\nFor over two decades energy researchers have vigorously employed\nsociological, psychological, economic, engineering, sociotechnical, so-\ncial practice and policy science frameworks to explore how society can\nreduce GHG emissions. The second goal of the GND \u2013 eliminating\npoverty - has not been so evident in energy research or policy-making\n[22,23], despite enormous increases in economic inequality over the\nlast 3\u20134 decades [24,25,26,27,28]. We return to this theme in Section 4.\n\nThe Keynesian, demand-side economic theory on which some of\nthese proposals are based was effectively ousted from developed\ncountries\u2019 economic policies when neoliberal, supply-side economics\nbegan to dominate both policy and popular discourse from the 1980s\nonwards [6,24,27,28,29]. However, Keynesian economics underwent a\nbrief and rather narrowly restricted revival under the guise of quanti-\ntative easing in governments\u2019 attempts to reflate economies after the\nGreat Recession [30]. Some leading economists see increasing support\nfor a Keynesian approach arising as the neoclassical approach of sti-\nmulating demand by reducing interest rates becomes ineffective \u2013 since\nreal interest rates are now at or around zero in most developed\neconomies [31,32].\n\n2 A pan-European organization called DiEM25 [81]launched its own GND\npolicy proposal, which it pushed ahead of European Parliamentary elections in\nMay 2019.\n\n3 From this point on we use lower case letters for the general idea of a green\nnew deal and upper case for the Green New Deal currently before the US\nCongress.\n\n4 New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winner Thomas Friedman first used the term\n\u201cGreen New Deal\u201d in January 2007\n\n5 Unlike Keynes, however, Custers challenged the idea of economic growth,\narguing it is destructive of the environment. Taking this further, Bauhardt [91]\nproposed a green new deal as an \u201cecofeminist\u201d alternative to a growth-based,\ncapitalist economy. More generally, Mundaca and Richter [92] reviewed sti-\nmulus packages aimed at increasing the share of renewable energy, many of\nwhich covered the period of the Great Recession.\n\n6 A coalition of influential politicians, journalists, and NGO representatives\n\n7 President Obama spent an unprecedented $90 billion on clean energy and\ngreen initiatives through The American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009.\n\n8 The GND served as a central platform of the Green party US presidential\ncampaign of Jill Stein in 2012 and 2016. Stein&#x27;s 2016 platform included a job\nguarantee target of 20 million.\n\nR. Galvin and N. Healy Energy Research &amp; Social Science 67 (2020) 101529\n\n2\n\n\n\nAlong with the discussion of green new deals over the past few\ndecades there has therefore been much literature exploring updated\nversions of Keynesian demand-side economics. This is often broadly\ntermed \u201cmodern monetary theory\u201d or \u201cmodern money theory\u201d (MMT),\nthough there are fine distinctions in this tradition and some eschew the\nlabel MMT and simply call their approach Keynesian, neo-Keynesian or\npost-Keynesian, as we see by comparing Bell [33], Fullwiler et al. [34],\nJuniper et al. [35], Palley [36,37], Smithin [38], Tymoigne [39,40],\nTymoigne and Wray [43] and Wray [5,41,42]. Since the GND resolu-\ntion was published, this literature has presented debate and discussion\nof whether the US GND can be financed without unacceptably high\ninflation, as seen in Nersisyan and Wray [46], Palley [44], Sweeny [45]\nand Tymoigne [40]. Much of the debate is between modern money\ntheorists such as Nersisyan and Wray [46] and less radical Keynesian\napproaches such as Palley&#x27;s [44] \u2013 a discussion we return to below.\n\nPublic debate on the issue of financing has also ensued: For ex-\nample, see op-ed exchanges between Nobel Prize winning economist\nPaul Krugman [47] and Professor Stephanie Kelton [48] a leading MMT\nscholar, who has advised both Senator Sanders and Congresswoman\nOcasio-Cortez.\n\nThe remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we\noffer a brief description of relevant aspects of demand-side economics,\nwhich are basic to so-called Keynesian, neo-Keynesian, post-Keynesian\nand MMT economic theory, contrasting this with supply-side eco-\nnomics, which is basic to current dominant neoclassical or neoliberal\napproaches. We also offer a longer and more detailed primer on Key-\nnesian monetary approaches and MMT in the Supplementary Material.\nIn light of this discussion, in Section 3 we explore arguments as to\nwhether the GND makes economic sense, taking Sanders\u2019 fully costed\nGND as a case study. In Section 4 we explore the ways in which the\nGreen New Deal interweaves climate change mitigation and a program\nfor radically reducing economic inequality. We offer conclusions in\nSection 5.\n\n2. Demand side economics and modern monetary theory\n\nNeoclassical economics assumes or argues that money originates\nexternal to governments and therefore, in order to be able to spend\nmoney, governments first have to raise money via taxes, fees, fines or\nborrowing (which is also called issuing bonds). This is the standard\napproach of most economics textbooks, though none, to our knowledge,\nactually offers a convincing case for it, if a case at all [6,49,50]. In fact,\n\nhowever, it is easy to see that in the modern world, countries who are\nsovereign over their own currencies \u2013 such as New Zealand, Australia,\nCanada, the UK and the US \u2013 create their own money out of thin air and\ndissolve it back into nothing, to suit their needs [5,33,51]. This does not\napply to Germany, France or other Eurozone countries, which have\nsurrendered sovereignty over their currency to a pooled authority, but\nit certainly applies to the US.9 There is nothing in principle to stop the\nUS government creating as much money as it wants, denominated in US\ndollars, and injecting it into the economy by paying its workers and\ncontractors, buying things like jet fighters and school equipment and\nproviding social welfare and other benefits. All money denominated in\nthe country&#x27;s own currency is endogenous [33,38,41]. It always origi-\nnates from inside government apparatus, not from some outside source\nof wealth.\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this claim. Even avowedly\nneoclassical or neoliberal economists do not dispute that this is what\nhappens in practice. It is simply a statement of what happens in modern\neconomies. In the Supplementary Material we explain in more detail\nhow modern money works by tracing the lines of debt and credit\nthrough the banking system. We also comment there on how banks also\ncreate money out of nothing when they issue a loan, and that this is a\nless \u201cpowerful\u201d form of money than that which governments create,\nsince it is only backed by the economic health of the bank.\n\nThe US government can go on creating money out of nothing as long\nas it wants to. It can never \u201crun out of money\u201d. When President Barrack\nObama appeared to imply, on 4 December 2013, that his government\ncould not pursue certain programs because \u201cthere is no more money\u201d,\nthis was fiscally enigmatic. There is always more money if the gov-\nernment decides to create more.\n\nThere is, however, a very important catch. If a government allows\nthere to be more money circulating in the economy than the perceived\nvalue of the goods and services on offer, this will cause inflation \u2013 more\nand more money chasing the same quantity of goods and services\n[37,40,43]. The government therefore has to withdraw money from the\neconomy \u2013 not in order to raise money to finance its spending, but to\ndampen or prevent inflation. It does this by raising taxes, charging fees\n\nTable. 1\nOcasio-Cortez/Markey Green New Deal resolution summary.\n\nGoals Projects Requirements\n\nMillions of new, high-paying jobs.

Healy Energy Research &amp; Social Science 67 (2020) 101529\n\n3\n\n\n\nand fines, and issuing bonds. When it receives this money it dissolves it\nback into nothing and writes off the equivalent amount from the debit\nside of its books (or adds it to the credit side, which has the same ar-\nithmetic effect).\n\nSo the question governments have to face in financing something\nlike the GND \u2013 or schools, parks, bridge construction, the military or\nmissions to Mars \u2013 is not \u201cCan we raise enough money to pay for this?\u201d,\nbut \u201cWill it be inflationary?\u201d Will it increase the number of dollars cir-\nculating such that goods and services of limited quantity, such as brain\nsurgery, houses, petrol and legal services, will become increasingly\nexpensive as people bid against each other for these with their excess\ndollars?\n\nThis is the issue facing the GND. The intelligent critiques of it are\nnot those that simply complain it will cost too much, such as the in-\nexplicably high estimate of $93 trillion by the right-wing think tank\nAmerican Action Forum [52], or estimates by (other) Fox News sources\nthat it could cost between $6.8 trillion and $44.6 trillion [53]. Rather,\nquestions raised by critics such as Palley [36,37,44] and addressed by\nNersisyan and Wray [46], Sweeny [45], Tymoigne [39,40] and others\nare much more salient because they address its likely effect on inflation.\nThis is where focus our analysis in the next section.\n\n3. Will the Green New Deal be inflationary?\n\nThe GND resolution is in the form of an outline of intended policy\ninitiatives and does not include detailed costing. As noted above,\nhowever, Sanders\u2019 GND is costed item by item and serves as our case\nstudy.\n\nWe begin by noting that Sanders\u2019 GND costing does not include\nuniversal health care, which is one of the features of the GND resolu-\ntion. Instead, his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d is structured separately from his\nGND [54] and he maintains his restructuring of health care will actually\nsave the Federal government as much as $5.1 trillion over 10 years,\nwhich amounts to about 2.7% of GDP. Most independent estimates\nagree that Medicare for All would bring a net saving [55,56, 60], and in\nthe light of these, Nersisyan and Wray [46] suggest a conservative es-\ntimate is a saving of 3.7% of GDP, which amounts to about $0.7 trillion\nper year, or $7 trillion over 10 years. However, in our analysis below\nwe will err on the safe side by refraining from subtracting likely gains\nthrough healthcare reform from the cost of the GND. We will also\nconsider the effects of Palley&#x27;s claimed increase in health care in our\nanalysis.\n\nAside from heath care, Sanders\u2019 $16.3 trillion GND plan aims to\n\u201cpay for itself over 15 years\u201d through generating revenue (or, as\nKeynesian economists might express it, through withdrawing money\nfrom circulation) from the following sources: (a) $3.085 trillion by\neliminating all fossil fuel subsidies, increasing taxation of fossil fuel\ncompanies and increasing polluter fines and litigation; (b) $1.215 tril-\nlion from reducing military expenses related to protecting oil-shipping\nroutes; (c) $6.4 trillion from selling energy via power marketing au-\nthorities; and (d) $2.3 trillion from income taxes on the 20 million new\njobs created. Sanders also argues his GND will: (a) save $1.31 trillion by\nreducing the need for what the US currently spends on public assistance\nprograms, due to the creation of 20 million new jobs; and (b) raise a\nfurther $2 trillion by making the wealthy and large corporations pay\n\u201ctheir fair share\u201d of taxes [57] .10 $16.3 trillion spent over 15 years is\nabout 5.7% of GDP annually.\n\nWhat do critics and commentators say about figures such as these?\nOne of the GND&#x27;s most persistent critics working within a Keynesian\nframework is Thomas Palley [44], whose earlier critiques of green new\ndeals in general [36,37] were in turn critiqued by a number of econo-\nmists (e.g. Smithin [38], Timoigne and Wray [43]). Palley accepts the\n\nKeynesian tenets outlined in Section 2. Working within this framework\nhe argues that \u201csimple arithmetic\u201d proves that the amount of extra\ngovernment spending required for the GND would increase the money\nsupply so much as to require unacceptably high taxes to keep inflation\ndown. Since his is probably the most systematically thought-through\neconomic critique, we outline his numbers and the steps in his argu-\nment below. We relegate explanations of technical terms to footnotes.\n\nFirst, Palley [44] calculates an additional expenditure for Medicare\nfor All at 8.6% of GDP ($ 1.76 trillion per year), free college tuition for\nall at 1.7% of GDP ($0.35 trillion per year) and the GND itself at 2% of\nGDP ($0.41 trillion per year), less relief saving11 at 1% of GDP, a net\nincrease of 11.3% of GDP ($2.32 trillion per year). He then includes a\n\u201cKeynesian expenditure multiplier effect\u201d12 of 1.5, implying that GND\nexpenditure will result in a total increase in economic activity of $3.49\ntrillion per year (1.5 x $2.32 trillion) or 17% of GDP. We note that\nPalley&#x27;s estimate of the cost of the GND itself is lower than Sanders\u2019, at\n2% of GDP compared to 5.7%.\n\nSecond, Palley \u201cgenerously\u201d assumes the \u201cfull employment un-\nemployment rate\u201d is 2%, i.e. that \u201cfull\u201d employment would actually see\n2% of the employable workforce still unemployed, since unemployment\nhas never been below 2% in post-WW2 years. Since the official un-\nemployment rate was 3.9% (6.3 million persons) at the time of his\ncritique, he maintains that this implies there is only room for reducing\nunemployment by 1.9% (3.1 million persons). He then uses an \u201cOkun\ncoefficient\u201d13 of 0.5, to calculate that the economy has spare capacity of\ntwice this percentage, i.e. 3.8% of GDP. He takes this to mean the\neconomy could absorb an increase in economic activity of 3.8% of GDP\nwithout inflationary pressure due to job creation.\n\nThird, he points out that this 3.8% is well below the 17% increase\nthat (he calculates) would result from the GND and associated social\nwelfare programs. The difference, 13.2% of GDP, represents the excess\nof demand that cannot be absorbed by the fall in unemployment.\n\nHe therefore concludes that the government would have to increase\nthe tax take by 13.2% of GDP, or about $2.7 trillion, to mop up extra\nspending power and stave off high inflation. Current tax take is $3.48\ntrillion (equal to about 17% of GDP), so, he concludes, the total tax take\nwould have to increase by about 77%.\n\nHow sound is Palley&#x27;s critique? We will apply Palley&#x27;s approach to\nSanders\u2019 own estimates for GND funding (given in Table 2), which does\nnot include Sanders\u2019 estimated reduction in the cost of healthcare. The\ntotal cost of $16.36 trillion amounts to $1.636 trillion per year if con-\ndensed into 10 years. Sanders plans to spread the cost over 15 years,\nbringing it to $1.1 trillion per year, but we follow Palley for now and\nuse the 10-year horizon. Sanders\u2019 GND figures omit the cost of addi-\ntional new housing, of $1.48 trillion [58], or $0.148 trillion per year\nover 10 years, as he intends to finance this through a national housing\ntrust. However, we include it here so as to accord with Palley&#x27;s ap-\nproach, bringing the total annual cost to $1.784 trillion per year.\n\nFollowing Palley&#x27;s approach by using a Keynesian expenditure\nmultiplier effect of 1.5, this amounts to an increase in economic activity\nof $2.676 trillion on an annual basis. This is 13.1% of the 2018 GDP\nfigure of $20.5 trillion [59], substantially lower than Palley&#x27;s figure of\n\n10 See also commentary in https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-\nclimate_n_5d5e2104e4b0b59d256f42cc\n\n11 Relief saving is savings made when new government funded programs\nmake existing programs and expenditure no longer necessary.\n\n12 A Keynesian expenditure multiplier effect arises as follows. Suppose that\nevery extra dollar of income a person receives results in them spending an extra\n30cents. The person who receives this 30cents therefore spends an extra 9 cents,\nand so on, as a geometric progression: 1 + 0.3 + 0.09 + 0.027 + \u2026. The sum\nof the infinite series is about 1.41, i.e. if the expenditure multiplier is 0.3, each\ninjection of an extra $1 into the economy will lead to an increase in GDP of\nabout 1.41 times its directly calculated effect.\n\n13 The Okun coefficient is the percentage by which GDP (or alternatively,\nGNP) increases as unemployment falls by 1%. In the US this is generally taken\nas a 2% increase in GDP for each 1% decrease in unemployment. Note that\nPalley&#x27;s calculations are actually based on an Okun coefficient of 2.0, not 0.5.\n\nR. Galvin and N.

Using Palley&#x27;s assumptions for the minimum unemployment rate,\nthis would result in an excess stimulus of 13.1 \u22123.8 = 9.3% of GDP,\nwhich could not be absorbed by further increase in employment. Using\nPalley&#x27;s methodology on this figure the total tax take would therefore\nhave to increase by 9.3% of GDP, or $1.907 trillion, an increase of\n54.5%. This contrasts with Palley&#x27;s figure of 77% and Sanders\u2019 own\nfigure of 40%.\n\nWe note that if we were to remove health care costs from Palley&#x27;s\n\nestimate, the required tax increase in his calculation would be much\nlower than 77%. .\n\nIt is worth re-running Palley&#x27;s approach to accord with Sanders\u2019 plan\nto spread costs out over 15 years, bringing a total annual expenditure of\n$1.19 trillion per year. With a Keynesian multiplier of 1.5 this gives an\nincrease in economic activity of $1.785 trillion, or 8.7% of GDP. Again\nassuming a dampening effect of 3.8% of GDP from the jobs scheme, this\nwould require tax increases equivalent to 4.9% of GDP, or $1.00\n\nTable 2\nCost estimates of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 Green New Deal (Authors table: derived from Sanders [8].\n\nCategory Item Cost (US $BN) Type\n\nRenewable energy &amp; energy efficiency Renewable energy 1520 Internal\nEnergy storage capacity 852\nSmart grid 526\nWeatherize buildings 2180\nElectrify low-income communities 964\n\nPublic transport Increase public transit ridership 65% by 2030 300 Internal\nRegional high-speed rail 607\n\nAviation &amp; shipping Replace all shipping trucks 216 Internal\nFully decarbonize shipping / transportation 150\n\nelectric vehicles (EVs) New EV grants 2090 Internal\nVehicle trade-in program grants 681\nEV charging infrastructure 86\nSchool &amp; transit electric buses grants 407\n\nLow-carbon economy R&amp;D R&amp;D: energy storage (StorageShot initiative) 30 Internal\nR&amp;D: decrease cost of EVs 100\nR&amp;D: decarbonise shipping &amp; aviation 500\n\nInternational leadership Green Climate Fund (intl. emissions reduction) 200 Overseas\nsustainable &amp; resilient communities Climate Justice Resiliency Fund 40 Internal\n\nSea-level rise adaptation 162\nWildfire firefighting 18\nFEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program 2\nbroadband infrastructure improvement 150\n\nClean air &amp; water Repair national water systems (via WATER Act) 35 Internal\nGreen infrastructure &amp; public lands conservation 171\nFund the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund 1\nEnd National Park maintenance backlog 25\n\nRoads, bridges &amp; water infrastructural improvements Roads: national highways 75 Internal\nRoads: surface transportation needs 2\nRepair transportation networks 5\nRepair &amp; retrofit travel infrastructure 636\nResiliency of new infrastructure 300\n\nJust transition New jobs, pensions, 5-year wage guarantee etc. 1300 Internal\nMiners Black Lung Disability Fund 15\nDept. labor training for high-risk workers &lt;1\nFossil fuel well &amp; mine clean-up 100\nSuperfund sites clean-up 238\nBrownfield sites clean-up 150\n\nTargeted regional economic development Appalachian Regional Commission 3 Internal\nDelta Regional Authority 1\nDenali Commission &lt;1\nNorthern Border Regional Commission &lt;1\nSoutheast Crescent Regional Commission &lt;1\nEconomic Development Assistance Programs 2\nInfrastructure for impacted communities 130\n\nSocial safety net Expand LIHEAP 25 Internal\nUniversal school meals 216\nExpand SNAP 311\n\nSustainable agriculture &amp; farmer support Eco-regenerative agriculture 410\nPay farmers to keep carbon in soil 160\nR&amp;D: new framing techniques &amp; seeds 1\nFarmland conservation 25\nOrganic farming 1\nRural Energy For America Program 1\nDisadvantaged &amp; Beginning Farm program &lt;1\nTribal land access &amp; extension program 1\nFarmer Opportunity Training &amp; Outreach program 1\n\nConnect consumers with local farms &amp; healthy foods Victory lawns &amp; gardens initiative 36 Internal\nCo-op / community-owned grocery stores 15\nLocal food processing (inc. slaughter &amp; dairy) 31\nOn-farm processing &amp; farmers markets funds &lt;1\nFood recovery &amp; composting programs 160\nTotal costs 16,364\n\nR.

This would be\nequivalent to an increase in the total tax take of 28.6%, somewhat\nlower than Sanders\u2019 estimate of 40%.\n\nWe conclude, then, that Palley&#x27;s figure of a 77% tax increase could\nonly hold true if the GND were to be paid for within 10 years, the cost of\nMedicare for All were very large and positive rather than small or ne-\ngative, and the new housing costs were accounted for within the GND\nplan \u2013 none of which is feasible. Indeed, even including the housing\ncosts and assuming high costs for Medicare for All, the 15-year time\nframe would bring the required tax increase down to around 51%. We\nnote, however, that a new, very robust study of US healthcare con-\ncludes that Medicare for All would save the US economy $450 billion\nper year [60].\n\nSanders\u2019 proposed increase in the tax take by 40% is therefore\nreasonable, even perhaps an overestimate. It would amount to $1.4\ntrillion per year, a calculation that accords with Nersisyan and Wray&#x27;s\nestimates [46, p.40], and this would reach $1.79 trillion with a tax\nincrease of 51%. If this contingency did arise, the gap of $0.39 trillion\ncould be covered by compulsory and voluntary savings. These would\ninclude the pension schemes associated with government-created jobs\nas well as war-type bonds aimed to mature at staggered intervals after\nthe GND period, similar to how the US ran war bonds in the 1940s [61].\nHence, even using Palley&#x27;s methodology on Sanders\u2019 own figures and\nallowing for a portion of excess funds to be withdrawn from circulation\nvia government bonds, we find that Sanders\u2019 GND would require tax\nincreases only a few percent higher than Sanders himself claims.\n\nFurther, a major difficulty with Palley&#x27;s approach is his non-dy-\nnamic assumptions about the unemployment rate. He assumes that\nincreases in job opportunities do not stimulate people who are currently\nin economically non-productive roles to move into the workforce. Mroz\nand Savage [62] argue that creating more well-paid jobs actually in-\ncreases the number looking for regular work as they turn away from\nactivities like study, housekeeping or zero-hours contract work. This\nwould provide scope for yet more government expenditure and act as\ndownward pressure on inflation. There might still be 2% registered as\nunemployed, but many of these would represent new jobseekers en-\ntering the job market.\n\nThe above line of argument, then, leads to an estimate for the re-\nquired tax increase (for a GND of the form explicated in detail by\nSanders) as lying close to Sanders\u2019 figure of 40%.\n\nThe question to be faced, therefore, is whether US society would\nfind tax increases of around 40% acceptable. During WW2 total gov-\nernment expenditure \u2013 financed by taxes, fees, fines and bonds \u2013 rose to\na peak of 45% of GDP in 1943\u201344 [59]. Clearly the US public found this\nacceptable in wartime. Interestingly, it then fell rapidly as the war\ncontinued, reaching 14% of GDP in 1946 and bottoming out at 10% in\n1947. Further, inflation never went higher than 11% in the war years\nand averaged about 5% during that period [63] \u2013 despite government\nexpenditure reaching 45% of GDP.\n\nIn conclusion, Sanders\u2019 GND proposal does not seem to break any\nvital economic rules and would not necessarily lead to inflation if\nmanaged sensibly. The main unanswered question is whether US so-\nciety would accept 1940s-70s-style tax rates on its wealthiest citizens.\n\nOne approach to this question is to consider tax rates in recent US\nhistory. The graph in Fig. 1, from data gathered by Thomas Piketty and\nused in his new book, Capital et id\u00e9ologie [28] helps to address this\nquestion. It shows the proportion of different US groups\u2019 income paid as\ntax, including all taxes less social welfare transfers and food stamps \u2013\ni.e. the net proportion of persons\u2019 income paid in tax. It is here clearly\nseen that prior to about 1981, the top earners in the US paid at least\n40% more tax than today, as did the next highest band prior to about\n1957. There are therefore many years of recent historical precedent for\nincreasing tax rates for the very wealthy. Further, recent polls show\nsignificant support for a wealth tax and a 70% top income tax rate,\nacross party lines [64,65].\n\n4. Combining CO2 emission reduction with reducing inequality\n\nIn this section we ask why the GND tightly combines the task of\nreducing CO2 emissions with that of eliminating poverty and reducing\ninequality. Both the Ocasio-Cortez/Markey and Sanders\u2019 GNDs affirm\nthat the US is currently undergoing interlocking crises, most notably the\nclimate emergency and deepening extremes of economic inequality.\nConsequently there are a number of social, egalitarian and justice\nconcerns embedded in the Ocasio-Cortez/Markey GND resolution. It\ncalls for the US to reach \u201cnet-zero greenhouse gas emissions\u201d \u201cthrough a\nten-year national mobilization\u201d and embeds climate solutions within an\nanti-inequality agenda. This includes creating high-paying union jobs\nincluding a \u201cjob guarantee\u201d; addressing racial and gender inequities;\nand providing adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and\nretirement security.\n\nSimilarly, Sanders\u2019 GND proposes to create 20 million well-paid,\nunionized jobs; build 7.4 million affordable and decent low carbon\nhomes; upgrade existing dwellings\u2019 energy efficiency including 1.2\nmillion federal housing units; green the electricity grid including energy\nstorage capacity; fund climate resilience programmes for marginalized\nand indigenous communities; fund regional development in neglected\nrural areas; and invest in agriculture to support the production of more\nnutritious foods with less carbon-intensive methods [8,66,67].\n\nThese aspirations would make an interesting study for their own\nsake. However, our concern here is to ask how such goals relate spe-\ncifically to climate change mitigation. Why would a social welfare and\nfiscally redistributive approach be needed, to stave off a climate dis-\naster? We approach this question from a pragmatic, rather than nor-\nmative, point of view. Energy justice scholars will no doubt be inter-\nested in the normative links, but we leave this for others to consider.\n\nFirst, there is abundant evidence that wealthy elites are responsible\nfor a disproportionate amount of CO2 emissions. A series of studies by\nJorgenson and colleagues in high-income countries found a positive\ncorrelation between economic inequality and CO2 emissions from\nconsumption. The higher the Gini coefficient of both wealth and in-\ncome, the higher the CO2 emissions per inhabitant [68,69,70]. Mean-\nwhile, a study by Chancel and Piketty [71] reveals that the personal\nCO2 emissions of the wealthiest 1% are up to 20 times as large as the\naverage in the US. A more detailed investigation of UK CO2 emissions\nfrom consumption concludes that increasing the tax rate on the highest\nincomes by just a few percentage points and redistributing the proceeds\nto the poorest households would significantly reduce CO2 emissions\n[72]. Finally, a series of large-scale household surveys in EU countries\nreveals a U-shaped curve of CO2 emissions by household income [73].\nEmissions of poor households are often disproportionately high because\nthey cannot afford energy efficiency upgrades, while those of rich\nhouseholds are high because of excessive consumption practices. There\nis abundant evidence, then, that reducing income and wealth inequality\nin high-income countries is associated with lower CO2 emissions.\n\nSecond, an important factor is the direct industrial CO2 pollution of\nlarge, fossil fuel emitting firms. Heede [74] showed that 90 companies\nhad produced two-thirds of the planet&#x27;s cumulative global CO2 emis-\nsions up to 2010. It is not simply a case of \u201cthe bigger the firm, the\nbigger its CO2 footprint\u201d. Rather, large firms with proportionately high\nCO2 emissions often use their excess wealth to wield power in the\npolitical process to obstruct legislative and regulatory restrictions on\ntheir activities and to propagate public discourse to soften and stave off\nobjections [24,75]. Reich [50] gives a systematic account of the lob-\nbying activities of such firms in the US. He documents the enormous\namounts of money they allocate to lobbying and the specific laws and\nregulations they influence in their favor. Winters [76,77] has shown a\nsimilar pattern by wealthy elites on a more global scale. The GND\nwould go a long way to breaking up this nexus of power in the US,\nmaking it easier for the government, rather than wealthy elites, to set\nthe agenda for activities implicated in CO2 emissions.\n\nThird, many of the technical developments arising from climate\n\nR. Galvin and N. Healy Energy Research &amp; Social Science 67 (2020) 101529\n\n6\n\n\n\nchange mitigation would directly benefit people of low income. The\ndetails of what a \u201cnet-zero greenhouse emissions\u201d country would entail\nare spelled out item by item in the GND, including: 100% renewable\nelectricity; making all buildings thermally efficient; making agriculture\nand food production more climate-friendly; restoring fragile and da-\nmaged ecosystems; making industry radically less polluting; and\nbuilding resilience against natural disasters, including climate damage.\nWith regard to (energy efficient) housing, for example, building new\nlow-carbon housing can act as a decarbonizing lever for the building\nsector, which contributes approximately 40% of US energy consump-\ntion [78].\n\nFourth, as leading energy economist Reinhard Madlener argues\n[79], there is a risk that a low-carbon energy transition could impact\nnegatively on low-income and vulnerable groups and cause a political\nbacklash, which could slow down mitigation efforts. Unless strong po-\nlicies are advanced to support a just transition, fossil fuel dependent\nand low-income communities will suffer as we decarbonize [80]. San-\nders\u2019 GND prioritizes a just transition to \u201cto ensure no one is left be-\nhind\u201d [8], providing social safety nets for those who bear the social\ncosts of climate policies.14 Similarly, carbon-centric approaches can\ndisproportionally impact lower-income families who spend a larger\nshare of their incomes on fuel or public transportation and thereby\ngenerate backlash. The Yellow Vests protests in France [81], the 2019\nmass public revolt in Chile [82] and uprisings in Ecuador and Haiti\nwere sparked by fuel taxes, rise in public transport costs, and cuts to\nfuel subsidies. Therefore, quite apart from normative issues of energy\ninjustice [79], there are sensible pragmatic reasons to ensure that\ndecarbonization does not impact negatively on the poor.\n\nFifth, and again from a pragmatic perspective, a green jobs program\ncould break the jobs vs. environment debate that has hindered the ac-\nceptance of climate policies for decades [83]. A GND thus has the\n\npotential to create new political coalitions in favor of ambitious climate\nreforms. For example, Berguist et al&#x27;s [84] study of 2476 US residents\nfound that climate \u2018policy bundles\u2019 that include social and economic\nreforms such as affordable housing, a $15 minimum wage, or a job\nguarantee increase US public support for climate mitigation, particu-\nlarly among people of color.\n\nA sixth connecting issue is gender. Changes to the social welfare\nbenefit system in the US and severe cutbacks in the public sector\nworkforce have disproportionately affected women, particularly\nwomen of color [85]. The US clean energy economy is older, dominated\nby male workers, and lacks racial diversity when compared to all oc-\ncupations nationally ( [86]:5). Additionally, it is mostly men who work\novertime and women who work part-time. Both the Ocasio-Cortez/\nMarkey and Sanders GNDs have called for the financial and social in-\nsecurity of these groups to be addressed.15 Again (apart from normative\nissues), this would have the pragmatic effect of keeping the support of\ngender equality and related movements for serious efforts at climate\nchange mitigation.\n\nThese factors indicate that there are clear synergies between the\ngoals of reducing CO2 emissions substantially and quickly and tackling\nincome and wealth inequality. This is not just a coincidence of a social\nwelfare focused, fiscally active agenda and green politics. Wealth in-\nequality and persistent increases in CO2 emissions are inextricably in-\nterwoven in today&#x27;s social and economic context. In particular, the\npower of actors who are currently free to cause excessive CO2 emissions\nneeds to be curbed, while the support of currently vulnerable and\nmarginalized groups needs to be won and retained so that the political\nmomentum of mitigation is enhanced.\n\n5. Conclusions and research implications\n\nThe purpose of this paper has been to explore implications of the US\n\nFig. 1.

The Ocasio-Cortez/Markey\nGND resolution marks a historic shift, as it is the first far-reaching green\nnew deal policy proposal that has a good chance of being adopted by a\nmajor economy. Senator Sanders\u2019 version of the GND is largely based on\nthe Ocasio-Cortez/Markey GND but fleshes it out with carefully costed\ndetails, targets fossil fuels directly through bans on fossil fuel produc-\ntion, and contests the role of private interests in the US energy system\nmore broadly.\n\nWe argued that two things are particularly striking about the GND:\nits assumptions regarding the nature of money and its tight interlinkage\nof climate change mitigation with radical reduction of inequality. We\nexplained the GND&#x27;s Keynesian understanding of money and of gov-\nernment financing of projects, bringing this up to date with recent\ndevelopments in modern monetary theory. We examined recent critique\nof the economics of the GND and found that Sanders\u2019 GND could be\nfinanced without causing excess inflation, provided US society is willing\nto accept tax increases for its wealthiest citizens reminiscent of those of\nthe mid-to-late 20th century.\n\nWe also examined the assumption behind the GND that effective\nclimate change mitigation must go hand in hand with progressive social\nand economic policies to sharply reduce economic inequality. We ar-\ngued that current US economy, taxation, utilities ownership structure,\ncorporate lobbying power and extreme free-market orientation make it\nimpossible for the government to act decisively and effectively in cli-\nmate change mitigation. We also argued that pursuing climate change\nmitigation in ways that benefit poorer and marginalized sections of US\nsociety will bring increased public and political support for these mi-\ntigation endeavors.\n\nWe suggest these discussions bring two major challenges to social\nscience-based energy research and the sociology that lies behind it.\nFirst, this research needs to advance into serious discussion and re-\nsearch on the nature of money and how it is intrinsic and endogenous to\nhuman society and not just an exogenous commodity which humans\nmake use of. With this renewed approach, social scientists need to\nchallenge neoclassical economists to look critically at their assumptions\nabout money, which just happen to suit a neoliberal culture that is\ngaining more and more power through syphoning off larger and larger\nproportions of national wealth to itself and in the process making cli-\nmate change mitigation increasingly difficult.\n\nSecondly, social science-based energy research needs to urgently\ndevelop a research agenda on the linkages between economic inequality\nand excess CO2 emissions. To do this we have to reach into the mac-\nroeconomic domain, as it is here that \u201claws are made, tax rates are\ndecided, and social welfare programs are adopted and administered\u201d\n[87] and the causes of CO2 emissions can decisively be addressed.\n\nThe growing field of energy justice literature should be well-placed\nto explore the climate emergency in relation to inequality and to some\nextent it does this (see reviews in [88]). In particular, so-called \u201cre-\ncognition\u201d justice research documents the negative impacts on in-\ndigenous and other marginalized communities by powerful, wealthy\nfossil fuel firms and other energy concerns (e.g. [89]), and one recent\nstudy puts civil rights center-stage in addressing energy aspects of the\nclimate emergency [90]. Further, a recent, exploratory study by\nMadlener [79] lays out the economic challenges for achieving a fair,\njust transition to carbon-neutrality without this being at the expense of\nthe poor.\n\nMore generally, social science-based energy scholars have re-\nsearched around the edges of some of the determinants of CO2 emis-\nsions for decades. Now we need to go right to the heart of what drives\nclimate destruction. In particular, we need to identify the structures,\nactions and persons that enable specific, powerful individuals and\ncorporations to set the agenda for fossil fuel extraction and the culture\nof over-consumption. A critical discussion of the US Green New Deal,\nand of other Green New Deals being proposed around the world, could\nprovide social science based energy and climate research a new\n\nopportunity to do this.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nNo funding sources were used in the research or writing of this\narticle.\n\nThe article is the authors\u2019 own original work and has not been\nsubmitted elsewhere.\n\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\nSupplementary materials\n\nSupplementary material associated with this article can be found, in\nthe online version, at doi:10.1016/j.erss.2020.101529.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), Global Warming of 1.5 \u00b0C: an\nIPCC Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5 \u00b0C Above Pre-\nIndustrial Levels and Related Global Greenhouse Gas Emission Pathways, IPCC,\n2018 Retrieved from https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/.\n\n[2] GND (Green New Deal) (2018) H.Res.109 - recognizing the duty of the Federal\nGovernment to create a Green New Deal.\n\n[3] J.M.
