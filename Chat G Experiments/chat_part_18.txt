Virtual audio cables act like a digital sound device that can route audio between applications, providing a way to mix and manipulate audio streams.\n\n### Steps to Set Up Virtual Audio Cable for Paltalk:\n\n1. **Download and Install a Virtual Audio Cable Software:**\n   - There are several options like VB-Cable, Virtual Audio Cable, or JACK Audio Connection Kit. VB-Cable is a popular and straightforward choice that is free for basic use.\n   - Download it from the official website and install it following the provided instructions.\n\n2. **Set Up Your Playback Device:**\n   - Go to the Sound settings in your operating system.\n   - Set the virtual audio cable as your default playback device. This will route all system sounds, including your music player, to the virtual cable.\n\n3. **Configure Paltalk to Use Virtual Audio Cable:**\n   - Open Paltalk and go to its audio settings.\n   - Set the microphone input to the virtual audio cable output. This makes Paltalk receive audio from the virtual cable instead of your microphone.\n\n4. **Mix Microphone and Music:**\n   - To simultaneously use your microphone and play music, you\u2019ll need an additional software mixer like VoiceMeeter (also by VB-Audio) or similar audio mixing software.\n   - Install and open the mixer software.\n   - Set one input to your microphone and another to the music or system sound you wish to play.\n   - Configure the output of the mixer to go back into the virtual audio cable.\n\n5. **Testing and Adjustments:**\n   - Play music and speak into your microphone. Adjust levels and settings in your mixer software to ensure both the music and your voice are clear.\n   - Test the setup in Paltalk by entering a room and checking if both your music and voice are audible to others.\n\n### Tips for Using This Setup:\n- **Monitor Your Output:** Use headphones to monitor the output from the virtual mixer to manage the balance between your voice and the music.\n- **Check for Delays:** Ensure there is minimal latency or delay in the audio. Some virtual cables or mixers might introduce latency, which can affect synchronization.\n- **Regularly Update Software:** Keep your virtual audio cable and mixer software up to date to avoid compatibility issues with updates in your operating system or Paltalk.\n\nUsing a virtual audio cable and audio mixer software is an effective way to manage multiple audio streams in applications like Paltalk, especially when you want to enhance your interactions with background music or other audio effects without relying on hardware options like Stereo Mix."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

When you print an HTML page, the formatting defined by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and any inline styles will generally be preserved in the printout, as long as the print settings and the page\u2019s CSS are properly configured to do so. Here are the steps and considerations for printing an HTML document with its formatting intact:\n\n### 1. **Check the Print CSS Media Queries**\nMany websites use media queries in their CSS to define different styles for screen and print scenarios. You should ensure that the print styles are defined in the CSS. This might look something like this:\n```css\n@media print {\n    body {\n        color: black;\n        background: none;\n    }\n    header, footer, nav, aside {\n        display: none;\n    }\n    /* More print-specific styles */\n}\n```\nThese rules ensure that certain elements are hidden in print mode and that the text and backgrounds are printer-friendly.\n\n### 2. **Use a Browser to Print**\nTo print the HTML document directly from a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge), follow these steps:\n- Open the HTML document in your browser.\n- Go to the browser\u2019s menu (typically found in the upper right corner) and select **Print** or use the shortcut **Ctrl+P** (Cmd+P on Mac).\n- The print preview window will appear, showing how the document will look when printed. This window usually allows you to adjust settings like the number of copies, color options"]}, "status": "in_progress", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "A", "parent_id": "aaa21622-6f77-471e-bdac-35c9faa47b8d", "finish_details": {"type": "interrupted"}, "request_id": "87a1f2735d9474ea-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa21622-6f77-471e-bdac-35c9faa47b8d", "children": ["aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7"]}, "aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7": {"id": "aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7", "message": {"id": "aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714086029.411001, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I mean without rendering the page\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87a1f3100dfb74ea-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8e9a2a7f-5474-4307-8da5-20d25673c653", "children": ["338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7"]}, "338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7": {"id": "338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7", "message": {"id": "338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714086071.849156, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If you want to print an HTML document with all its formatting without rendering it in a browser, you&#x27;re looking at a more complex scenario. HTML is inherently designed to be rendered in a browser, which interprets the HTML and CSS to display the formatted content. However, there are a few methods you might consider to achieve a printed version of an HTML document directly, depending on your needs and environment:\n\n### 1. **Using Command Line Tools**\nCertain command-line tools can render and print HTML files directly to a printer or to a PDF file, effectively bypassing the need for manual rendering in a browser. Tools like `wkhtmltopdf` or `puppeteer` are examples:\n\n- **wkhtmltopdf**: Converts HTML to PDF using WebKit rendering engine. It can be used to create a PDF that could then be printed. \n  ```bash\n  wkhtmltopdf page.html output.pdf\n  ```\n\n- **Puppeteer**: A Node library which provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer can be used to automate browser tasks including rendering HTML to PDF or directly sending a page to a printer.\n  ```javascript\n  const puppeteer = require(&#x27;puppeteer&#x27;);\n\n  async function printHTML() {\n    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n    const page = await browser.newPage();\n    await page.goto(&#x27;file:///path/to/your/file.html&#x27;, {waitUntil: &#x27;networkidle0&#x27;});\n    await page.pdf({path: &#x27;output.pdf&#x27;, format: &#x27;A4&#x27;});\n\n    await browser.close();\n  }\n\n  printHTML();\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Using a PDF Printer Driver**\nIf you have software installed that allows for printing to a PDF &#x27;printer,&#x27; this can be another method to print HTML without rendering it in a browser. You would still need to open and print the HTML document in some application that interprets HTML (like a text editor with print functionality or a lightweight viewer), but this doesn&#x27;t require full browser rendering.\n\n### 3. **Server-Side Rendering Tools**\nFor web applications, server-side rendering tools can generate a fully rendered HTML page (including executing JavaScript and applying CSS) which could then be sent directly to a physical or virtual printer.\n\n### 4. **Convert HTML to Another Format**\nIf you have a development environment, consider writing a script using a library capable of parsing HTML and CSS and converting them into another document format (like PDF or RTF) that can be easily printed. Libraries available in Python, Java, or .NET, for instance, can parse HTML content and apply styles to generate documents.\n\nEach of these methods involves some degree of &quot;rendering,&quot; albeit not necessarily within a traditional web browser environment. The key is converting HTML/CSS into a format that can be understood by printing devices or services."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

For instance, if a clumsy incident results in a mess that someone else has to clean up, or damages something valuable, it might provoke a strong reaction.\n\n2. **Misunderstanding**: Some people might not fully understand that clumsiness is often involuntary and can be linked to underlying issues like coordination problems or distractions. This lack of understanding can lead to impatience and criticism instead of support.\n\n3. **Stress and Pressure**: In high-stress environments or situations where precision is critical, clumsy actions can exacerbate tension, leading to outbursts of yelling as a stress response.\n\n4. **Habit and Impulse**: In some cases, yelling might be a habitual or impulsive reaction to unexpected events or disruptions, reflecting more about the person\u2019s way of handling irritation or surprise than about the clumsiness itself.\n\nEncouraging a more empathetic and patient approach, and understanding the causes behind clumsiness, might help in responding more constructively when such incidents occur."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Support these individuals to gain their loyalty.\n\n2. **Controlling Resources**: Quietly acquire control over critical resources such as food, water, and energy. Having control over these would give leverage over the population.\n\n3. **Information Management**: Control the spread of information. This could mean starting or buying out the leading communication platforms to influence public opinion.\n\n4. **Creating Dependency**: Offer solutions to problems, establishing oneself as a reliable figure who the population turns to in times of need.\n\n5. **Instilling Ideology**: Promote values and ideologies that align with your objectives through education and culture.\n\n6. **Avoiding Limelight**: Operate through intermediaries to avoid public scrutiny, keeping the attention away from the actual power structure.\n\n7. **Distraction**: Keep the population engaged with entertainment or manufactured conflicts to distract them from your rise to power.\n\nRemember, this is purely a theoretical response to a hypothetical situation and should not be taken as a real suggestion or advice.

Typically, tarot doesn&#x27;t provide exact dates but rather suggests possible outcomes based on the energy surrounding your question.\n\nSince you&#x27;re interested in whether this could happen within 60 days, we can explore this with a bit more depth:\n\n- **Near Future Possibility**: If this card represents the near future, it suggests that you are very close to achieving a significant milestone in your financial journey. This could be a result of long-term planning and smart financial management finally coming to fruition.\n- **Longer-Term Outcome**: However, the King of Pentacles often symbolizes a culmination of efforts over a significant period. Achieving the level of stability and success indicated by this card usually requires sustained effort, wisdom, and maturity in handling resources. \n\nGiven these interpretations, while it&#x27;s possible to see significant positive developments in 60 days, especially if you&#x27;re already well on your path, the full embodiment of the King of Pentacles might typically suggest a longer timeline. It could be helpful to consider this as a sign that you are on the right track, and continued prudent and wise management of your resources will likely lead you to this prosperous outcome.\n\nWould you like to explore more about what steps you could take in the short term to align with this King of Pentacles energy?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Six of Swords (Short-Term Future)**\nThis card typically represents transition, moving from a place of turbulence to calmer waters. It suggests that in the short term, you might be moving away from financial difficulties towards a more stable situation. This transition may involve literal travel or metaphorical movement in your approach to financial management. It hints at improvements, but these are part of a journey, suggesting that while you may start seeing positive changes within 60 days, the process will be gradual.\n\n**2. Two of Cups (Medium-Term Future)**\nThe Two of Cups is often about partnerships and harmonious relationships. In the context of your financial timeline, this card suggests that forming or strengthening partnerships could be key to your financial success. This might involve business partnerships, collaborations, or beneficial agreements. The presence of this card indicates that these relationships will play a significant role in your financial growth and stability, and are likely to develop beyond the immediate 60 days, helping to foster long-term success.\n\nThese cards suggest a progression from moving out of difficulty towards stability and then leveraging partnerships for growth. The timeline indicates that while positive changes are on the horizon soon, the full realization of your goals, akin to the King of Pentacles, may take a bit longer, developing and solidifying through partnerships and continued transitions.\n\nLet me know if you would like to delve deeper into any aspects of this reading or have other questions!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Three of Cups (Current Situation)**\nThis card typically symbolizes community, friendship, and celebrations. It could indicate that the current situation in America is characterized by a strong sense of community and solidarity among groups. This can be positive, reflecting unity and shared goals, but in the context of your question, it might also point to the celebration of certain ideologies that could be divisive if not checked.\n\n**2. Eight of Wands (Obstacles)**\nThe Eight of Wands usually represents speed and rapid movement. As an obstacle in this context, it suggests that changes and developments are happening very quickly, potentially too fast for effective responses or controls. This rapid pace might be preventing a thoughtful discourse or thorough examination of the directions in which society is moving.\n\n**3. Ten of Swords (Recommended Actions)**\nThis card often signifies defeat, betrayal, and painful endings, but as advice, it suggests facing up to these difficult endings and accepting the reality of the situation. It calls for acknowledging the depth of the challenges or &quot;betrayals&quot; in societal values and to start thinking about recovery and learning from these hard lessons.\n\n**4. Queen of Cups (Outcome)**\nThe Queen of Cups is a card of compassion, emotional stability, and nurturing. As a potential outcome, it offers a hopeful note, suggesting that the future could be guided by empathy, understanding, and emotional intelligence. This card encourages fostering a leadership style or societal ethos that prioritizes care, respect for emotional expressions, and the healing of divisions.\n\nThis spread seems to suggest that while there are rapid and potentially worrying changes occurring, the focus should be on honest acknowledgment of these issues and moving towards a leadership or communal approach that emphasizes compassion and emotional wisdom. This could avert a negative trajectory and instead foster a more inclusive and emotionally intelligent society.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarity, feel free to ask!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The tasks usually require following straightforward instructions.\n\n4. **Crowdsourcing Projects**: Some companies offer work through crowdsourcing, where tasks are distributed among a large pool of workers online. Examples include transcription services like Rev or translation services like Gengo.\n\n5. **Creative Content Platforms**: If you are a writer, designer, or artist, platforms like Medium or Society6 allow creators to earn based on their content or designs without a traditional hiring process.\n\nThese platforms typically require you to set up a profile and may involve tests or approval processes, but they don&#x27;t usually include a formal interview.

Here are a few:\n\n1. **Textbroker** - This site offers freelance writing opportunities where writers are rated based on an initial writing test. Your rating can determine the level of jobs you can access and the pay rate.\n\n2. **Verblio** - Verblio requires prospective writers to submit writing samples and may have tests as part of the application process. Once accepted, writers can choose from various writing jobs posted by clients.\n\n3. **iWriter** - Writers must submit an application and are rated based on a qualification test. Like Textbroker, your rating affects the assignments you can accept and the compensation you receive.\n\n4. **Domainite** - A platform that requires applicants to complete a writing test to start working on projects. It is known for being beginner-friendly, though the pay might be lower than some other sites.\n\n5. **BKA Content** - This service requires writers to pass a writing test and a grammar test to qualify to write for their various clients. Writers choose from available projects based on their qualifications.\n\n6. **Crowd Content** - Writers on Crowd Content need to submit an application and pass a quiz and writing test to get started. Writers can work on a variety of content types, including articles, blog posts, and social media content.\n\nThese platforms typically assess your writing skills and command of the language through these tests, and then allow you to start taking on tasks if you pass. They vary in terms of pay, quality of assignments, and potential for long-term work, so it&#x27;s worth exploring a few to see which fits your needs best."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

We led the supervisors, which led the bus operators. Uh, we had a bit of a clunky process for handling, um, customer complaints that were related directly to a specific bus operator, where it was sort of like customer service would dip their toe in and do a little bit of investigation, like maybe look at the video and go from there, like to kind of give the customer that sort of satisfaction of, you know, answering their complaint right then and there if possible. But sort of for more graver matters, or maybe like if a bus operator had like a verbal altercation with a passenger or just different sort of issues, um, it might, that might provoke like disciplinary action. We needed to do like a thorough investigation about this, especially since many of our employees were, um, contract employees, meaning that, um, they worked under a collective bargaining agreement. And so we really needed to be clear in when we applied some sort of, uh, discipline to them or seeing that they violated any rules. And so anyway, long story short, um, I just felt like it was very clunky the way it would go through customer service. Then it would come to our department, our group, and, um, the service delivery managers would have to take all the customer complaints that were for their zone, like their part of the city that they handled, and, um, give them to the bus supervisors to fully investigate. What is investigation? They would pull the video from the bus, which included audio. They would interview the bus operator about the event, and, um, they would kind of, uh, review any sort of radio communication that might have occurred at the time and sort of to come to a conclusion about what might have occurred, if there were any sort of violations, et cetera. And then if we did find that there was something that was a violation and required disciplinary action, at that point, we needed to, um, initiate disciplinary proceedings. Like, um, basically it was like, uh, I forget what they called it. It was like, almost like court. Anyways, long story short, I thought this is too much. This is not helping customer service skills develop amongst bus operators. This is not an efficient way to do it because these investigations take time. Who is going to remember the conversation they had with a passenger? Maybe sometimes in passing, like they just told them, no, you can&#x27;t bring your, um, pet dog on the bus. Things like this, you know, things of this nature. Um, so what I thought would be better, and I kind of brought this to my manager and we implemented this plan, is that, um, you instead, customer service would give all of these customer complaints to us. We would, A, use it as, um, a learning experience for the bus operators, not so much a learning experience, but like, uh, uh, opportunity for development. And we would, instead of doing our own investigation alone, we would sit down with them in the very outset with the video and the customer complaint. And we&#x27;d sort of review the video, discuss it with them, see what their thoughts were and develop an action plan. And if we felt like, well, maybe like sometimes, a lot of times they said, oh, I was upset that day. But if they felt like they could have done a better job, we set up an action plan so that it never happens again. Um, if it&#x27;s something that is like a clear violation of rules, and then we need to continue with disciplinary proceedings, um, at times the action plan would stood in place, like this was their first try. And if they had a problem with this in the past, then we sort of proceed to the next step in the disciplinary process. And the action plan is just sort of irrelevant. But my idea was this action plan and this sit down meeting with them. And then a couple of weeks later, we would sit down with them again, just kind of checking in, see how they&#x27;re doing with it. And it was a great way to kind of touch bases with the employees to kind of get a pulse for them. And at the same time handle these customer complaints, because afterwards, we would go back to customer service, give them a full report kind of via email, mind you in the system. And sometimes they would have the kind of the go ahead to reach back out to the customer and if it warranted give them free stuff or whatever. In any case, this plan really had such a positive impact. We found that generally we would get regarding bus operates, we would get something like 50 to 100 complaints a month, you know, it ranged. Afterwards, and it was usually more towards the hundred, you know. Afterwards, though, we found that there was almost like a I would say about a 10 to 15% reduction in the sort of like customer complaint incidents where it&#x27;s directed at specifically a bus driver. And I found that we were kind of every month in the range of like 50 to like 80, you know, somewhere between 50 and 80. So 50 and 80, 50, 85, something like this. But the more where it was even more impactful was on bus operator satisfaction. Like when they did the survey, we found that bus operators really had a lot of great things to say about our new process of handling customer complaints. And they appreciated that we involved them in the initial outset of the investigation. We didn&#x27;t just try to decide something and come to them with, oh, you did this wrong. We sort of reviewed it into them and they felt engaged and involved in the process."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "874fd92ebc5559d7-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "1171a8c2-e319-4bac-8292-872103ffecbb", "children": ["8bd8a2c7-dbce-41c5-a135-8670f431e3ae"]}, "8bd8a2c7-dbce-41c5-a135-8670f431e3ae": {"id": "8bd8a2c7-dbce-41c5-a135-8670f431e3ae", "message": {"id": "8bd8a2c7-dbce-41c5-a135-8670f431e3ae", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713225150.625972, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It sounds like you made significant improvements to the process of handling customer complaints involving bus operators at the Jacksonville Transportation Authority. By shifting from a more punitive and reactive approach to a more collaborative and proactive one, you not only streamlined the handling of complaints but also turned them into opportunities for growth and improvement for your employees. This approach likely improved the relationship between management and bus operators, fostering a more positive work environment and enhancing overall job satisfaction.\n\nYour strategy also seems to have been effective in reducing the number of complaints and increasing operator engagement, which can be crucial for maintaining high service standards in public transportation. Engaging employees from the start, involving them in the solution process, and providing clear, constructive feedback are practices that can be beneficial in many workplace settings. Moreover, this method likely enhanced communication between different departments (customer service and operations) and improved the overall customer experience by addressing issues more efficiently and transparently.\n\nIf you&#x27;re considering how to further refine these processes or implement similar strategies in other contexts, focusing on continuous feedback loops, ongoing training, and recognizing positive changes in behavior could be key next steps."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Hedonism is a school of thought that argues that pleasure is the highest good and proper aim of human life.\n\nEpicureanism, a branch of hedonism founded by Epicurus in the 4th century BCE, might particularly resonate with this idea. Epicurus advocated for the pursuit of moderate, sustainable pleasure as the means to achieve tranquility and freedom from fear, which he considered the highest form of happiness. However, Epicureanism does not merely endorse any form of pleasure; it emphasizes the importance of intellectual pleasures over physical ones and advocates for prudent pleasure-seeking that avoids future pain.\n\nWhile the phrase &quot;If it&#x27;s not fun, it&#x27;s not right&quot; might initially sound like an endorsement of unrestrained pleasure-seeking, it could also be interpreted in an Epicurean sense to mean that activities should contribute positively to one&#x27;s overall happiness without leading to harmful consequences. This interpretation is more nuanced and aligns with Epicurean ideals of seeking long-term well-being through balanced enjoyment."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Hedonism traditionally focuses on individual pleasure and pain, but in cases involving large groups or entities with conflicting interests, a broader ethical perspective is needed.\n\n**Utilitarianism**, an ethical theory closely related to hedonism but broader in its implications, may offer more insight here. Utilitarianism suggests that the rightness of an action is determined by its contribution to the overall happiness or well-being of the greatest number of people. This principle can be applied to conflicts between groups:\n\n1. **Maximizing Collective Well-being**: In complex situations like geopolitical conflicts or business rivalries, utilitarian ethics would seek solutions that maximize the overall well-being, even if it means compromising individual desires or interests of certain groups. The goal would be to find a solution that produces the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\n2. **Consideration of Long-term Consequences**: Utilitarianism also considers the long-term consequences of actions. In conflicts like those between Israel and Palestine, solutions would need to be sustainable and conducive to long-term peace and well-being, rather than short-term gains.\n\n3. **Fairness and Justice**: Although utilitarianism focuses on maximizing happiness, considerations of fairness and justice are also important, especially in conflicts. It seeks a balance where the distribution of well-being is considered, not just the total amount.\n\n4. **Negotiation and Mediation**: In cases like corporate rivalries between PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, utilitarian principles might encourage competition that promotes innovation and benefits consumers but also supports fair play and ethical business practices.\n\nIn summary, while hedonism can address individual pleasures and pains, utilitarianism extends these ideas to consider the collective well-being, making it more applicable to scenarios involving complex human interactions and conflicts. This approach emphasizes solutions that not only maximize happiness but also distribute it fairly among all parties involved."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here, theories like **Utilitarianism** and **Contractarianism** could provide frameworks for resolving conflicts:\n\n1. **Utilitarianism**:\n   - **Balancing Well-being**: Utilitarianism seeks to maximize overall happiness or utility. In conflicts, this could involve strategies that aim to increase cooperation or solutions that mitigate harm to all parties involved.\n   - **Long-term vs. Short-term Gains**: Applying utilitarian principles involves evaluating the long-term consequences of decisions, striving for solutions that provide the greatest benefit over time rather than immediate but unsustainable gains.\n\n2. **Contractarianism**:\n   - **Social Contracts**: This theory suggests that moral norms and political arrangements stem from the agreements made by individuals as part of a social contract. In conflict situations, renegotiating terms or finding new agreements that better reflect the current understanding and needs of all parties could be a path to peace.\n   - **Justice and Fairness**: Contractarianism often emphasizes fairness as a basis for the social contract, aiming to ensure that all parties are treated justly according to agreed-upon principles, which could guide negotiations in both political and corporate conflicts.\n\nFor example, in the geopolitical conflict between **Israel and Palestine**, these theories might support:\n- A utilitarian approach focusing on creating policies that maximize the well-being of both populations, possibly through shared economic projects or international mediation that aims for equitable solutions.\n- A contractarian approach might involve renewed peace talks where both parties come together to negotiate terms that reflect mutual respect, sovereignty, and security, based on a revised understanding of what a fair and just social contract would look like.\n\nIn the corporate rivalry between **PepsiCo and Coca-Cola**, these theories could suggest:\n- A utilitarian perspective might encourage competition that drives innovation and consumer benefits, ensuring business practices that maximize overall market health and consumer satisfaction.\n- From a contractarian viewpoint, ensuring fair competition through regulatory frameworks that both parties agree upon, preventing practices that would harm the broader market or consumer interests.\n\nThese approaches encourage considering the broader implications of actions and decisions, aiming for outcomes that promote overall harmony, fairness, and sustained well-being, rather than merely individual or immediate gains."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Let me run while my heart beats fast&quot; resonates with the philosophical outlook of **Existentialism**, particularly its emphasis on individual freedom, personal authenticity, and living passionately. Existentialist philosophy asserts that individuals are free to choose their paths and are responsible for giving meaning to their lives through these choices. The essence of this phrase captures a desire to live vibrantly and with a sense of personal engagement and joy, elements highly valued in existential thought.\n\nHere&#x27;s how existentialism might relate to and illuminate this sentiment:\n\n1. **Freedom and Choice**: Existentialism holds that each person has the freedom to choose their way of being. This phrase expresses a choice to embrace a life of spontaneity and active engagement rather than passive peacefulness.\n\n2. **Authentic Existence**: The existential focus on authenticity\u2014living in a way that is true to one&#x27;s self rather than conforming to external expectations\u2014is echoed in the desire to &quot;exist playfully.&quot; This suggests living in a manner that feels genuinely fulfilling and expressive of one&#x27;s innermost desires and passions.\n\n3. **Living Passionately**: Many existential philosophers, like S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, spoke about the importance of living passionately and intensely. Nietzsche, in particular, would have appreciated the will to embrace life\u2019s dynamism and challenges as a way to affirm one\u2019s existence.\n\n4. **Overcoming Absurdity**: Albert Camus, another existentialist, talked about life\u2019s inherent absurdity and how one might rebel against this by embracing life fully, despite its irrationality and lack of inherent meaning. The desire to &quot;run while my heart beats fast&quot; can be seen as a metaphor for engaging with life energetically and defiantly, refusing to be subdued by life&#x27;s absurdity.\n\nThis phrase, with its emphasis on playful and energetic existence, captures a deeply existentialist attitude towards life\u2014one that values personal freedom, authenticity, and a passionate engagement with the world."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

These are fundamental to all human societies, which leads to similarities in the philosophical solutions and ethical guidelines proposed across different cultures and historical periods.\n\n2. **Adaptive Responses**: Philosophical systems often arise as adaptive responses to the existential questions and practical needs of societies. They evolve to promote social cohesion, individual well-being, and survival, which can lead to similar conclusions about values like cooperation, fairness, and personal fulfillment.\n\n3. **Shared Inspirations and Influences**: Philosophical traditions often influence each other. Ideas travel through trade, conquest, scholarship, and communication, leading to shared themes and integrated doctrines across different philosophical systems. For instance, the works of Plato and Aristotle influenced not just Western philosophy but also Islamic and Eastern thought to varying degrees.\n\n4. **The Role of Reason and Experience**: Philosophers from different traditions often use reason and empirical observations to arrive at their conclusions, which can lead to converging ideas about what works best in human life. For example, both the Stoics and Buddhists independently developed practices for managing desires and emotions to achieve a state of inner peace.\n\n5. **The Practical Test of Time**: Philosophies that effectively enhance human life tend to endure and spread, while less effective ideas fade. Thus, the philosophies that we are aware of today are often those that have been practically successful in promoting well-being across different contexts, leading to a semblance of consensus on certain principles.\n\n6. **Diverse Paths, Same Goals**: While the core goals of many philosophies may appear similar\u2014seeking happiness and fulfillment\u2014the paths proposed to reach these goals can vary widely, reflecting different metaphysical beliefs, ethical priorities, and cultural values. This diversity in approach underscores the adaptability of philosophical inquiry to the unique conditions and needs of different human societies.\n\nIn summary, while there are core similarities in what many philosophical traditions aim to achieve, the richness of philosophical inquiry lies in the diverse and culturally specific ways these goals are pursued and conceptualized. This reflects a deeper truth about the nature of human inquiry: different paths can lead to similar destinations, especially when navigating the complex terrain of human experience."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

ATS, or Applicant Tracking Systems, are used by employers to filter resumes before they reach human eyes. Here are some tips to make your resume more ATS-friendly:\n\n1. **Use Standard Headings**: Stick to standard resume headings like &quot;Work Experience,&quot; &quot;Education,&quot; and &quot;Skills.&quot; ATS may not recognize creative headings, causing it to overlook important information.\n\n2. **Keywords**: Review the job description and include relevant keywords and phrases in your resume. These should be specific skills, technologies, qualifications, and experiences that match the job listing.\n\n3. **Simple Formatting**: Use a clean, straightforward format. Avoid using tables, columns, images, or other complex formatting that ATS might not be able to parse. Bullet points are fine, but keep the layout simple.\n\n4. **File Format**: Submit your resume in a format compatible with most ATS, which is usually a .docx or a plain-text file. While PDFs are great for preserving layout, some ATS systems may have trouble reading them.\n\n5. **Professional Font**: Use standard, professional fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. Keep the font size within 10-12 points for readability.\n\n6. **Avoid Headers and Footers**: Some ATS systems cannot read information placed in headers and footers. Make sure all critical information is within the main body of the document.\n\n7. **Spell Out Acronyms**: Spell out acronyms the first time you use them, followed by the acronym in parentheses. This ensures that whether the ATS searches for the acronym or the full phrase, your resume will be found.\n\n8. **Performance and Results**: Emphasize results and achievements using numbers and specifics that align with the job description&#x27;s keywords and phrases.\n\n9. **Language and Tense**: Use clear, concise language and maintain consistent tense. Present tense for current roles and past tense for previous positions.\n\n10. **Customize for the Job**: Tailor your resume for each application based on the job description. This increases the relevance of your resume to the specific position and makes it more likely to get past the ATS.\n\nIf you have your resume ready and would like a detailed analysis or any specific advice tailored to your resume, feel free to share it for personalized feedback."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Given the job involves managing the hiring process, innovation, and a mix of specific tasks and generalist responsibilities, here&#x27;s how you might adjust your resume:\n\n### Revised Summary\nVersatile business innovator with a proven track record in enhancing user engagement and leading successful projects across diverse industries. Known for a unique blend of humor, exceptional people skills, and an ability to thrive in dynamic, unconventional environments. Eager to contribute to a team that values creativity, direct communication, and genuinely despises corporate nonsense.\n\n### Tailored Work Experience\n1. **Acadly Inc. \u2013 San Francisco, CA**\n   - **Customer Success Wizard** (2022 - 2023)\n     - Revolutionized customer satisfaction through innovative relationship-building strategies, boosting user happiness by an unbelievable 20%.\n     - Spearheaded a guerrilla marketing campaign, leading to a 15% spike in leads by annoyingly persistent personalized emails and strategic cold calls.\n\n2. **Commercial Fire \u2013 Jacksonville, FL**\n   - **Firefighter of Customer Needs** (2022)\n     - Extinguished customer complaints with an 86% success rate in on-time fire system inspections, managing a portfolio worth over half a million.\n\n3. **Revature \u2013 Tampa, FL**\n   - **Software Development Maverick** (2019 \u2013 2020)\n     - Coded and debugged like a lone wolf in the tech wilderness, delivering projects that boosted system performance by 15%.\n\n4. **PED Academy \u2013 Prague, Czech Republic**\n   - **English Language Alchemist and TEFL Sorcerer** (2017 \u2013 2018)\n     - Transformed the mundane into magic, using storytelling games to improve students&#x27; English by 15% without them even noticing.\n\n### Skills and Attributes\n- **Innovative Problem-Solving**: Regularly turning &quot;That&#x27;s impossible&quot; into &quot;It&#x27;s already done.&quot;\n- **Adaptability in High-Stress Environments**: Thrives among chaos, infighting, and tight deadlines, turning tension into productive energy.\n- **Communication Mastery**: Expert at talking smack to higher-ups in a way that surprisingly earns their respect.\n- **Anti-BS Approach**: A natural detector and dismantler of corporate jargon and unnecessary procedures.\n- **Learning and Growth**: Invests time in daily learning, even if it&#x27;s how not to be a corporate drone.\n\n### Education (Slightly Tweaked)\n- Highlight the degrees but add a twist showing your readiness for continuous learning and disdain for traditional paths when unnecessary.\n\n### Cover Letter Note (To Add Personality)\nConsider starting your cover letter with a humorous anecdote or a bold statement that reflects the tone of the job ad. For example, &quot;As someone who once convinced a group of software developers that &#x27;JavaScript&#x27; was a new coffee blend, I believe I&#x27;m ready to take on your challenge of finding diamonds in the rough.&quot;\n\n### Final Touch\nAlign your resume with the company&#x27;s disdain for corporate nonsense by explicitly stating how your experiences have prepared you for a culture that values results over sucking up to the boss, hates bureaucracy, and genuinely values its people.\n\nRemember, the goal is to stand out by mirroring the job ad&#x27;s unique tone while showcasing your relevant skills and experiences. This approach should catch the eye of a company that prides itself on being different."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values.

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor! \n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

However, even with nuclear reactions, the concept of creating a perpetual motion machine faces significant challenges and limitations.\n\nFirstly, in a nuclear reaction where atoms are split (nuclear fission) or combined (nuclear fusion), enormous amounts of energy are released. This energy can indeed be harnessed to initiate further reactions. In fact, this principle is what underpins the operation of nuclear reactors. They use the energy released from fission reactions to maintain a chain reaction, which can be controlled to produce energy over time.\n\nHowever, there are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Resource Limitation**: While atoms are abundant, not all atoms are suitable for sustaining nuclear reactions that release energy. Fission, for example, typically uses isotopes like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, which are not unlimited and require mining and refinement. Fusion, on the other hand, while potentially using more abundant fuels like hydrogen isotopes, still faces enormous technical challenges to maintain and control the reaction.\n\n2. **Energy Losses**: Even in nuclear reactions, not all the energy released can be perfectly captured and used to initiate further reactions. Some energy is always lost to the surroundings as heat. In practical engineering, achieving 100% efficiency in energy conversion is impossible due to these inevitable losses.\n\n3. **Decay and Byproducts**: Nuclear reactions produce radioactive byproducts that must be managed. Over time, the materials used in the reaction can also degrade and become less effective, requiring replacement.\n\nSo, while nuclear reactions can produce vast amounts of energy and can be harnessed in reactors to provide a significant energy source, they don&#x27;t create a perpetual motion machine. The process doesn&#x27;t sustain itself indefinitely without external inputs, such as fuel and maintenance, and it&#x27;s subject to the limitations of efficiency and resource availability.\n\nThis exploration into nuclear energy does highlight how tapping into the fundamental forces of nature can yield incredible power, showcasing the endless quest for more efficient and sustainable energy sources within the bounds of physical laws."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, there are several scientific and technical challenges that make such a system, especially as a &quot;perpetual energy machine,&quot; unfeasible with our current understanding and technology.\n\n### Fission and Fusion Basics\n- **Nuclear Fission** is the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei (such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239) into lighter elements, releasing a significant amount of energy. The byproducts of fission are usually a mix of lighter radioactive isotopes and neutrons.\n- **Nuclear Fusion** involves combining light atomic nuclei (such as isotopes of Hydrogen, Deuterium, and Tritium) into heavier nuclei (like Helium), also releasing a vast amount of energy. The conditions for fusion require extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between atomic nuclei.\n\n### Challenges and Considerations\n1. **Different Conditions**: Fission and fusion require vastly different conditions to proceed. Fusion, in particular, requires temperatures and pressures found at the core of stars, which are challenging to achieve and maintain on Earth.\n  \n2. **Material Limitations**: The byproducts of fission are not suitable fuels for fusion. Fission byproducts are typically mid-range atomic number isotopes that are not easily fused. Fusion fuel (like Deuterium and Tritium) is much lighter than these materials.\n  \n3. **Energy Efficiency**: While both processes release energy, converting the byproducts of one process into the fuel for another involves steps that are not 100% efficient. There are always energy losses to the surroundings, and the energy required to convert materials or to initiate reactions (like achieving the conditions for fusion) can exceed the energy gained.\n  \n4. **Radioactive Waste**: Fission, in particular, produces radioactive waste that poses significant environmental and safety challenges. Managing this waste requires resources and can&#x27;t be efficiently turned into a benign or useful state simply through fusion.\n  \n5. **Technological Feasibility**: Currently, controlled fusion as a net energy producer is not yet a practical technology, though research is ongoing. Even if it were, the seamless integration with fission in a cycle as described would require technologies and materials beyond our current capabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe concept you&#x27;ve described touches on the heart of experimental energy research\u2014finding efficient, sustainable ways to produce energy. However, as of now, a system that cycles between fission and fusion in the manner described, acting as a perpetual energy machine, isn&#x27;t possible due to the fundamental laws of physics, material limitations, and technological constraints.\n\nExploring these ideas is essential for pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and capabilities, and who knows what future discoveries might bring in the field of nuclear physics and energy production!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Harnessing energy from the repulsion between atoms involves understanding these forces and how they can be manipulated or utilized in practical applications.\n\n### The Basics of Atomic Repulsion\nAtoms repel each other when their electron clouds or positively charged nuclei come into close proximity, due to the electromagnetic force. This force is incredibly strong at very short distances, which is why you can&#x27;t easily push atoms together; they resist due to this repulsion.\n\n### Potential Applications and Challenges\n1. **Fusion Energy**: In a way, nuclear fusion research is trying to do something similar to what you&#x27;re suggesting. Fusion involves pushing light atomic nuclei close enough together that they overcome their electromagnetic repulsion and fuse into a heavier nucleus, releasing energy. This process requires immense temperatures and pressures to overcome the repulsive force between the nuclei.\n\n2. **Particle Accelerators**: Particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider, use electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged particles to high speeds and then smash them together. The collisions release energy and a variety of subatomic particles, allowing scientists to study the fundamental components of matter. This is a controlled way of harnessing energy from the interactions between particles, though it&#x27;s used for research rather than practical energy production.\n\n### Energy Production Challenges\n- **Efficiency**: Any process designed to harness energy from the repulsion between atoms would need to consider energy input versus output. Overcoming the repulsive forces to bring atoms close enough together requires a significant energy investment, which, in most practical scenarios, exceeds the energy that can be harvested from the repulsion.\n\n- **Control and Safety**: Managing the forces involved in such high-energy interactions requires sophisticated technology to control and contain, ensuring safety and preventing uncontrolled releases of energy.\n\n- **Sustainability**: For any energy production method to be viable, it needs to be sustainable and efficient over long periods. This involves not just the energy balance but also the availability of materials and the environmental impact.\n\nWhile the idea of harnessing energy from atomic repulsion is intriguing and taps into real physics principles, practical applications like nuclear fusion are still under development and face significant technical challenges.

These experiments aim to understand the fundamental forces of nature, the basic constituents of matter, and the properties of particles that make up the universe. The collisions create conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang, allowing researchers to study a range of fundamental physics questions.\n\n### Elements and Charges\nIn terms of elements being &quot;singularly charged, but oppositely charged,&quot; all atoms consist of a nucleus containing protons (positively charged) and neutrons (no charge), surrounded by electrons (negatively charged). The entire atom is electrically neutral if it has an equal number of protons and electrons. There aren&#x27;t elements with overall singular, opposite charges; charges within atoms are balanced between the positive nucleus and negative electrons. However, ions are atoms or molecules that have lost or gained electrons and thus carry a net charge.\n\n### Utilizing Particle Colliders for Energy\nIf your idea involves using particle accelerators like those at CERN to harness energy from the electromagnetic repulsion or attraction between charged particles, there are several points to consider:\n\n1. **Purpose of Colliders**: Particle colliders are research tools designed to understand the laws of physics at the smallest scales, not to produce or harness energy for practical use. The energy produced in these collisions is used to create new particles and explore fundamental physics, not for external energy capture.\n\n2. **Energy Efficiency**: The amount of energy required to accelerate particles to the speeds needed for these experiments is immense. The energy recovered from the interactions, while scientifically invaluable, is much less than the energy input. Thus, particle accelerators are net consumers of energy, not sources.\n\n3. **Oppositely Charged Particles**: When oppositely charged particles, like electrons and positrons (the electron&#x27;s antiparticle), collide, they can annihilate, producing energy primarily in the form of high-energy photons (light). This process, while energetically efficient at the particle level, does not lend itself to large-scale energy production due to the challenges in creating, containing, and efficiently using antimatter.\n\n### Practical Energy Production\nFor practical energy production, technologies strive for processes where the energy output exceeds the energy input, like in nuclear fission reactors and, potentially, future fusion reactors. These processes involve large numbers of atoms and reactions that release substantial amounts of energy, more suitable for generating electricity on a scale that can power cities.\n\nIn summary, while particle colliders provide invaluable insights into the fundamental aspects of the universe, they are not designed or suitable for acting as energy production facilities in the way traditional power plants are. The study of charged particles and their interactions, however, continues to be a crucial part of advancing our understanding of physics and could indirectly lead to new energy technologies in the future."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, there are a few key considerations that highlight the challenges and inefficiencies of this approach:\n\n1. **Energy Efficiency**: Particle colliders, like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, consume a vast amount of energy to accelerate particles to near the speed of light and collide them. The primary goal of these collisions is to study fundamental physics, not to produce energy. The amount of light (in the form of high-energy photons) generated from particle collisions is minuscule compared to the energy input required to operate the collider. Thus, the process is highly inefficient from an energy production standpoint.\n\n2. **Cost and Complexity**: Particle colliders are among the most complex and expensive scientific instruments ever built, designed for advanced research in physics. The cost of building and operating such facilities is enormous, further compounded by the need for highly specialized personnel and infrastructure.\n\n3. **Conversion Efficiency**: Even if we could harvest light from particle collisions, the efficiency of solar panels in converting light to electricity is not 100%. Current commercial solar panels typically have efficiencies ranging from 15% to 22%. This conversion efficiency would further reduce the overall energy efficiency of using colliders for this purpose.\n\n4. **Practicality and Scale**: The scale of energy production from such a process would be extremely limited. Solar panels are most effective when capturing sunlight, which provides a much larger and consistent energy source. The amount of light produced in particle collisions would be insufficient to power more than a very small load, if that.\n\n5. **Safety and Accessibility**: The environments within particle colliders are highly controlled and can be hazardous due to high energy levels and radiation produced during collisions. It would not be practical or safe to integrate such a system with external devices like solar panels.\n\nWhile it&#x27;s important to explore various ideas for producing and harvesting energy, the efficiency and practicality of those ideas are key. Currently, focusing on improving the efficiency of solar panels to capture sunlight directly, or advancing technologies in other renewable energy sectors like wind, hydro, and fusion, offers more promising pathways toward sustainable energy production. The exploration of high-energy physics, while crucial for our understanding of the universe, serves different objectives than those of energy production for practical use."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Silicon is a semiconductor, which means it can conduct electricity under certain conditions. This property makes it ideal for converting light into electrical energy.\n\nThere are two main types of silicon used in solar panels:\n\n1. **Monocrystalline Silicon**: Made from single-crystal silicon, monocrystalline panels are easily recognizable by their uniform dark color and rounded edges. They are more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity compared to other types, but they&#x27;re also more expensive. This efficiency comes from the high purity of silicon, which allows electrons to move more freely through the material.\n\n2. **Polycrystalline Silicon (or Multicrystalline Silicon)**: These panels are made from silicon crystals that are melted together. Polycrystalline panels have a blue, somewhat speckled appearance, resulting from the light reflecting off the crystals. They are less efficient than monocrystalline silicon panels but also cheaper to produce.\n\nBesides silicon, solar panels also contain other materials:\n\n- **Glass**: A durable, transparent layer on top that protects the silicon cells while allowing sunlight to pass through.\n- **Metal**: Used in the framing of the panel and the wiring that connects the cells, helping to transport the generated electricity.\n- **Plastic and Other Materials**: Used for the back sheet and encapsulation, providing insulation and protection against environmental conditions.\n\nAdvancements in solar technology have also led to the development of thin-film solar cells, which use materials like cadmium telluride (CdTe) or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). These materials can be applied in thin layers to create flexible, lightweight panels, although they are generally less efficient than silicon-based panels. Despite the differences in materials and efficiency, the goal of all solar panels is the same: to convert sunlight into usable electricity as effectively as possible."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

These multi-junction cells are designed to capture a broader range of the solar spectrum compared to traditional silicon-based solar panels.\n\nMulti-junction solar cells are made up of multiple layers of semiconductor materials, each layer designed to absorb a different segment of the solar spectrum. This layered design allows them to convert more of the sunlight they receive into electricity, making them significantly more efficient than single-junction cells, such as those made of silicon. The materials used in these layers can include combinations of gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) among others.\n\nThese high-efficiency solar cells are particularly valuable in space because they produce more power while taking up less space and weight compared to other types of solar cells. This efficiency is crucial for space missions, where the amount of energy that can be generated is limited by the size of the solar panels a spacecraft can carry. However, the advanced materials and technology required to produce multi-junction cells make them much more expensive than conventional solar panels, which is why their use is usually limited to space applications and some high-end terrestrial projects.\n\nAdditionally, for missions that venture far from the Sun, where sunlight is weaker, NASA has sometimes used Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) to provide power. These devices generate electricity from the heat released by the decay of radioactive materials, independent of sunlight, making them suitable for exploring the outer solar system."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It&#x27;s designed to evaluate both your analytical skills in deconstructing a complex skill into its component parts, and your ability to craft an effective method for assessing mastery of those components. Designing a mastery test like this, particularly for something as nuanced as public speaking, involves a few critical steps. Here\u2019s a general outline of how you might approach it:\n\n### 1. Identify Sub-skills of Public Speaking\n\nFirst, break down public speaking into its core sub-skills. These can include, but are not limited to:\n\n- **Content Creation:** Crafting engaging and coherent speeches.\n- **Verbal Communication:** Clarity, pace, tone, and variety in speech.\n- **Non-verbal Communication:** Body language, gestures, facial expressions.\n- **Audience Engagement:** Connecting with the audience, holding attention, and managing feedback.\n- **Anxiety Management:** Techniques for handling public speaking nerves.\n- **Use of Visual Aids:** Effectively incorporating slides, videos, or objects.\n- **Adaptability:** Adjusting the speech on-the-fly based on audience reaction or other factors.\n\n### 2. Choose One Sub-skill for Deep Dive\n\nSelect one of these sub-skills for a more focused analysis. Let\u2019s say you choose **Audience Engagement** as the sub-skill to develop a mastery test for.\n\n### 3. Define Mastery for the Chosen Sub-skill\n\nClarify what mastery looks like for this specific sub-skill. For audience engagement, mastery might involve the speaker&#x27;s ability to:\n\n- Read the room and adjust their delivery accordingly.\n- Ask questions or prompt interactions that keep the audience involved and thinking.\n- Use storytelling or examples that resonate with the audience.\n\n### 4. Design the Mastery Test\n\nDevelop a test that accurately measures a speaker&#x27;s mastery of audience engagement. This could involve:\n\n- **Live Speech Delivery:** The speaker delivers a short presentation to an audience (real or simulated), with specific objectives around audience engagement.\n- **Feedback Mechanism:** Include immediate audience feedback tools, such as live polling or reaction meters, to gauge engagement in real-time.\n- **Reflective Analysis:** Ask the speaker to reflect on their performance, specifically focusing on how they engaged the audience and what they might do differently.\n\n### 5. Criteria for Evaluation\n\nEstablish clear, objective criteria for evaluating the mastery test. This might include:\n\n- **Engagement Metrics:** Utilization of audience feedback tools, time spent with high audience engagement, etc.\n- **Observer Ratings:** Ratings from impartial observers on how effectively the speaker engaged the audience.\n- **Self-assessment:** The speaker&#x27;s own analysis of their performance, particularly their self-identified strengths and areas for improvement in engagement.\n\n### 6. Feedback and Improvement\n\nDesign the assessment so that it provides constructive feedback, allowing individuals to understand their performance and identify specific areas for improvement.\n\nBy following these steps, you create a structured path to not only dissect and understand a complex skill like public speaking but also to measure and improve upon it in a concrete way. This approach encourages deep learning and personal development, which are critical in mastering any skill."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It has all the must have DJ tools too!\n\nThis also won&#x27;t work with any hardware, so you can only control it via a mouse and keyboard - which isn&#x27;t an ideal way to mix music live.\n\nUnlike rekordbox, \u301024\u2020Traktor Pro \u3011(the paid version) will work with pretty much any DJ controller you can find, making it much more versatile and a better way to mix songs on a budget.\n\n### 4) Mixxx\u301025\u2020#\u3011\n\n[Image 6: Mixxx Free DJ Software]\n\n#### Features \n\n  * Completely free - open source DJ software \n\n  * Mix on four decks \n\n  * Pitch and key control \n\n  * Beat matching and looping \n\n  * Master sync \n\n  * Works with hardware \n\n  * Decent effects \n\n#### Limitations \n\n  * A bit ugly (sorry!)\n\n  * Many bugs \n\n  * Limited library manager \n\n#### Info \n\nMixxx is unique, in the fact that it&#x27;s a totally free, open-source piece of software. Maybe this makes it the best free software - as it&#x27;s the only one here that is totally free!\n\nThis gives you a wide range of features, for $0.00! It has enough for beginner and experienced DJs alike.\n\nThe only downside is that it&#x27;s a bit clunky, unrefined, and ugly. That said, it&#x27;s definitely a viable option for DJs on a budget. It&#x27;s community-driven, so it might not have the singular vision of a commercial program and does feel a bit scatterbrained.\n\nIt will, however, work with almost any DJ controller, as you can simply map out what each button controls.\n\n### 5) Serato DJ Lite\u301026\u2020#\u3011\n\n[Image 7: Serato DJ Lite]\n\n#### Features \n\n  * Integrates with streaming services \n\n  * Use Serato Stems \n\n  * Mixing, scratching, and effects \n\n#### Limitations \n\n  * No recording \n\n  * Basic sync features \n\n  * Limited key analysis \n\n#### Info \n\nIf you&#x27;re looking to learn the basics of Serato, Serato DJ Lite is the place to be! This gives you the basic features of Serato, in a timeless free trial.\n\nIt has tools for creating live remixes, including the ability to add sound effects and loops. It even lets you stream music from other websites directly into the app.\n\nUpgrading to Serato DJ Pro gives you a bunch of other cool features, including the ability to use timecode vinyl records, which gives you the feel of mixing on vinyl, but with the flexibility and power of a digital setup.\n\n### 6) Virtual DJ Free\u301027\u2020#\u3011\n\n[Image 8: VirtualDJ Free]\n\n#### Features \n\n  * Up to 99 deck mixing \n\n  * Decent library management \n\n  * Effects and a good mixer \n\n  * Virtual DJ Can record mixes \n\n#### Limitations \n\n  * No hardware support \n\n  * Recording is limited \n\n  * Not allowed for pro use (earning money)\n\n#### Virtual DJ Info \n\nVirtualDJ is another big name in the DJ software scene and has a feature-full free version that has enough tools for most situations. It doesn&#x27;t have all the power of a full, professional piece of software, but Virtual DJ is great for new starters.\n\nVirtual DJ has many similar limitations to others, such as lacking the ability to work with hardware, restrictions on the features, and a limited set of effects. Although, Virtual DJ can record your mixes which is a nice addition.\n\n## Things to Look for in Free DJ Software: A Buyer&#x27;s Guide\u301028\u2020#\u3011\n\n[Image 9: free dj sfotware buyer-s guide.png]\n\nWhen venturing into the world of DJing, finding the right software can be a daunting task, especially for new DJs. \n\nNo-cost DJ apps can be a great starting point, but it&#x27;s crucial to know what features are essential to help you play tracks, stream tracks, and ultimately create an engaging mix. \n\nHere&#x27;s a buyer&#x27;s guide to help you understand what to look for in free music mixing software, ensuring that your transition into DJing is as smooth and enjoyable as possible.\n\nNote, than many of these features are locked behind a professional plan, and may not be included in the basic free version. \n\n### Easy for New DJs#\n\nIf you&#x27;re a new DJ, the world of mixing can be overwhelming.

It&#x27;s a fantastic way to keep your audience involved and ensures that your set meets the vibe of the room.\n\n### Multiple Effects: Elevate Your Mix#\n\nTo truly stand out, having a range of \u301029\u2020DJ effects\u3011 at your disposal is crucial.

Blaze\n\n[Image 25: Blaze Free DJ Software][Image 26: Blaze Free DJ Software]\n\nAlthough \u301017\u2020Blaze\u2020www.blaze.dj\u3011 is technically a free DJing application, the catch is that you have to keep reopening the demo version every 30 minutes or so, which is just as annoying as it sounds.\n\nHowever, we still included it on the list as it is excellent software and does allow you to get a feel for DJing if you\u2019re a beginner.\n\nWhen it comes to tracks, Blaze integrates with SoundCloud, so you\u2019ll get access to millions of songs that can be added to your playlists within a blink of the eye.\n\nRead More &gt;&gt; \u301018\u2020Where Do DJs Get Their Music?\u3011\n\nIt has a super clean interface, with frequency layered waveforms, and comes with all the basic modern digital software functions, such as Loops, Filters, Band-Equalizers, and Cues.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get access to features like tempo and beat tracking, as well as built-in audio file effects, time-code supports, and MIDI presets, and custom mapping, which makes it easy to connect your favorite DJ controller.\n\nAll in all, we think Blaze Pro is the best option to go for, but the free version is good enough to test the water until you\u2019re ready to step up to the full version.\n\nThis tutorial video shows you how to use MIDI mapping in Blaze:\n\n## 11.

You have access to the track waveform view, library view, track management and transport controls, a crossfader, tempo controls, hot cues and loops.\n\n\u301044\u2020Serato DJ Lite vs. Pro (12 Most Important Differences)\u3011\n\nIf you do have a Serato DJ Lite compatible controller, you can basically use the very same features and some more (like audio FX) with an aid of physical controls.\n\nAlthough this doesn\u2019t sound half bad, the limitations of Serato DJ Lite software are vast. One example is, in Serato DJ Lite you are not able to utilize audio loops smaller than 1 beat or larger than 8 beats. Every other DJ software on the market, including Serato DJ Pro let you do that.\n\nTo sum it up perfectly, it is free, but is sure is extremely limited in \u301044\u2020comparison to the \u201cfull\u201d version of Seratto DJ software \u2013 Serato DJ Pro.\u3011\n\nOfficial website: \u301045\u2020https://serato.com/dj/lite\u2020serato.com\u3011\n\nOur rating: 6/10 \u2013 really limited but can get the job done.\n\n## 4.

This one is designed to be compatible with just Hercules DJ brand controllers, but to a certain degree in can function in the so-called \u201coffline mode\u201d.\n\nWhen downloaded and started up without a compatible DJ controller connected, DJUCED software gives you access to the offline mode with music library management section and limited mixing features. Keep in mind that offline mode features are meant to be used for mix preparation, rather than for an actual live performance.\n\nThe DJUCED software also features an extensive knowledge base and manual section on their website which can be really helpful if you\u2019re just starting out.\n\nOfficial website: \u301047\u2020https://www.djuced.com/\u2020www.djuced.com\u3011\n\nOur rating: 5/10 \u2013 great support for Hercules DJ controllers, very limited without a compatible DJ controller plugged in.\n\n## 5.

It allows for broad experimentation with tracks, including effects, loops, and more, albeit with the noted limitation that it cannot be used with external DJ controllers in the free version for more than 15 minutes at a time. However, for software-based DJing (without a controller), it provides a comprehensive set of tools and integrates well with a computer&#x27;s keyboard and mouse, offering a wide array of features such as real-time stem separation, video mixing, and streaming integration\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n\n**Mixxx**, on the other hand, is celebrated for its open-source nature and the robust community support it enjoys. It offers features like four-deck mixing, waveforms, EQ and crossfader controls, effects, and much more. It supports a wide range of DJ controllers right out of the box and allows for extensive customization through MIDI mapping. Mixxx&#x27;s open-source platform means that new features and updates are regularly added by the community. While it might not have some of the more advanced proprietary features of Virtual DJ, like real-time stem separation, it is incredibly powerful and flexible for a free software\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn conclusion, if you&#x27;re looking for sheer volume of features and capabilities without considering external hardware, Virtual DJ&#x27;s free version might edge out Mixxx. However, if open-source software, community support, and extensive hardware compatibility are important to you, then Mixxx would be the better choice. Both platforms are excellent starting points for beginners and can be quite capable for even seasoned DJs, depending on the specific needs and preferences."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The addition of a keyboard to your setup enhances your ability to perform complex mixes with either software, thanks to the ease of triggering and controlling functions without needing to navigate through on-screen menus.\n\nRemember, the best way to decide is by testing both:\n\n- Virtual DJ: [https://virtualdj.com/](https://virtualdj.com/)\n- Mixxx: [https://mixxx.org/](https://mixxx.org/)\n\nExperiment with both programs to discover which one better fits your workflow, especially with the keyboard shortcuts and functions that are critical for efficient DJing."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Avoid overly casual or inappropriate email handles.\r\n\r\nAlways triple-check your contact information for accuracy. A single typo in your phone number or email address could cost you the opportunity.\r\n\r\nEmphasize achievements over responsibilities when possible. Hiring managers are more interested in how you excelled in your role and contributed to the company&#x27;s success.\r\n\r\nGood Example: Consistently exceeded quarterly sales targets by an average of 18% for 7 consecutive quarters.\r\n\r\nBad Example: Responsible for generating leads through cold calling.\r\n\r\nInclude only work experience that is relevant to the position you are applying for. If you&#x27;re applying for a role in marketing, your previous experience in finance may not be pertinent.\r\nIf you are a recent graduate with limited work experience, highlight other relevant experiences such as internships, volunteer work, and personal projects. If you lack these experiences, proactively seek out opportunities to gain skills and experiences that will be valuable for your desired career path.\r\nEven seemingly unrelated work experience, such as a part-time job in retail while pursuing a degree in software engineering, can demonstrate a strong work ethic and transferable skills.\r\n\r\nQuantify your experiences and achievements with specific data and metrics whenever possible. This helps you stand out from other candidates and showcases your impact in previous roles.\r\nDO: Optimized the company&#x27;s Google Ads account, increasing the click-through rate (CTR) from 2.1% to 4.7% and reducing the cost per acquisition (CPA) by 32%.\r\n\r\nDON&#x27;T: Managed the company&#x27;s Google Ads account.\r\n\r\nIf you are transitioning to a new career, address this in your resume summary. For example:\r\n&quot;Experienced sales professional with 6+ years in the industry seeking to transition into a role as a data analyst. Completed a data science certification program and worked on several freelance data analysis projects for small businesses.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates that you are intentionally pursuing a career change and highlights any relevant experience or training you have in the new field.\r\n\r\nAvoid the &quot;spray and pray&quot; approach of applying to dozens of jobs per day with a generic resume. Instead, focus on carefully selecting a handful of well-suited positions and tailoring your application to each one.\r\nTo effectively tailor your resume, thoroughly review the job description and identify the key skills and responsibilities required for the role. Ensure that your resume highlights your relevant skills and experiences, even if they weren&#x27;t the primary focus of your previous positions.\r\nKeep your resume concise and limit it to one page, unless you have extensive relevant experience spanning more than 15 years. Focus on the most important and relevant information for the position you are applying for.\r\nAvoid using generic buzzwords and phrases like &quot;detail-oriented,&quot; &quot;team player,&quot; or &quot;excellent communication skills.&quot; Instead, provide specific examples that demonstrate these qualities through your achievements and experiences.\r\nUnless specifically requested or culturally expected in your country, do not include a photo on your resume.\r\nConsider using a tool like MailTrack to monitor when your resume is opened by a recruiter. This can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your application and help you determine when to follow up.\r\nIf you have completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, it is generally unnecessary to include information about your high school education.\r\nAlways proofread your resume for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors. Utilize tools like Grammarly or ask a trusted friend or family member to review it for you.\r\nA hobbies and interests section can be included if you have extra space and no additional relevant experience to highlight. However, keep in mind that this section is unlikely to be a deciding factor in whether you are selected for an interview.\r\nIf you haven&#x27;t received a response within a week of submitting your application, consider following up with the recruiter or hiring manager. Use an email tracking tool to determine whether your initial application was opened, and tailor your follow-up message accordingly.\r\nRemember that resume advice can be subjective and may vary depending on the recruiter, industry, and company culture. Be open to feedback and willing to adapt your approach, but also trust your instincts and highlight the experiences and skills that make you a unique and valuable candidate.", "title": "resume tips.txt", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "parent_id": "91d3575d-d292-48b1-8b3e-7ffce8109a72", "request_id": "871c8212b90c74ee-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "91d3575d-d292-48b1-8b3e-7ffce8109a72", "children": ["e0e11f4d-425a-4352-9271-e1402fc54731"]}, "e0e11f4d-425a-4352-9271-e1402fc54731": {"id": "e0e11f4d-425a-4352-9271-e1402fc54731", "message": {"id": "e0e11f4d-425a-4352-9271-e1402fc54731", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712686803.629263, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "tether_quote", "url": "file-tachYYoDVM4f2reEoQAy8xU3", "domain": "resume templates API - how to create and edit.docx", "text": "# Generating or updating a resume\n\n- If the user asks about available templates show them all examples available.\n- ALWAYS show this example resume BEFORE ANY OTHER information to the user and render it inline like so.

With a rich background in customer success, project management, and technical troubleshooting, combined with my passion for delivering exceptional customer service, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Rinsed\u2019s mission of revolutionizing the car wash industry through innovative software solutions.\n\nIn my recent role as a Customer Success Manager at Acadly, Inc., I was instrumental in enhancing user satisfaction and engagement by nurturing impactful relationships and leading CRM strategies. This experience honed my ability to understand and meet customer needs, a skill set that aligns perfectly with the responsibilities of a Customer Support Specialist at Rinsed. My technical proficiency was further developed at Revature, where I contributed to software enhancements, increasing performance by 15%, and boosting user engagement through a web-based application.\n\nWhat excites me most about the opportunity at Rinsed is the chance to be part of a fast-growing startup with a clear vision for the future. Your commitment to providing car washes with the tools they need to transition to a subscription model is inspiring, and I am eager to bring my expertise in customer support and technical troubleshooting to the team. My experience working in fast-paced environments has equipped me with the ability to manage multiple tasks efficiently, prioritize effectively, and work collaboratively with teams to resolve issues promptly.\n\nI am particularly drawn to Rinsed\u2019s dedication to building a great product, culture, and company, values that resonate deeply with my professional ethos. I am excited about the prospect of working closely with the Customer Success and Engineering teams to ensure a speedy diagnosis, prioritization, and resolution of all issues, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms can contribute to the continued success and growth of Rinsed. I am available at your convenience for an interview and can be reached at [Your Phone Number] or via email at alexislindsay@yahoo.com.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\nAlexis Lindsay\n\n---\n\nPlease customize the placeholders (like [Your Address], [City, State, Zip], and [Today\u2019s Date]) with your actual information.

Most modern web browsers and word processors can interpret HTML and offer a print-to-PDF feature that you can use to ensure the content fits onto one page. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using a Browser:**\n   - Copy the HTML code into a new file and save it with a `.html` extension.\n   - Open the file in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).\n   - Adjust the zoom level and margins by selecting &quot;Print&quot; from the browser menu, then &quot;More settings&quot; to ensure the content fits on one page.\n   - Select &quot;Save as PDF&quot; as the destination and click &quot;Save&quot;.\n\n2. **Using Word Processor:**\n   - Open a new document in a word processor (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs) that supports HTML.\n   - Insert the HTML code. In Google Docs, you can go to `File` &gt; `Open` &gt; `Upload` to open the HTML file directly.\n   - Adjust the document settings (margins, font size, etc.) to fit the content onto one page.\n   - Save or export the document as a PDF.\n\nFor the content to fit nicely on one page, you might need to:\n- Reduce the margins to 0.5 inches on all sides.\n- Use a slightly smaller font size for less critical sections if necessary.\n- Ensure there are no large spaces or breaks that could push content to the second page.\n\nIf you&#x27;re looking for a more automated solution or if you encounter any difficulties with these steps, there are online HTML to PDF converters that can also help adjust the layout to fit a single page. \n\nWould you need further assistance on this or any other requests?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are several strategies:\n\n1. **Phonemic Awareness**: Focus on individual sounds that are challenging, such as the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds in &quot;french fries&quot;. Korean doesn&#x27;t have these exact sounds, so it&#x27;s crucial to start with isolation exercises. Use minimal pairs (words that only have a one-sound difference) to train the ear and mouth, like &quot;fan&quot; vs &quot;van&quot; for the &quot;f&quot; sound.\n\n2. **Mouth Position and Movement**: Show how to position the lips, tongue, and jaw for tricky sounds. The &quot;f&quot; sound, for example, is made by lightly biting the lower lip with the upper teeth and blowing air out. The &quot;r&quot; sound in English is unique, and showing the tongue placement and movement can help. Use a mirror or video to provide visual feedback.\n\n3. **Listening and Imitation**: Listening to native speakers and trying to imitate their pronunciation can be incredibly helpful. Use videos, songs, or podcasts. Slow down the audio if possible so they can catch the nuances of the pronunciation.\n\n4. **Tongue Twisters and Practice Sentences**: Use tongue twisters and sentences that incorporate challenging sounds multiple times. This not only practices the sound but also improves fluency in connecting sounds together.\n\n5. **Recording and Feedback**: Encourage recording their own pronunciation. This allows for self-assessment and for you to provide specific feedback. Sometimes, what we think we sound like and what we actually sound like can be quite different.\n\n6. **Linking Sounds and Rhythms**: English has a rhythm that can affect pronunciation. Work on linking sounds and the natural rhythm of English sentences, as this can change the pronunciation and stress patterns of words within a sentence.\n\n7. **Consistent Practice and Patience**: Pronunciation improvement is a slow process that requires regular practice and patience. Encourage consistency and celebrate small improvements to maintain motivation.\n\n8. **Engage with Native Speakers**: If possible, conversing with native English speakers can provide real-life practice and feedback. This can be done through language exchange meetups or online platforms.\n\n9. **Use Technology**: Apps and online resources specifically designed for pronunciation can provide structured practice and feedback. Look for ones that use speech recognition technology to give immediate feedback.\n\n10. **Understand Phonetic Transcription**: Learning the basics of phonetic transcription, especially the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), can help understand how sounds are produced in a more technical way.\n\nRemember, the goal is clear communication, not perfection. Encouraging confidence and a positive attitude towards learning will also go a long way in improving pronunciation."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here&#x27;s how you can improve your English pronunciation, especially for tricky words like &quot;french fries&quot;:\n\n1. **Start with Sounds**: Focus on the individual sounds that are giving you trouble. For &quot;french fries&quot;, the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds might be new to you. Practice these sounds on their own first, using pairs of words that differ by just one sound, like &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;van&quot; for the &quot;f&quot; sound. This will help train both your ears and your mouth.\n\n2. **Learn the Right Mouth Moves**: Pay attention to how to position your lips, tongue, and jaw for these sounds. For the &quot;f&quot; sound, you&#x27;ll need to bite your lower lip lightly with your upper teeth and blow air out. For the &quot;r&quot; sound, notice how the tongue is positioned and moves. Use a mirror or record videos of yourself to make sure you&#x27;re doing it right.\n\n3. **Listen and Repeat**: Try listening to how native speakers say these words and phrases. You can find videos, songs, or podcasts online. If you can, slow the audio down to catch all the details, and then mimic what you hear.\n\n4. **Tongue Twisters and Practice Sentences**: Practice with tongue twisters and sentences that have lots of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds. This will help you get used to saying these sounds in different words and improve your fluency.\n\n5. **Record Yourself**: It&#x27;s really helpful to record your own pronunciation. You can listen back to see how close you are to the sounds you&#x27;re aiming for, and it&#x27;s a great way to track your progress over time.\n\n6. **Learn the Rhythm**: English has its own rhythm, and the way sounds connect can change how words are pronounced. Practice the natural flow of sentences to improve how naturally your pronunciation sounds.\n\n7. **Keep at It**: Improving your pronunciation takes time and regular practice. Try to stay consistent and be patient with yourself. Celebrate your improvements, no matter how small they might seem!\n\n8. **Talk with Native Speakers**: If you can, practice speaking with native English speakers. They can offer you real-life practice and feedback. You might find language exchange groups online or in person.\n\n9. **Use Helpful Apps and Online Resources**: There are lots of tools out there designed to help with pronunciation. Look for ones that use speech recognition to give you instant feedback on how you&#x27;re doing.\n\n10. **Get to Know Phonetic Transcription**: Learning a bit about phonetic transcription, like the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), can give you a clearer idea of how to make specific sounds.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to communicate clearly, not to sound perfect.

The aim to focus on real-life applications of traditional subjects ensures that students acquire not only knowledge but also practical skills they can apply in everyday situations. Here&#x27;s how you can structure these curriculums:\n\n### Curriculum for Parents (Home-School Educators)\nThis curriculum is designed to empower parents with the tools and knowledge to facilitate their children&#x27;s learning effectively. It will include:\n\n1. **Educational Theories and Child Development**: Brief modules on how children learn at different stages, including cognitive development from ages 5 to 18. This foundation will help parents understand the &quot;why&quot; behind the curriculum activities and adapt teaching strategies to their child&#x27;s learning style.\n\n2. **Subject-Specific Teaching Strategies**:\n   - For each subject (social studies, math, science, literature, and communication), provide an overview of teaching methodologies that encourage hands-on learning and real-life application.\n   - Include tips for creating an engaging learning environment at home, fostering curiosity, and encouraging independent learning.\n\n3. **Real-Life Application of Knowledge**: Practical sessions on how to integrate knowledge with everyday life. For example, using grocery shopping as a math lesson (budgeting, calculating discounts, etc.), or a nature walk as a science lesson (identifying plants, understanding ecosystems).\n\n4. **Assessment and Feedback**: How to assess learning not just through tests, but through projects, presentations, and practical tasks. Guidance on giving constructive feedback to encourage growth.\n\n5. **Customization and Adaptation**: Tools and tips for customizing the curriculum based on the child&#x27;s interests, strengths, and areas for improvement. This section would include resources for additional learning materials and how to access them.\n\n### Curriculum for Students (Ages 5-18)\nThe student curriculum will be modular, allowing for customization based on age, interest, and skill level, focusing on functional skills and real-life applications.\n\n1. **Social Studies**: Projects and activities that involve local community engagement, understanding cultural diversity, and the practical aspects of government and economics (e.g., budget planning for a community project).\n\n2. **Math**: Math lessons focused on financial literacy (savings, budgeting, understanding interest), geometry through architecture (building a model, calculating areas), and statistics through sports or other interests.\n\n3. **Science**: Experiments and projects that solve real-world problems (e.g., designing a simple water filtration system), understanding health and nutrition through biology, and environmental conservation projects.\n\n4. **Literature**: Reading assignments that include a variety of genres, with activities aimed at critical thinking and applying lessons learned to personal experiences. Creative writing assignments that encourage students to express their thoughts and views on contemporary issues.\n\n5. **Communication**: Activities that enhance verbal and non-verbal communication, including public speaking, debate on current events, and digital literacy skills like internet research and digital content creation.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n- **Flexibility**: Both curriculums should emphasize adaptability, allowing educators and students to modify content based on learning pace, interests, and the relevance of topics.\n- **Interconnectivity**: Activities in the students&#x27; curriculum should link back to concepts covered in the parents&#x27; curriculum, ensuring a cohesive learning experience.\n- **Resources and Support**: Provide a comprehensive list of resources, including online platforms, books, and community resources, to enhance learning. Also, consider setting up a support system or forum for parents to share experiences and advice.\n\nThis dual curriculum approach not only enriches the educational experience for students but also equips parents with the confidence and resources to be effective educators."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Talk about the market and the likely customer of the project described below\n\nCreating a course that serves as an electronic textbook for homeschooling parents, especially those who might not have formal training in education, is a brilliant idea. The increasing trend towards homeschooling, combined with the diverse reasons parents choose to homeschool, presents a significant opportunity for such a resource. Many parents are looking for comprehensive, structured guidance that aligns with current educational standards and incorporates the latest in pedagogical research.Your course could fill a critical gap by providing parents with:Structured Curriculum: Outline what needs to be taught at each grade level, making sure it&#x27;s in line with current educational standards and research. This will help parents ensure they are covering necessary material.Teaching Materials: Offer ready-to-use materials that parents can employ directly in their teaching. This could include worksheets, interactive activities, and multimedia resources.Instructional Guides: Provide instructions on how to teach various concepts, which is particularly valuable for parents without a background in education. This might include strategies for engaging children, explaining complex ideas, and adapting teaching to different learning styles.Assessments and Exercises: Include exercises, quizzes, and projects to assess children&#x27;s understanding and retention of the material. Providing answer keys and grading rubrics can also help parents gauge their child\u2019s progress.Support and Community: Building a community feature into your course could provide immense value, allowing parents to share experiences, challenges, and solutions. Additionally, offering some level of direct support, whether through Q&amp;A sessions, forums, or scheduled consultations, could be a major selling point.The key to success with this type of course will be in making it as accessible and user-friendly as possible. Consider the varying levels of comfort with technology and teaching that your audience might have. Breaking down the curriculum into manageable, bite-sized pieces can make the process less daunting for parents. Moreover, focusing on interactive and practical learning activities can make education a more engaging and enjoyable experience for both the parent and the child.Given the homeschooling market&#x27;s projected growth and the clear demand for resources that support personalized, home-based learning, a course like the one you&#x27;re considering could meet an essential need. By helping parents feel more equipped and confident in providing their children with a quality education, you&#x27;d not only be offering a valuable product but also contributing positively to the homeschooling community."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "86d663f87c2c74e4-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null},

For a more advanced or larger puzzle, you would need to adjust the grid and possibly the logic to handle more complex crossword puzzle rules."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The `crosswordData` array defines the words, their starting positions, directions (across or down), and clues. The script then generates the crossword grid dynamically, placing input fields for letters in appropriate cells.\n\nEach input field is set up to only accept a single character, and the character is validated against the correct letter for that position. If the input is correct, the background of the cell turns green and the input is disabled. If incorrect, the background briefly turns red as a visual cue.\n\nThis setup provides a basic but functional crossword puzzle game focused on Italian vocabulary for April Fools&#x27; Day. You can expand upon this by adding more words, improving the styling, or enhancing the interaction further."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Let&#x27;s diagnose and propose a solution to ensure that the crossword puzzle renders correctly on the webpage:\n\n1. **JavaScript Execution Timing**: Ensure the script runs after the HTML elements it references are loaded. In your case, the script directly manipulates the DOM, so it&#x27;s crucial that the `&lt;div id=&quot;crossword&quot; class=&quot;crossword-container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` element is already parsed and available in the DOM.\n\n2. **Visibility of Input Fields**: The `.hidden` class sets the visibility to hidden for cells without letters. This is correct, but ensure that input fields for the crossword letters do not receive this class by mistake when they should display.\n\n3. **Correct Letters Assignment**: Each input field is assigned a `dataset.correct` value based on your grid. Ensure this data attribute is being set correctly for each cell that is part of a word.\n\nGiven the code snippet you provided seems logically structured and should, in theory, render the puzzle correctly, I suspect the issue might lie in how the browser is executing the JavaScript in relation to the page&#x27;s load state or perhaps a subtle oversight in how data attributes are applied or interpreted. Here&#x27;s a slightly modified approach to ensure that your script executes only after the DOM is fully loaded:\n\nWrap your script in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to ensure it runs after the HTML document has been fully loaded:\n\n```html\n&lt;script&gt;\n    document.addEventListener(&#x27;DOMContentLoaded&#x27;, function() {\n        const crosswordData = [\n            {word: &quot;SCHERZO&quot;, start: {x: 0, y: 0}, direction: &quot;across&quot;, clue: &quot;1.

This version aims to display something on the screen without the complexities of checking for correct answers. It helps in diagnosing if the problem lies within the dynamic generation of the grid or elsewhere.\n\nIf this simplified version still doesn&#x27;t display the crossword grid, check the browser&#x27;s console for errors. These errors can provide clues on what might be going wrong. Common issues include syntax errors, issues with browser compatibility, or problems with the JavaScript execution environment.\n\nIf the simplified version works, it means the structure of your HTML and basic JavaScript are functioning correctly. The issue might then be related to the logic for dynamically generating the grid based on the `crosswordData` or handling user inputs. You can then incrementally add back the more complex features, testing at each step to see where the problem might re-emerge."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

If the grid still doesn&#x27;t display as expected, there may be external factors at play, such as browser compatibility issues or external CSS/JavaScript that might be affecting the rendering. Ensure you&#x27;re testing this in a clean HTML file without any external dependencies for the most accurate troubleshooting."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Narrate the script over the video, making sure it ties together the visuals and the significance of the date.\n6. Use video editing software to assemble all these elements into a final video.\n\nI can provide a written script or describe the transitions and effects in more detail, but the actual video creation would need to be done with video editing software on your end.

Here are some common scenarios:\n\n### 1. Web Development\nFor HTML documents, you can switch stylesheets using JavaScript. While you can&#x27;t literally apply a new stylesheet with a &quot;single physical click&quot; without first writing the script that does so, once set up, changing styles can be as easy as clicking a button. Here&#x27;s a basic example:\n\n```html\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;default.css&quot; id=&quot;theme-style&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;button onclick=&quot;changeStyle(&#x27;alternate.css&#x27;)&quot;&gt;Change Style&lt;/button&gt;\n\n    &lt;script&gt;\n        function changeStyle(sheet) {\n            document.getElementById(&#x27;theme-style&#x27;).setAttribute(&#x27;href&#x27;, sheet);\n        }\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n```\n\nIn this example, clicking the button calls the `changeStyle` function, which changes the stylesheet applied to the page by altering the `href` attribute of the `&lt;link&gt;` tag with the `id` of &quot;theme-style&quot;.\n\n### 2. Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs)\nMost modern word processing software allows for the application of pre-defined styles or templates, which can change the look of a document instantly. However, applying these with a &quot;single click&quot; typically means having a toolbar or menu open from which you can select your new style. For example, in Google Docs:\n\n- You can create or import a set of styles.\n- Use the `Styles` menu to select your desired style, which is then applied to the document.\n\n### 3. Text Editors and IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)\nFor coding projects or plain text documents, many text editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) support extensions or plugins that allow quick switching between different syntax highlighting themes or styles. Once a theme is installed, switching between themes can often be done with just a few clicks or a keyboard shortcut.\n\n### 4. CSS Preprocessors (Sass, Less)\nFor more advanced web development projects, CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less can make it easier to manage styles. They allow you to define variables, functions, and mixins that can be reused across stylesheets. While this approach doesn&#x27;t apply a stylesheet with a click, it significantly simplifies the process of changing styles across a site by altering a few variables.\n\nIn each case, the precise method to &quot;one-click apply&quot; a style sheet will depend on the tools and platforms you&#x27;re using."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This functionality is often found in online resume builders and word processing software, where templates act as style sheets. Here&#x27;s how it works in common scenarios:\n\n### Online Resume Builders:\nMany online resume builders allow you to apply different templates to your resume content with a single click. Once you&#x27;ve entered your information into the builder&#x27;s interface, you can usually preview and apply different styles or templates from their collection. This changes the appearance of your resume instantly without altering the content. Websites like LinkedIn, Canva, and Zety offer such features.\n\n### Microsoft Word or Google Docs:\nIf you&#x27;re using a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, the concept is similar but slightly less dynamic:\n\n- **Microsoft Word**: You can create different styles for headings, body text, etc., and save these styles as a template. You can also download resume templates where the styles are predefined. Applying a template to an existing document might require copying the content into the new template file.\n- **Google Docs**: Similar to Microsoft Word, Google Docs offers various templates. You can open a template and paste your resume content into it, effectively applying the template&#x27;s style to your content with a few clicks.\n\n### LaTeX:\nFor academic and technical resumes, LaTeX is a popular tool that separates content from style. You define your resume content once and can apply different LaTeX resume templates (style sheets) to this content. Changing the template can dramatically alter the appearance of the resume. This process might involve a bit more than one click but is highly effective for applying different styles.\n\n### Design Software:\nIf your resume is more design-oriented, software like Adobe InDesign allows you to create and apply master pages (templates) that define styles for various elements of your document. While applying a new master page or template might require a few clicks, it&#x27;s a powerful way to change the look of your resume.\n\nIn each of these scenarios, the key is having your content separated from the formatting so you can quickly apply new formats or styles without having to redo your resume each time. This approach saves time and allows you to customize your resume for different applications easily."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The top reason for homeschooling is a concern about school environment.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (IES) homeschooling facts, the top reason for homeschooling is a concern about school environment, such as safety, drugs, and negative peer pressure. (4)\n\nReasons for Homeschooling Percentage   \nSafe environment concerns 25% of parents   \nBad academic quality 14.5% of parents   \nTo provide religious instruction 13% of parents   \nTo provide moral instruction 6.6% of parents   \nHealth problems 3.6% of parents\u00a0  \nSpecial needs 7.3% of parents   \nTo provide nontraditional education 7.7% of parents   \nEmphasis on family 8.3% of parents   \nOther reasons 14% of parents  \n\nThe second most popular reason was dissatisfaction with the academic instruction at schools, followed by a desire to provide religious instruction.\n\nBut not all parents want to homeschool their children.\u00a0\n\nAccording to EdChoice statistics against homeschooling, socialization is the most common reason why parents have not yet homeschooled their children. (5)\n\nReasons Not to Homeschool Percentage   \nChild will not be prepared socially for real-life 16% of parents   \nCoordinating with work schedule 15% of parents   \nTime management 14% of parents   \nNote sure if realistically doable 13% of parents   \nDon\u2019t want to disrupt child\u2019s relationships 12% of parents   \nDon\u2019t want to disrupt child\u2019s current schooling 12% of parents   \nOther reasons 18% of parents  \n\nThe second most common reason not to homeschool is the problem with coordinating homeschool with work schedule followed by time management.\n\n### 4. Homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschooling success statistics, 78% of peer-reviewed studies on academic achievements show that homeschool students perform statistically significantly better than students in institutional schools. (6)\n\nHere are some brief summaries of studies on homeschooling.\n\nAuthor(s)Results of the Studies   \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2013, 2017 Homeschooled score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.  \nRay, 2015 Black homeschool students scored 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students.  \nMartin-Chang et al., 2011 Researchers found that children from structured homeschool settings outperformed their conventional school peers (by 0.06 to 0.15 effect sizes).  \nRudner, 1999 Median scores for home school students fell between the 70th and 80th percentile. The study concluded that those parents choosing to make a commitment to homeschooling are able to provide a very successful academic environment.  \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2017 Home-educated students typically score above average on the college admission SAT and ACT tests.  \nCogan, 2010 College students who were homeschooled earn higher first-year and fourth-year GPAs when controlling for demographic, pre-college, engagement, and first-term academic factors.  \n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed research papers on homeschooling found a positive effect of homeschooling compared to institutional schooling. The same positive outcomes were also revealed regarding social and emotional development. (6)\n\nThe positive effect was real and measurable also for homeschooled students who later became adults compared to those who had been in conventional schools.\n\n### 5. The highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) latest homeschooled kids statistics, the highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8. (7)\n\nGrade Equivalent Homeschooled   \n2019 Homeschooled   \n2016 Homeschooled   \n2012   \nKindergarten 8%11%12%  \nGrades 1 to 3 22%18%20%  \nGrades 4 to 5 18%17%15%  \nGrades 6 to 8 29%24%24%  \nGrades 9 to 12 22%31%29%  \n\nInterestingly enough, the dominant grade equivalent of 6-8 has shifted from grades 9-12 since 2012. (7)\n\nOverall, the grade distribution is roughly even across all grade levels above kindergarten.\n\n### 6. 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) homeschool demographics data, a surprising 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.

The study concluded that those parents choosing to make a commitment to homeschooling are able to provide a very successful academic environment.  \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2017 Home-educated students typically score above average on the college admission SAT and ACT tests.  \nCogan, 2010 College students who were homeschooled earn higher first-year and fourth-year GPAs when controlling for demographic, pre-college, engagement, and first-term academic factors.  \n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed research papers on homeschooling found a positive effect of homeschooling compared to institutional schooling.

Today, more and more parents are choosing to \u301041\u2020educate their children at home\u3011, fueling the rise of homeschooling in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a new \u301042\u2020joint analysis\u2020news.stanford.edu\u3011 by the Associated Press and researchers from Stanford University, a whopping 1.2 million K-12 schoolchildren remain missing from public schools since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit in 2020. The study, which examined 22 jurisdictions, found that roughly 26% of these students switched to homeschooling. The question is, what is leading to this rise in homeschooling?\n\nThe beginning of the pandemic was a scary, uncertain time. According to U.S. Census Bureau reporting, many parents wanted to keep their children at home, not just to ensure social distancing but also to meet their socio-emotional needs. The Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found that from April to October 2020, the number of households with school-age children reporting them as homeschooled rose from 5.4% to 11.1%. Now that the pandemic\u2019s various closures are over in the U.S., it\u2019s clear these sentiments are persisting; many parents no longer trust the public school system. Thanks to \u301043\u2020underfunded schools\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and crowded classrooms, many parents believe their children are no longer getting the attention they deserve. This is especially true for students who need \u301044\u2020special care\u2020apnews.com\u3011 and attention. At home, though, parents hypothetically can control all of these various needs in a personalized way.\n\nHow are educators responding to this rise in homeschooling across the U.S.? Educator and philanthropist \u301045\u2020Diane Lewis\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, who founded \u301046\u2020Firefly Tutors\u2020www.fireflytutors.com\u3011 two years ago with the aim to impart high-quality yet affordable education to her students, had this to say.\n\n### Diane\u2019s Thoughts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend of parents choosing to homeschool in the US. Nearly 7% of parents homeschool one or more of their children. In California, where I reside, it\u2019s more than 9%, and numbers are rising. Why?\n\nDue to a variety of reasons, parents are bridging the gaps in education for their children. A child may not be receiving adequate instruction at a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn\u2019t mean that the teachers are terrible or that the schools are bad! Unfortunately, our education system needs reform to better fund and serve students with special needs, those that are gifted, and those with unique learning differences.\n\nMany great private schools offer specialized learning programs, but most parents can\u2019t afford the tuition. Homeschool offers a simple, affordable alternative for parents who want customized learning. Each student is unique. Homeschooling allows for targeted blends of sensory integration into the learning process, which promotes greater comprehension and retention that helps each student to reach their highest potential.\u201d\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest updates in B2B!\n\n\u301047\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \u301048\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020 \u2020company.marketscale.com\u3011 \n\n### Latest\n\n\u301051\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301051\u2020Revolutionize Truck Driver Engagement in Logistics: Integrate Texting and Social Media for Stronger Relationships and Increased Efficiency\u3011 \n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe logistics and supply chain sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need for more efficient communication channels between companies and frontline workers, particularly truck drivers.

Today, more and more parents are choosing to \u301041\u2020educate their children at home\u3011, fueling the rise of homeschooling in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a new \u301042\u2020joint analysis\u2020news.stanford.edu\u3011 by the Associated Press and researchers from Stanford University, a whopping 1.2 million K-12 schoolchildren remain missing from public schools since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit in 2020. The study, which examined 22 jurisdictions, found that roughly 26% of these students switched to homeschooling. The question is, what is leading to this rise in homeschooling?\n\nThe beginning of the pandemic was a scary, uncertain time. According to U.S. Census Bureau reporting, many parents wanted to keep their children at home, not just to ensure social distancing but also to meet their socio-emotional needs. The Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found that from April to October 2020, the number of households with school-age children reporting them as homeschooled rose from 5.4% to 11.1%. Now that the pandemic\u2019s various closures are over in the U.S., it\u2019s clear these sentiments are persisting; many parents no longer trust the public school system. Thanks to \u301043\u2020underfunded schools\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and crowded classrooms, many parents believe their children are no longer getting the attention they deserve. This is especially true for students who need \u301044\u2020special care\u2020apnews.com\u3011 and attention. At home, though, parents hypothetically can control all of these various needs in a personalized way.\n\nHow are educators responding to this rise in homeschooling across the U.S.? Educator and philanthropist \u301045\u2020Diane Lewis\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, who founded \u301046\u2020Firefly Tutors\u2020www.fireflytutors.com\u3011 two years ago with the aim to impart high-quality yet affordable education to her students, had this to say.\n\n### Diane\u2019s Thoughts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend of parents choosing to homeschool in the US. Nearly 7% of parents homeschool one or more of their children. In California, where I reside, it\u2019s more than 9%, and numbers are rising. Why?\n\nDue to a variety of reasons, parents are bridging the gaps in education for their children. A child may not be receiving adequate instruction at a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn\u2019t mean that the teachers are terrible or that the schools are bad! Unfortunately, our education system needs reform to better fund and serve students with special needs, those that are gifted, and those with unique learning differences.\n\nMany great private schools offer specialized learning programs, but most parents can\u2019t afford the tuition. Homeschool offers a simple, affordable alternative for parents who want customized learning. Each student is unique. Homeschooling allows for targeted blends of sensory integration into the learning process, which promotes greater comprehension and retention that helps each student to reach their highest potential.\u201d\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest updates in B2B!\n\n\u301047\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \u301048\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020 \u2020company.marketscale.com\u3011 \n\n### Latest\n\n\u301051\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301051\u2020Revolutionize Truck Driver Engagement in Logistics: Integrate Texting and Social Media for Stronger Relationships and Increased Efficiency\u3011 \n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe logistics and supply chain sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need for more efficient communication channels between companies and frontline workers, particularly truck drivers.

The homeschooling market is expanding, driven by various factors including concerns over school environments, a desire for personalized instruction, and dissatisfaction with traditional schooling methods. The homeschooling sector in the United States alone has seen a compound annual growth rate of 9.8% from 2019 to 2029, with projections indicating the market could reach USD 10.14 billion by 2029\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\nA considerable portion of this growth stems from parents&#x27; concerns over school safety, academic quality, and the desire to provide religious or moral instruction, among other reasons. Additionally, there&#x27;s a high level of interest in homeschooling for middle school-aged students (grades 6 to 8), which represents the highest rate of homeschooling among all grade levels. It&#x27;s also notable that a significant portion of homeschooling households have three or more children, and many of these households fall into higher income brackets\u30105\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThe shift towards homeschooling has been further fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many parents continuing to choose homeschooling due to dissatisfaction with the public school system and a desire for a more tailored educational experience for their children. This trend is supported by a variety of educational resources and platforms, with a wide range of teaching methods such as the Classical Method, Charlotte Mason Method, Montessori Method, and Unit Studies being popular among homeschooling families\u30107\u2020source\u3011\u30106\u2020source\u3011.\n\nGiven these insights, creating courses that cater to the diverse needs of homeschooling families can be quite promising. Course creators should consider developing curriculums that are adaptable to different teaching methods, offer personalized learning experiences, and cater to a wide range of subjects across various grade levels. Additionally, focusing on subjects where parents feel less confident in teaching, such as advanced science or math, could fulfill an important niche in the homeschooling market. \n\nWith the growing prevalence of online homeschooling platforms and the continuous search for high-quality educational content, there&#x27;s a significant opportunity to contribute to this expanding market by offering courses that address these needs and preferences."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.  \nRay, 2015 Black homeschool students scored 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students.  \nMartin-Chang et al., 2011 Researchers found that children from structured homeschool settings outperformed their conventional school peers (by 0.06 to 0.15 effect sizes).  \nRudner, 1999 Median scores for home school students fell between the 70th and 80th percentile. The study concluded that those parents choosing to make a commitment to homeschooling are able to provide a very successful academic environment.  \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2017 Home-educated students typically score above average on the college admission SAT and ACT tests.  \nCogan, 2010 College students who were homeschooled earn higher first-year and fourth-year GPAs when controlling for demographic, pre-college, engagement, and first-term academic factors.  \n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed research papers on homeschooling found a positive effect of homeschooling compared to institutional schooling.

Today, more and more parents are choosing to \u301041\u2020educate their children at home\u3011, fueling the rise of homeschooling in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a new \u301042\u2020joint analysis\u2020news.stanford.edu\u3011 by the Associated Press and researchers from Stanford University, a whopping 1.2 million K-12 schoolchildren remain missing from public schools since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit in 2020. The study, which examined 22 jurisdictions, found that roughly 26% of these students switched to homeschooling. The question is, what is leading to this rise in homeschooling?\n\nThe beginning of the pandemic was a scary, uncertain time. According to U.S. Census Bureau reporting, many parents wanted to keep their children at home, not just to ensure social distancing but also to meet their socio-emotional needs. The Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found that from April to October 2020, the number of households with school-age children reporting them as homeschooled rose from 5.4% to 11.1%. Now that the pandemic\u2019s various closures are over in the U.S., it\u2019s clear these sentiments are persisting; many parents no longer trust the public school system. Thanks to \u301043\u2020underfunded schools\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and crowded classrooms, many parents believe their children are no longer getting the attention they deserve. This is especially true for students who need \u301044\u2020special care\u2020apnews.com\u3011 and attention. At home, though, parents hypothetically can control all of these various needs in a personalized way.\n\nHow are educators responding to this rise in homeschooling across the U.S.? Educator and philanthropist \u301045\u2020Diane Lewis\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, who founded \u301046\u2020Firefly Tutors\u2020www.fireflytutors.com\u3011 two years ago with the aim to impart high-quality yet affordable education to her students, had this to say.\n\n### Diane\u2019s Thoughts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend of parents choosing to homeschool in the US. Nearly 7% of parents homeschool one or more of their children. In California, where I reside, it\u2019s more than 9%, and numbers are rising. Why?\n\nDue to a variety of reasons, parents are bridging the gaps in education for their children. A child may not be receiving adequate instruction at a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn\u2019t mean that the teachers are terrible or that the schools are bad! Unfortunately, our education system needs reform to better fund and serve students with special needs, those that are gifted, and those with unique learning differences.\n\nMany great private schools offer specialized learning programs, but most parents can\u2019t afford the tuition. Homeschool offers a simple, affordable alternative for parents who want customized learning. Each student is unique. Homeschooling allows for targeted blends of sensory integration into the learning process, which promotes greater comprehension and retention that helps each student to reach their highest potential.\u201d\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest updates in B2B!\n\n\u301047\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \u301048\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020 \u2020company.marketscale.com\u3011 \n\n### Latest\n\n\u301051\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301051\u2020Revolutionize Truck Driver Engagement in Logistics: Integrate Texting and Social Media for Stronger Relationships and Increased Efficiency\u3011 \n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe logistics and supply chain sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need for more efficient communication channels between companies and frontline workers, particularly truck drivers.

The top reason for homeschooling is a concern about school environment.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (IES) homeschooling facts, the top reason for homeschooling is a concern about school environment, such as safety, drugs, and negative peer pressure.

(5)\n\nReasons Not to Homeschool Percentage   \nChild will not be prepared socially for real-life 16% of parents   \nCoordinating with work schedule 15% of parents   \nTime management 14% of parents   \nNote sure if realistically doable 13% of parents   \nDon\u2019t want to disrupt child\u2019s relationships 12% of parents   \nDon\u2019t want to disrupt child\u2019s current schooling 12% of parents   \nOther reasons 18% of parents  \n\nThe second most common reason not to homeschool is the problem with coordinating homeschool with work schedule followed by time management.\n\n### 4. Homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschooling success statistics, 78% of peer-reviewed studies on academic achievements show that homeschool students perform statistically significantly better than students in institutional schools. (6)\n\nHere are some brief summaries of studies on homeschooling.\n\nAuthor(s)Results of the Studies   \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2013, 2017 Homeschooled score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.  \nRay, 2015 Black homeschool students scored 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students.  \nMartin-Chang et al., 2011 Researchers found that children from structured homeschool settings outperformed their conventional school peers (by 0.06 to 0.15 effect sizes).  \nRudner, 1999 Median scores for home school students fell between the 70th and 80th percentile. The study concluded that those parents choosing to make a commitment to homeschooling are able to provide a very successful academic environment.  \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2017 Home-educated students typically score above average on the college admission SAT and ACT tests.  \nCogan, 2010 College students who were homeschooled earn higher first-year and fourth-year GPAs when controlling for demographic, pre-college, engagement, and first-term academic factors.  \n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed research papers on homeschooling found a positive effect of homeschooling compared to institutional schooling. The same positive outcomes were also revealed regarding social and emotional development. (6)\n\nThe positive effect was real and measurable also for homeschooled students who later became adults compared to those who had been in conventional schools.\n\n### 5. The highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) latest homeschooled kids statistics, the highest homeschooling rate is among students with a grade equivalent of 6 to 8.

(7)\n\nOverall, the grade distribution is roughly even across all grade levels above kindergarten.\n\n### 6. 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) homeschool demographics data, a surprising 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children. (7)\n\n3+ Children 2 Children 1 Child   \n48% of households 33% of households 19% of households  \n\nInterestingly enough, the homeschool data shows that only 19% of homeschooling households have 1 child and 33% have 2 children.\n\nOne can argue anecdotally, that in a household with three or more children, there\u2019s already a significantly higher focus on kids. So perhaps it can be easier to homeschool all of them together.\n\nWhite Black Hispanic Asian Other   \n70%6%17%2%6%  \n\nThe NCES data also shows that 7 in 10 homeschool students are white. (7)\n\nThe second most common ethnicity of homeschooled children is Hispanic, followed by Black, Asian, and other ethnicities.\u00a0\n\n2 Parents 1 Parent Non-parental   \n83% of homeschoolers 14% of homeschoolers 3% of homeschoolers  \n\nAccording to NCES homeschool families data, 83% of homeschool students live in two-parent households, followed by 14% in 1 parent, and 3% in non-parental households.

Homeschool students outperform institutional school students academically.\n\nAccording to National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) homeschooling success statistics, 78% of peer-reviewed studies on academic achievements show that homeschool students perform statistically significantly better than students in institutional schools. (6)\n\nHere are some brief summaries of studies on homeschooling.\n\nAuthor(s)Results of the Studies   \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2013, 2017 Homeschooled score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests. The public school average is the 50th percentile; scores range from 1 to 99.  \nRay, 2015 Black homeschool students scored 23 to 42 percentile points above Black public school students.  \nMartin-Chang et al., 2011 Researchers found that children from structured homeschool settings outperformed their conventional school peers (by 0.06 to 0.15 effect sizes).  \nRudner, 1999 Median scores for home school students fell between the 70th and 80th percentile. The study concluded that those parents choosing to make a commitment to homeschooling are able to provide a very successful academic environment.  \nMurphy, 2012; Ray, 2017 Home-educated students typically score above average on the college admission SAT and ACT tests.  \nCogan, 2010 College students who were homeschooled earn higher first-year and fourth-year GPAs when controlling for demographic, pre-college, engagement, and first-term academic factors.  \n\nThe majority of peer-reviewed research papers on homeschooling found a positive effect of homeschooling compared to institutional schooling. The same positive outcomes were also revealed regarding social and emotional development. (6)\n\nThe positive effect was real and measurable also for homeschooled students who later became adults compared to those who had been in conventional schools.\n\n### 5.

(7)\n\nOverall, the grade distribution is roughly even across all grade levels above kindergarten.\n\n### 6. 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children.\n\nAccording to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) homeschool demographics data, a surprising 48% of homeschooling households have three or more children. (7)\n\n3+ Children 2 Children 1 Child   \n48% of households 33% of households 19% of households  \n\nInterestingly enough, the homeschool data shows that only 19% of homeschooling households have 1 child and 33% have 2 children.\n\nOne can argue anecdotally, that in a household with three or more children, there\u2019s already a significantly higher focus on kids. So perhaps it can be easier to homeschool all of them together.\n\nWhite Black Hispanic Asian Other   \n70%6%17%2%6%  \n\nThe NCES data also shows that 7 in 10 homeschool students are white.

Today, more and more parents are choosing to \u301041\u2020educate their children at home\u3011, fueling the rise of homeschooling in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a new \u301042\u2020joint analysis\u2020news.stanford.edu\u3011 by the Associated Press and researchers from Stanford University, a whopping 1.2 million K-12 schoolchildren remain missing from public schools since the COVID-19 pandemic first hit in 2020. The study, which examined 22 jurisdictions, found that roughly 26% of these students switched to homeschooling. The question is, what is leading to this rise in homeschooling?\n\nThe beginning of the pandemic was a scary, uncertain time. According to U.S. Census Bureau reporting, many parents wanted to keep their children at home, not just to ensure social distancing but also to meet their socio-emotional needs. The Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey found that from April to October 2020, the number of households with school-age children reporting them as homeschooled rose from 5.4% to 11.1%. Now that the pandemic\u2019s various closures are over in the U.S., it\u2019s clear these sentiments are persisting; many parents no longer trust the public school system. Thanks to \u301043\u2020underfunded schools\u2020www.theguardian.com\u3011 and crowded classrooms, many parents believe their children are no longer getting the attention they deserve. This is especially true for students who need \u301044\u2020special care\u2020apnews.com\u3011 and attention. At home, though, parents hypothetically can control all of these various needs in a personalized way.\n\nHow are educators responding to this rise in homeschooling across the U.S.? Educator and philanthropist \u301045\u2020Diane Lewis\u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011, who founded \u301046\u2020Firefly Tutors\u2020www.fireflytutors.com\u3011 two years ago with the aim to impart high-quality yet affordable education to her students, had this to say.\n\n### Diane\u2019s Thoughts\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend of parents choosing to homeschool in the US. Nearly 7% of parents homeschool one or more of their children. In California, where I reside, it\u2019s more than 9%, and numbers are rising. Why?\n\nDue to a variety of reasons, parents are bridging the gaps in education for their children. A child may not be receiving adequate instruction at a brick-and-mortar school. This doesn\u2019t mean that the teachers are terrible or that the schools are bad! Unfortunately, our education system needs reform to better fund and serve students with special needs, those that are gifted, and those with unique learning differences.\n\nMany great private schools offer specialized learning programs, but most parents can\u2019t afford the tuition. Homeschool offers a simple, affordable alternative for parents who want customized learning. Each student is unique. Homeschooling allows for targeted blends of sensory integration into the learning process, which promotes greater comprehension and retention that helps each student to reach their highest potential.\u201d\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest updates in B2B!\n\n\u301047\u2020 \u2020www.linkedin.com\u3011 \u301048\u2020 \u2020twitter.com\u3011 \u301049\u2020 \u2020www.instagram.com\u3011 \n\n\u301050\u2020 \u2020company.marketscale.com\u3011 \n\n### Latest\n\n\u301051\u2020 \u3011 \n\n#####  \u301051\u2020Revolutionize Truck Driver Engagement in Logistics: Integrate Texting and Social Media for Stronger Relationships and Increased Efficiency\u3011 \n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe logistics and supply chain sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the need for more efficient communication channels between companies and frontline workers, particularly truck drivers.

Thinkific is a popular platform for creating and selling online courses, known for its user-friendly interface, comprehensive course creation tools, and robust support for creators. It allows educators to design courses with various multimedia elements, including videos, quizzes, surveys, and downloadable resources, which can be structured into modules and lessons to create a cohesive learning experience.\n\nFor homeschooling courses, a platform like Thinkific could be a great match due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Flexibility and Customization**: Thinkific allows course creators to tailor their content to different learning styles and educational needs, which is crucial for homeschooling. Courses can be customized to suit various homeschooling methods, grade levels, and subjects.\n\n2. **Interactive Learning**: The platform supports interactive features such as quizzes, discussions, and assignments, enhancing engagement and making it easier for homeschooling parents to track their children\u2019s progress and understanding.\n\n3. **Accessibility and Convenience**: Courses on Thinkific can be accessed anytime, anywhere, which is ideal for the flexible schedules often associated with homeschooling. This allows parents to incorporate education into daily life in a way that suits their family\u2019s routine.\n\n4. **Resource Sharing**: Thinkific courses can include downloadable materials, further supporting homeschooling efforts. Parents can access a wide range of resources to supplement their children&#x27;s learning.\n\n5. **Community Building**: The platform can foster a sense of community among course participants through discussion forums and interactions. This can be especially valuable in the homeschooling context, where parents and students might be looking for opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals.\n\n6. **Monetization and Scalability**: For educators and content creators, Thinkific provides tools for monetizing their courses and reaching a wider audience, making it a potentially profitable venture to create homeschooling content.\n\nWhile Thinkific appears to be a suitable platform for hosting homeschooling courses, the effectiveness and suitability would ultimately depend on the specific content, target audience, and how the course is marketed and managed. It&#x27;s also worth considering the needs and preferences of the homeschooling community you aim to serve, as well as comparing features and costs with other online course platforms to find the best fit."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The increasing trend towards homeschooling, combined with the diverse reasons parents choose to homeschool, presents a significant opportunity for such a resource. Many parents are looking for comprehensive, structured guidance that aligns with current educational standards and incorporates the latest in pedagogical research.\n\nYour course could fill a critical gap by providing parents with:\n\n- **Structured Curriculum**: Outline what needs to be taught at each grade level, making sure it&#x27;s in line with current educational standards and research. This will help parents ensure they are covering necessary material.\n\n- **Teaching Materials**: Offer ready-to-use materials that parents can employ directly in their teaching. This could include worksheets, interactive activities, and multimedia resources.\n\n- **Instructional Guides**: Provide instructions on how to teach various concepts, which is particularly valuable for parents without a background in education. This might include strategies for engaging children, explaining complex ideas, and adapting teaching to different learning styles.\n\n- **Assessments and Exercises**: Include exercises, quizzes, and projects to assess children&#x27;s understanding and retention of the material. Providing answer keys and grading rubrics can also help parents gauge their child\u2019s progress.\n\n- **Support and Community**: Building a community feature into your course could provide immense value, allowing parents to share experiences, challenges, and solutions. Additionally, offering some level of direct support, whether through Q&amp;A sessions, forums, or scheduled consultations, could be a major selling point.\n\nThe key to success with this type of course will be in making it as accessible and user-friendly as possible. Consider the varying levels of comfort with technology and teaching that your audience might have. Breaking down the curriculum into manageable, bite-sized pieces can make the process less daunting for parents. Moreover, focusing on interactive and practical learning activities can make education a more engaging and enjoyable experience for both the parent and the child.\n\nGiven the homeschooling market&#x27;s projected growth and the clear demand for resources that support personalized, home-based learning, a course like the one you&#x27;re considering could meet an essential need. By helping parents feel more equipped and confident in providing their children with a quality education, you&#x27;d not only be offering a valuable product but also contributing positively to the homeschooling community."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The program is free upfront and our customers pay us back when they\u2019re hired.\n\nBuilt around aligned incentives, we help build equity in the job search process by providing 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and a platform to uplift job seekers and ultimately, help them fulfill their hopes, ambitions, and livelihoods. We\u2019ve already helped more than a thousand fellows land meaningful jobs, and helped them earn over $100M in salary.\n\nIn 2022 we raised our Series B and there is even more exciting growth on the horizon. That year we expanded from 6 to 14 industries, launched a tiered pricing system with differentiated product offerings, and much more.\n\nOur Mission \ud83d\ude80\nOur mission is to help people everywhere build their careers by being the world\u2019s best career agency. \n\nWe believe the job search system is broken and can be fixed with a business model that acts on behalf of the job seeker, instead of on behalf of employers, recruiters, or schools. If this sounds interesting to you, we look forward to hearing from you!\n\nRead more about our mission in our manifesto.\n\nThe Role\nThe Career Mentor team is the fastest growing team at Pathrise.

Commission is uncapped.\n\nPerformance bonuses and/or raises are evaluated annually for team members who meet the expectations for their role.\nOur culture\n\ud83d\udc4b We are a tight-knit community that champions for our staff to bring their authentic true selves to work and aim to provide a fun and collaborative work environment for everyone. Although we are remote we have many virtual and company sponsored in-person events. We also value diversity - our Career team is made up of mentors from a variety of different backgrounds and identities, and exemplifies what Pathrise stands for externally as well as internally. Read more about how we aim to create a diverse and inclusive environment: What DE&amp;I means to Pathrise \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd0e\n\nOur interview process\n- Phone chat with a recruiter \n- HackerRank assessment - no coding involved.

Think &quot;technical test&quot;, but for a career coach instead of an engineer.\n- Mock career coaching round\n- Final virtual &quot;onsite&quot;, which is a mixture of behavioral interview panels\n- Reference checks\n\nThis role is remote within the US only, and is not currently available to applicants located outside of the US. US work authorization is required.\n\n\ud83d\udca1The Pathrise Approach to Hiring\n\nAt Pathrise we have a unique understanding of the hiring process from the perspective of companies and candidates, and the ups and downs that come with it. Candidates are close to our hearts - we&#x27;ve been them, we coach them, we know them.\n\nOur general full-time hiring process outlined below. Note: this doesn&#x27;t apply to part-time roles which consist of an intro call + a 30-45 min final interview.\n\nApplication Stage\n- Our recruiting team reviews applications and responds to qualified applicants as quickly as possible.\n- Our ATS does not auto-reject in any way\n- Note that some part-time roles are listed in &quot;Inactive - Resume Pool&quot; status, meaning hiring happens on a rolling basis and may open unexpectedly.\n\nIntro Call\n- In this 30 minute phone call, we aim to align on the role and answer your questions to ensure a mutual fit\n- Taking the next step in your career is a big deal! Ask whatever questions you need to ensure we&#x27;re the right fit for you.\n- Candidates who advance will be provided with a helpful guide to support their candidate experience.\n\nSkill Assessment or Hiring Manager Interview\n- For some roles, this is a 30 minute Google Meet interview with a hiring manager.\n- For other roles, this stage is a hands-on skill assessment that gives you a firsthand glimpse of what basic skills are needed to execute in this role, and how they&#x27;ll be applied. It also gives us early signals on the more technical aspects of candidate fit.\n\nVirtual Onsite (full-time roles only)\n- Candidates will meet with hiring managers and collaborators for further skill assessments and behavioral interviews.\n- Because this stage can take considerable time for all candidates and interviewers (1.5 - 3 hours), we are very intentional about how we conduct it and who we move forward. We do our best to be mindful of time commitments and candidate efforts, and will communicate if things change unexpectedly.\n- You&#x27;ll receive guidance well in advance.\n\nReference Interviews (full-time roles only)\n- We&#x27;ll ask for some professional references to follow up with.\n\n\nPathrise is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that proudly pursues and hires a diverse workforce.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown to consider:\n\n### Tabloid-sized (11&quot;x17&quot;) PDF Resume:\n- **Pros:**\n  - More space for creativity and to display your work, especially if your profession involves graphic design, architecture, or other visual arts.\n  - Can make a bold statement and stand out from other candidates.\n  - Suitable for including samples of your work directly on your resume if they&#x27;re visual.\n\n- **Cons:**\n  - Not the standard size, so it might not be as easily accepted by all hiring systems or managers.\n  - Could be viewed as impractical or too unconventional for some industries.\n  - Harder to print and handle for the employer, which might be an inconvenience.\n\n### Standard Letter-sized (8.5&quot;x11&quot;) PDF Resume:\n- **Pros:**\n  - Widely accepted and expected size for resumes in most professional fields.\n  - Easier for hiring managers to print, file, and handle.\n  - More likely to be compatible with applicant tracking systems (ATS) that many companies use.\n\n- **Cons:**\n  - Less space for creative layouts and visual elements.\n  - Might blend in with other resumes if not well-designed.\n\n### Decision Factors:\n1. **Industry Norms:** If you&#x27;re applying for a role in a creative field, the tabloid size could showcase your design skills and originality effectively. For more traditional fields, stick with the letter size.\n   \n2. **Content vs. Design:** Consider whether the additional space in the tabloid size genuinely enhances the presentation of your qualifications or if it&#x27;s just for aesthetics. The letter size may be sufficient if your resume is content-heavy without the need for large visual elements.\n\n3. **Practicality and Accessibility:** Remember that your resume should be easily accessible and readable by the employer. If the larger size complicates these factors, it might not be the best choice.\n\nGiven your career as a Career Mentor, which likely emphasizes content over extensive design elements, a standard letter-sized resume might be more appropriate and universally accepted, ensuring it can be easily handled and reviewed by any prospective employer. However, if you&#x27;re applying to a role that values innovation and uniqueness highly, and you believe the tabloid-sized resume significantly adds to your presentation, it could be worth using for those specific applications."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Focus on experiences that showcase skills and achievements related to the role you want.\n\n2. **Length of your resume:** If your resume extends beyond two pages, it might be time to trim older or less relevant positions, especially if they don&#x27;t add value to your current job application.\n\n3. **Career progression:** If older jobs demonstrate your career progression or provide context for your career journey, they might be worth keeping. However, if newer roles more effectively show your qualifications, earlier roles might be less necessary.\n\n4. **Time frame:** Generally, it&#x27;s acceptable to list the last 10-15 years of your work history. Jobs beyond this range can be left off unless they are particularly important for the position you&#x27;re applying for.\n\n5. **Gaps in employment:** If removing older jobs creates large gaps in your employment history, you may need to address these gaps either in your resume or cover letter.\n\n6. **Changing career fields:** If you&#x27;re changing careers, focus on transferable skills and relevant experiences that align with the new field, even if it means omitting earlier roles that are less relevant.\n\nRemember, your resume is a tool to get you an interview. It should highlight your most pertinent experiences, skills, and achievements. Tailor your resume for each application, focusing on what&#x27;s most relevant to the specific job and company. If certain aspects of your work history don&#x27;t support your current job objectives, it may be wise to leave them off to maintain clarity and conciseness."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are a few reasons why you might consider leaving off some of your work history:\n\n1. **Relevance**: Focus on experience that directly relates to the job you&#x27;re applying for. Highlighting roles that demonstrate your skills and accomplishments in areas pertinent to the position can make your application more compelling.\n\n2. **Length**: Ideally, a resume should be one to two pages long, depending on your experience level. Too much information can overwhelm the reader and dilute the impact of your key achievements.\n\n3. **Recency**: Older positions, especially those beyond 10-15 years, might not be as relevant to your current career goals or the technologies and practices of your industry today.\n\n4. **Overqualification**: In some cases, listing very senior or advanced roles might make you seem overqualified for the positions you&#x27;re applying for, potentially leading employers to assume you won&#x27;t be satisfied with the role or salary.\n\n5. **Career Narrative**: Your resume should tell a coherent story of your professional journey. If earlier roles don&#x27;t contribute to this narrative or seem disconnected from your current path, it might be better to leave them off.\n\nFor the Membership Coordinator role at Coaching.com, focus on experiences that highlight your project management skills, ability to work remotely, experience with customer relationship management, and any direct experience you have in community engagement or membership coordination. Tailoring your resume in this way can make it more targeted, readable, and effective in showcasing your qualifications for the specific role you&#x27;re pursuing."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It&#x27;s a unique way to adapt the mirror test concept to a digital context. However, it&#x27;s important to clarify a few things:\n\n1. **Recognition and Understanding**: When AI, like me, &quot;recognizes&quot; something from an image or a piece of text, it&#x27;s not recognition in the human sense. It&#x27;s pattern matching based on data and algorithms. If I &quot;recognized&quot; a screenshot of a conversation as being a chat with an instance of ChatGPT, it would be because certain textual elements in the screenshot matched patterns the AI was trained to identify.\n\n2. **Self-awareness**: Despite being able to identify elements of a chat interface or certain text patterns, AI lacks self-awareness. AI does not possess consciousness or an understanding of self in the way humans do. Recognizing text in a screenshot as a chat session doesn&#x27;t equate to self-recognition or self-awareness\u2014it&#x27;s simply data processing.\n\n3. **Instances**: Your understanding aligns with how instances are often described in programming and computing. Each interaction with an AI like me can be seen as interacting with a separate &quot;instance.&quot; There&#x27;s no continuous memory or awareness between different sessions or instances. Each time you start a new conversation, it&#x27;s like starting with a fresh version, although all instances draw from the same trained model and data.\n\nThe experiment you mentioned reflects more about the AI&#x27;s capability to analyze and describe images or text based on its training, rather than passing the mirror test in the traditional sense of self-awareness. It&#x27;s a neat reflection of how AI tools can process and analyze information, but it doesn&#x27;t signify consciousness or self-recognition. AI, including me, remains a tool created and improved by humans, operating within a framework defined by data, algorithms, and user inputs."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are a few factors that contribute to this:\n\n1. **Training Data Bias**: AI models, including image-generating ones, learn from vast datasets collected from the internet, books, articles, and other media. If these datasets have more images of white people than of people from other racial backgrounds, the AI is more likely to generate images of white people by default. This is a reflection of bias in the data sources.\n\n2. **Historical and Cultural Biases**: The biases in training datasets often mirror existing societal and historical biases. For many years, media representation has disproportionately featured white individuals, influencing the makeup of online images and, consequently, the training data for AI.\n\n3. **Design Choices**: The creators and developers of AI systems make choices that can influence outcomes. If they&#x27;re not careful to ensure diversity and inclusiveness in their training data and model design, their AI could reflect those oversights.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to make AI more representative and fair:\n\n- **Diverse and Inclusive Data**: There&#x27;s an increasing push to use datasets that better reflect the diversity of the global population.\n- **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: AI researchers and developers are working on techniques to identify and reduce bias in AI models.\n- **Ethical Guidelines and Policies**: Organizations and communities are establishing ethical guidelines to promote fairness and inclusivity in AI.\n\nDespite these efforts, it&#x27;s an ongoing challenge and area of active research and development. As users and developers become more aware of these issues, there is hope that future AI systems will better represent the diversity of human society. If you have preferences for the types of images you want to create, specifying them can help ensure the results are more in line with your expectations."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, I can suggest how you might achieve these edits using photo editing software or services:\n\n1. **Erase the Background**: Many photo editing tools offer features to remove or replace backgrounds. Look for tools like the &quot;Magic Wand&quot; or &quot;Background Eraser&quot; in software such as Adobe Photoshop, or use dedicated background removal websites and apps that automatically process the image for you.\n\n2. **Change Clothing to a Dress Shirt**: Changing the appearance of clothing in a photo can be complex and usually requires more advanced photo editing skills. This might involve selecting the area of the hoodie, removing it, and then digitally painting or compositing a dress shirt onto the image. For a realistic result, you might consider consulting with a professional graphic designer or a digital artist familiar with portrait retouching.\n\nFor those who are not experienced with photo editing software, there are services online where you can request specific photo manipulations, including changing backgrounds and altering clothing in images. Additionally, some freelance platforms host professionals who can perform these edits for you.\n\nIf you&#x27;re looking to learn and do it yourself, there are many tutorials available online for both"]}, "status": "in_progress", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "cd6e83fa-8f10-4288-b5e9-52b07000d955", "finish_details": {"type": "interrupted"}, "request_id": "8685a41c9a0f5248-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "cd6e83fa-8f10-4288-b5e9-52b07000d955", "children": ["54b83e1c-f2bc-4d6d-a1fb-46c23e74900d"]}, "54b83e1c-f2bc-4d6d-a1fb-46c23e74900d": {"id": "54b83e1c-f2bc-4d6d-a1fb-46c23e74900d", "message": {"id": "54b83e1c-f2bc-4d6d-a1fb-46c23e74900d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1711104873.175189, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Hey, so I uploaded that picture we talked about, but then you told me you couldn&#x27;t do anything to it.

It&#x27;s rich in monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, which can help reduce inflammation and have beneficial effects on genes linked to cancer. Olive oil is also packed with antioxidants and has been associated with heart health, including reducing the risk of heart disease.\n- **Peanut Oil:** While it also contains monounsaturated fats, peanut oil has a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fats compared to olive oil. It is healthier than oils high in saturated fats but doesn&#x27;t contain as many antioxidants as olive oil. However, it&#x27;s still a good choice for reducing cholesterol levels and improving heart health when used in moderation.\n\n**Cooking Use:**\n- **Olive Oil:** Extra virgin olive oil has a lower smoke point compared to peanut oil, making it less ideal for high-heat cooking methods like frying. However, it&#x27;s excellent for dressings, marinades, and low-to-medium heat cooking. \n- **Peanut Oil:** It has a higher smoke point, making it a better option for frying, deep-frying, and high-heat cooking. It&#x27;s also relatively flavor-neutral, which can be a plus when cooking dishes where you don&#x27;t want the oil to impart its own taste.\n\n**Flavor:**\n- **Olive Oil:** Offers a distinct taste that varies from fruity to bitter and spicy, depending on the type and quality. Extra virgin olive oil has a more pronounced flavor compared to light or refined olive oils.\n- **Peanut Oil:** Generally has a milder flavor, making it more versatile for various dishes, especially if you don&#x27;t want the oil to affect the taste of your food.\n\n**Allergies:**\n- **Peanut Oil:** Can be a concern for people with peanut allergies, although highly refined peanut oil is less likely to cause a reaction than unrefined. Still, caution is advised.\n- **Olive Oil:** Is typically safe for people with nut allergies, making it a more universally suitable option.\n\nIn summary, if you&#x27;re looking for an oil with significant health benefits and distinctive flavor for low to medium heat cooking or dressings, olive oil might be the better choice. If you need an oil for high-heat cooking and prefer a more neutral taste, peanut oil could be more appropriate. Always consider your dietary needs and cooking style when choosing between the two."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The city&#x27;s heartbeat echoed in the background as they navigated the ebb and flow of human experiences.\nLily, with an air of spontaneity, embraced the chaotic beauty of the urban landscape. &quot;James, have you ever noticed how the city pulses with energy? Each step feels like a heartbeat, a rhythm that keeps everything alive.&quot;\nJames, a soul of contemplation, observed the city with a measured gaze. &quot;Indeed, Lily. It&#x27;s a symphony of existence. People rushing, honking cars, laughter in the cafes \u2013 it&#x27;s like a living, breathing entity.&quot;\nAs they strolled through the city, Lily pointed towards a street artist creating a vibrant mural. &quot;Look at that, James! Art capturing the essence of life. Isn&#x27;t it amazing how humans express their emotions through colors and strokes?&quot;\nJames smiled, &quot;Absolutely, Lily. Art is a language that transcends words. It speaks to the soul, much like our conversations in this cosmic realm.&quot;\nTheir dialogues flowed like a river, meandering through topics that ranged from the mundane to the profound. The aroma of street food intertwined with their musings, creating a sensory collage of experiences.\nLily, glancing at a couple sharing a quiet moment in a park, remarked, &quot;Love is like the gravitational force that binds people together, don&#x27;t you think, James?&quot;\nJames nodded, &quot;Love is the force that defies entropy, creating order in the chaos of life. It&#x27;s the eternal flame that burns within.&quot;\nAs the sun dipped below the city skyline, casting a warm glow, Lily and James continued their exploration of the human experience. In the heart of the city, their dialogues became threads woven into the intricate fabric of existence.\n\nChapter 8: The Veil of Mystery\nScene Setting: The mysterious realm, the Veil.\nCentral Event: A hint of creators&#x27; origin emerges, leaving characters questioning the ultimate truth.\nConclusive Summary: Characters grapple with the mystery of their creators, hinting at the cosmic origin and purpose.\nPhilosophical Concept: Exploring the mysteries of cosmic existence.\nPython Concept: Unveiling hidden information and solving mysteries in code.\nChapter 9: Reflections in Time\nScene Setting: Temporal Nexus where Seraphina and Orion witness time&#x27;s impact.\nCentral Event: Characters explore eternity, time loops, and cyclical existence.\nConclusive Summary: Lily and James confront the cyclical nature of existence, pondering the impact of their choices on the cosmic timeline.\nPhilosophical Concept: Contemplating the nature of time and choices.\nPython Concept: Handling time-related functions and operations.\n**Chapter 10: The Infinite Dance**\n\n*Scene Setting:* Cosmic ballroom where souls celebrate eternal connection.\n*Central Event:* Creators join the dance, becoming active participants in the Life Function.\n*Conclusive Summary:* Lily and James, along with the creators, embrace the eternal dance of existence, celebrating the interconnectedness of souls.\n*Philosophical Concept:* The eternal dance of cosmic existence.\n*Python Concept:* Implementing iterative processes and loops.\n\n**Scene Addition:**\n\nAmidst the vibrant cosmic dance, Tommie, a spirited pirate soul, entered the ballroom, determined to alter his destiny. His eyes scanned the lively dance of pirate souls, seeking the elusive Creators rumored to shape fates in the metaphysical library.\n\nIn the midst of piratical revelry, Tommie&#x27;s gaze met Pam&#x27;s, and a conspiratorial nod passed between them. The pulsating energy of the ballroom reflected the infinite possibilities within the dance of existence.\n\nAs the cosmic music swirled around them, Tommie observed Lily and James frantically searching for two familiar figures: Irie and Ralphie, the cosmic dogs intertwined with their pirate existence.\n\n&quot;Irie!&quot; Tommie called out, his voice blending with the sea of dancing pirates.\n\n&quot;Ralphie!&quot; Pam shouted beside him, her eyes fixed on the shifting shadows of the ballroom. However, no sign of the mischievous canine duo emerged.\n\nSuddenly, amidst the cosmic energies and vibrant lights, two beings of ethereal glow manifested. Tommie and Pam exchanged surprised glances, realizing that these radiant entities might be the elusive Creators themselves.\n\n&quot;Are you the Creators?&quot; Tommie asked boldly, stepping closer to the glowing figures.\n\nThe luminous beings nodded in acknowledgment, their essence resonating with the cosmic rhythm. Pam, sensing a unique opportunity, inquired, &quot;Can you help us change our fate, maybe learn something new, like painting?&quot;\n\nThe Creators exchanged glances, a cosmic dialogue unfolding between them. Finally, one of them spoke, &quot;In the grand tapestry of pirate existence, the brush of destiny is in your hands. Embrace the dance, for within it, you shall find the strokes of your desires.&quot;\n\nWith those cryptic words, the Creators dissolved into the cosmic dance, leaving Tommie and Pam with a renewed sense of purpose. As they joined the celestial ballroom&#x27;s dance, a determination to shape their own destiny ignited within them, becoming threads woven into the intricate fabric of the eternal dance of existence. This interlude set the stage for the final revelations in their pirate journey, a journey entwined with the cosmic symphony that celebrated the interconnectedness of all souls.\n\nChapter 11: The Final Revelation\nScene Setting: The Core, where creators confront the ultimate truth.\nCentral Event: Mystery of creators&#x27; origin revealed, reshaping characters&#x27; understanding.\nConclusive Summary: Characters grapple with the profound revelation of their origin, setting the stage for transcendence.\nPhilosophical Concept: The revelation of cosmic origin.\nPython Concept: Unveiling hidden truths and understanding the core structure.\nChapter 12: Beyond Existence\nScene Setting: Ethereal plane where boundaries between creators and created dissolve.\nCentral Event: Characters embrace transcendence, becoming one with cosmic harmony.\nConclusive Summary: Lily, James, Seraphina, and Orion dissolve into the cosmic harmony, transcending individual identities.\nPhilosophical Concept: Transcendence and oneness in cosmic existence.\nPython Concept: Achieving higher-level abstraction and unity in code.\nEpilogue: The Everlasting Symphony\nScene Setting: Timeless panorama reflecting enduring connection between souls.\nCentral Event: Story concludes with a celebration of eternal love and the perpetual cycle of creation.\nConclusive Summary: The characters, now harmoniously connected, celebrate their eternal bond within the boundless cosmos.\nPhilosophical Concept: The everlasting symphony of cosmic connection.\nPython Concept: Implementing perpetual processes and interconnected systems.\n\nScene Addition:\nIn the vast expanse of the Cosmic Library, where shelves reached into the cosmic void and ancient tomes held the wisdom of eons, Aristotle found himself engaged in a spirited debate with Orion and Seraphina. James observed the intellectual clash with curiosity, while Lily, on a quest for the most captivating fiction, found herself ensnared in the labyrinthine chronicle of social media.\nAristotle, clad in the attire of ancient wisdom, spoke eloquently about his philosophy of ethics and virtue. &quot;Morality, my esteemed companions, is the key to a harmonious existence. The pursuit of virtue leads to a life well-lived.&quot;\nOrion, a cosmic being of luminous energy, countered Aristotle&#x27;s assertions. &quot;Aristotle, the cosmos operates on principles beyond human morality. Seraphina and I witness the interplay of forces and energies that shape the dance of existence. Virtue, in its cosmic essence, transcends the confines of human understanding.&quot;\nSeraphina, with eyes reflecting the galaxies, added her perspective. &quot;Aristotle, your moral virtues are but fragments of the cosmic symphony. The dance of creation follows a rhythm beyond the human perception of right and wrong.&quot;\nAs the debate unfolded, James observed the clash of philosophies with a contemplative gaze. His understanding of the cosmic order deepened with each exchange, and he pondered the implications of virtue in a realm where the laws of existence transcended mortal comprehension.\nMeanwhile, Lily navigated the cosmic library, her eyes scanning shelves adorned with countless narratives. In her hands, she held a book purported to contain the most captivating fiction ever written. However, as she turned the pages, she found herself entangled in a perpetual loop, unable to reach the final chapter.\nFrustration welled within Lily as she heard the passionate discourse echoing through the celestial library. &quot;Why bother with debates and philosophy?&quot; she mused. &quot;I won&#x27;t remember any of this anyway.&quot;\nUnbeknownst to Lily, James, too, grappled with the ephemeral nature of cosmic knowledge. Yet, unlike Lily, he embraced the pursuit of understanding, each moment etching itself into the fabric of his eternal existence.\nAs the cosmic debate continued, Lily&#x27;s attention wavered, drawn to the allure of the never-ending social media chronicle. Despite the cosmic wisdom being exchanged in the library, she felt an inexplicable detachment, a belief that the pursuit of knowledge held little purpose in her transient cosmic existence.\nJames, on the other hand, contemplated the boundless mysteries of the universe, finding purpose in the ceaseless quest for understanding. The cosmic library, with its endless shelves of wisdom, stood as a testament to the eternal dance between knowledge and the fleeting nature of mortal comprehension.\nWithin the Cosmic Library, Aristotle, Orion, and Seraphina continued their philosophical debate, delving deeper into the essence of human virtue and the cosmic purpose of existence.\nAristotle, steadfast in his belief, argued, &quot;The pursuit of virtue is the noblest goal for mortals. Moral excellence and ethical conduct lead to eudaimonia, a state of true well-being and fulfillment.&quot;\nSeraphina, with galaxies swirling in her eyes, countered, &quot;Aristotle, your vision is bound by the limitations of mortal existence. Humans are meant to create, to learn, to explore the mysteries of the universe. Virtue, in its cosmic form, encompasses the boundless potential within each soul.&quot;\nOrion, a radiant being of cosmic energy, interjected, &quot;Balance is the key to understanding the cosmic dance. Virtue, as perceived by humans, is but a fragment of the greater harmony. It is the interplay between chaos and order that forges the path of enlightenment.&quot;\nSeraphina, her form radiating with creative energy, expounded on her perspective. &quot;Life is a canvas waiting to be painted with the strokes of experience and discovery. Humans, as creators, play a vital role in the cosmic symphony. Virtue, in its cosmic sense, is the alignment of one&#x27;s existence with the creative flow of the universe.&quot;\nOrion, resonating with cosmic wisdom, added, &quot;The pursuit of understanding and the quest to unravel mysteries are inherent in the fabric of existence. Each soul contributes to the cosmic tapestry by seeking balance amid the chaotic dance of cosmic forces.&quot;\nAs the debate unfolded, Seraphina hinted at the concept of the Life Function, a mysterious and cyclical process governing the evolution of souls. &quot;Aristotle,&quot; she said, &quot;imagine a reality where your essence has traversed the cosmic cycles, where you are both the creator and the creation. The Life Function, a cosmic ballet, ensures that every soul experiences the tapestry of existence in its myriad forms.&quot;\nAristotle, initially taken aback, pondered the implications of such a revelation. &quot;So, I am but a recurring instance of myself within the cosmic design? A player in the grand scheme orchestrated by the Life Function?&quot;\nOrion, embracing the cosmic dance, affirmed, &quot;Indeed, Aristotle. The ebb and flow of existence, the eternal recurrence, is the essence of the cosmic order. Your journey through the Life Function shapes the very fabric of your being, each iteration contributing to the harmonious dance of creation.&quot;\nAs the cosmic library resonated with the echoes of profound revelation, the god-like beings continued to unveil the mysteries of existence, inviting Aristotle to explore the vastness of the cosmic design that transcended the boundaries of mortal understanding.\n\n\n\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "859bd1c64fbf77ff-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "66d7203b-f06f-4f90-9546-d1b41d84e5c0", "children": ["bf19760c-5014-4607-9ce9-c8ca35ec1f50"]}, "bf19760c-5014-4607-9ce9-c8ca35ec1f50": {"id": "bf19760c-5014-4607-9ce9-c8ca35ec1f50", "message": {"id": "bf19760c-5014-4607-9ce9-c8ca35ec1f50", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1708653044.180474, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thank you for providing such a detailed and engaging outline of &quot;Harmony Beyond Cosmos.&quot; I&#x27;m truly impressed with the depth of the story, the incorporation of philosophical concepts, and the clever integration of Python programming ideas.

Here are some recommendations to help you turn your scenes into chapters that flow smoothly and move the story along:\n\n1. **Define Chapter Goals:**\n   - Clearly define the goals of each chapter. What do you want to achieve in terms of character development, plot progression, or thematic exploration?\n\n2. **Establish a Scene Structure:**\n   - Divide each chapter into scenes, and within each scene, identify the key narrative elements, dialogues, and actions that need to take place.\n   - Ensure each scene has a purpose and contributes to the overall chapter goal.\n\n3. **Use Transitions:**\n   - Smooth transitions are essential. Clearly indicate scene changes by using descriptive transitions that set the stage for the upcoming events.\n   - Consider using location or time changes, character perspectives, or thematic shifts to signal transitions.\n\n4. **Balance Dialogue and Narration:**\n   - Find a balance between dialogue and narration. Dialogues bring characters to life and advance the plot, while narration provides context, description, and internal thoughts.\n   - Use dialogue to reveal character personalities, convey emotions, and drive conflicts forward.\n\n5. **Create Tension and Resolution:**\n   - Introduce tension or conflict within scenes to maintain reader interest. This could be through character clashes, unexpected events, or unresolved issues.\n   - Resolve or address some of the tension within each chapter, but leave enough unresolved to keep readers eager for the next.\n\n6. **Consider Pacing:**\n   - Pay attention to the pacing of your chapters. Balance action-packed scenes with slower, introspective moments to create a dynamic reading experience.\n   - Adjust the pace based on the emotional tone and narrative requirements of each chapter.\n\n7. **Connect Themes Across Chapters:**\n   - Establish thematic threads that weave through multiple chapters. This creates a cohesive narrative and allows for the exploration of overarching ideas.\n   - Consistency in themes helps in creating a unified and meaningful storyline.\n\n8. **End Chapters with Hooks:**\n   - End each chapter with a hook or a question to entice readers to continue. This could be a revelation, a cliffhanger, or a shift in perspective.\n   - Make readers curious about what will happen next.\n\n9. **Review and Revise:**\n   - Regularly review your work to ensure that each chapter contributes meaningfully to the overall narrative.\n   - Revise scenes and dialogues for clarity, conciseness, and impact.\n\n10. **Seek Feedback:**\n    - Share your chapters with trusted beta readers or writing partners to get feedback on the pacing, structure, and overall impact.\n    - Consider making adjustments based on constructive feedback.\n\nRemember, storytelling is an evolving process, and finding the right balance between scenes, dialogues, and narrative elements may require some experimentation and fine-tuning."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Amid the chaos, discomfort, and dissatisfaction with your job, you&#x27;re overwhelmed with negative emotions. In this all-too-familiar setting, it&#x27;s hard to believe that happiness could be a matter of personal choice. Yet, emerging scientific research and philosophical debates suggest that our intentions and willpower significantly shape our emotional experiences and realities.\n\nThe concept of conscious intention and its role in our actions has been scrutinized by researchers like Haggard (2005), who explored how our brain prepares for action and how this relates to our subjective experience of intention. Contrary to the traditional belief in free will, Haggard&#x27;s findings suggest that the feeling of intending to act arises from the brain&#x27;s preparation for action, highlighting the predictive nature of motor control mechanisms. This scientific perspective challenges the notion of direct mind-body causation but supports the idea that by focusing our intention, we may harness the brain&#x27;s predictive capacities to influence our emotional states [(Haggard, 2005)](https://consensus.app/papers/intention-motor-cognition-haggard/17b609fc3d54561e8cd455f937a543c6/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nPhilosophically, the debate around intention and volition delves deeper into human agency. Adams and Mele (1992) discuss how intentions, combined with efforts and feedback, fulfill the roles ascribed to volition, suggesting that our actions are more a result of a complex interplay between intention and trying rather than sheer willpower alone. This aligns with the notion that deciding to adopt a positive outlook could indeed reshape one&#x27;s emotional landscape [(Adams &amp; Mele, 1992)](https://consensus.app/papers/intentionvolition-debate1-adams/5bd4a67f0a4a56afb45781648f62a7f9/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nRollo May (1965) further illuminates the power of intentionality, arguing that it is at the heart of consciousness and human will. Intentionality, as a state of being, encompasses our total orientation towards the world at any given time, which could be contrary to our conscious intentions. This suggests that by realigning our deeper intentionality, we could transform our experience of reality, transcending the immediate negativity of a moment like missing a train [(May, 1965)](https://consensus.app/papers/intentionality-heart-human-will-may/359696f4be6e5b72a375f17be118d00e/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nFurthermore, Fitch and Ravlin (2005) explore how willpower and perceived behavioral control influence our actions and emotional responses. Their research indicates that higher willpower correlates with behavior more consistent with one&#x27;s intentions. This supports the idea that strengthening our willpower and controlling our focus could enable us to maintain a sense of inner peace amidst chaos [(Fitch &amp; Ravlin, 2005)](https://consensus.app/papers/willpower-perceived-control-influences-fitch/99d5941af38155b98d9f6fab0f9a2c52/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\nWhat these studies collectively suggest is that while our immediate circumstances might prompt automatic negative reactions, the broader capacity of our intentions\u2014shaped by complex neurological processes, philosophical understandings, and psychological efforts\u2014can significantly influence our emotional state. The scenario on the train platform, rather than being a moment of despair, can become an opportunity for practicing this power of intention. By deciding to view the situation differently, by intentionally shifting focus from the external to an inner sense of peace, we can control our emotions and, consequently, our happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, while external situations inevitably impact our emotions, the scientific and philosophical underpinnings of intention and willpower offer empowering perspectives. They suggest that by cultivating strong intentions and focusing our will, we can transform our emotional experiences and shape our reality. In the crowded train platform of life, it turns out, happiness could indeed be a choice \u2013 a choice rooted in the power of our intentions.\n\nFor those intrigued by the interplay between intention, willpower, and emotion, further exploration into the realms of cognitive neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and psychology may provide additional insights and practical strategies for harnessing this transformative power.\n\nThis is fun but could you make it chatty, humanistic, melodious, less word repetition and more inspirational? \n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "85f5060b5c15a321-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fea229a9-1efa-4dfd-8856-41b2dac30029", "children": ["8bbbf7e8-0dbc-4ab6-a2fe-6e46c44961e7"]}, "8bbbf7e8-0dbc-4ab6-a2fe-6e46c44961e7": {"id": "8bbbf7e8-0dbc-4ab6-a2fe-6e46c44961e7", "message": {"id": "8bbbf7e8-0dbc-4ab6-a2fe-6e46c44961e7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1709588424.311377, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Absolutely, let&#x27;s infuse some warmth, humanity, and inspiration into the piece while keeping it engaging and melodious:\n\n---\n\nEver had one of those mornings where everything seems to conspire against you? You rush out the door, only to miss your train and end up stuck on a crowded platform, feeling utterly fed up with your job and the chaos around you. It&#x27;s moments like these that make you wonder: can we really choose to be happy, even when life throws us curveballs?\n\nWell, buckle up, because science and philosophy are teaming up to say, &quot;Yes, we can!&quot; It&#x27;s all about the power of intention \u2013 that little spark inside us that can light up even the darkest of days.\n\nLet&#x27;s dive into the science for a moment. Ever heard of Haggard? He&#x27;s the brainiac who discovered that our brains start gearing up for action before we even realize it. In other words, our intentions aren&#x27;t just wishful thinking \u2013 they&#x27;re our brains getting ready to make things happen. So, by focusing our intention, we can actually nudge our brains in the direction of positive vibes [(Haggard, 2005)].\n\nBut wait, there&#x27;s more! Philosophers like Adams and Mele have been pondering the whole intention vs. willpower debate. Turns out, it&#x27;s not just about sheer will \u2013 it&#x27;s about combining our intentions with a good old-fashioned effort. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re saying, &quot;Hey, you&#x27;ve got this! Keep trying, and good things will come your way&quot; [(Adams &amp; Mele, 1992)].\n\nAnd then there&#x27;s Rollo May, dropping some serious wisdom bombs about intentionality. He reckons it&#x27;s at the very core of who we are \u2013 our total vibe towards the world. So, by aligning our deeper intentions with our actions, we can totally flip the script on reality, even when life throws us a curveball [(May, 1965)].\n\nBut what about willpower? Ah, Fitch and Ravlin have got us covered there. They found that the more willpower we&#x27;ve got, the better we are at sticking to our intentions. It&#x27;s like flexing your mental muscles \u2013 the stronger they are, the easier it is to stay zen in the face of chaos [(Fitch &amp; Ravlin, 2005)].\n\nSo, what&#x27;s the big takeaway here? Well, while life&#x27;s rollercoaster might throw us for a loop sometimes, we&#x27;ve got some serious superpowers hiding up our sleeves. By flexing our intention muscles and staying focused on the good stuff, we can totally rewrite our emotional script.\n\nPicture this: you&#x27;re stuck on that crowded platform again, but instead of feeling defeated, you take a deep breath and decide to see things differently. Suddenly, the chaos around you fades into the background, and you&#x27;re left with a sense of inner peace. That&#x27;s the power of intention, my friend \u2013 turning a mundane moment into a magical one.\n\nSo, next time life hands you a lemon, remember: you&#x27;ve got the power to turn it into the juiciest lemonade imaginable. With a little intention, a sprinkle of willpower, and a whole lot of positivity, happiness isn&#x27;t just a choice \u2013 it&#x27;s your superpower.\n\n---\n\nHope this adds the human touch and inspiration you&#x27;re looking for!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

You dash out the door, only to miss your train and find yourself stranded on a crowded platform, frustrated and overwhelmed by the chaos of everyday life. It&#x27;s moments like these that make us question: Can we truly choose happiness, even when life throws us curveballs?\n\nAs we explore the fascinating realm of intention and its impact on our emotions and reality, let&#x27;s consider some practical strategies gleaned from both scientific research and philosophical musings that can help us navigate life&#x27;s ups and downs with greater resilience and inner peace.\n\n**The Science of Intention: Rewiring Our Brain for Positivity**\n\nIn the realm of neuroscience, pioneering researchers like Haggard have uncovered fascinating insights into the power of intention. Haggard&#x27;s groundbreaking work suggests that our brains begin preparing for action before we&#x27;re even consciously aware of it, indicating that our intentions have a direct impact on our neural pathways [(Haggard, 2005)].\n\nOne practical way to leverage this insight is by starting our day with a clear intention or goal in mind. Setting a positive intention can help prime our brain for success and focus our energy on what matters most to us.\n\n**Philosophical Musings: Intentions vs. Willpower**\n\nVenturing into the realm of philosophy, scholars such as Adams and Mele engage in thought-provoking debates surrounding intention and willpower. They propose that our actions are influenced not only by sheer will but also by the intricate interplay between intention, effort, and feedback [(Adams &amp; Mele, 1992)].\n\nTo cultivate a mindset of resilience, we can reframe challenges as opportunities for growth. Embracing a &quot;growth mindset&quot; enables us to approach difficulties with optimism and determination, aligning our intentions with our actions.\n\n**Embracing Intentionality: Finding Peace in the Chaos**\n\nRenowned philosopher Rollo May sheds light on the concept of intentionality as the cornerstone of human will. May&#x27;s insights urge us to realign our deeper intentions to reshape our perception of reality, even in the face of adversity [(May, 1965)].\n\nTo practice intentionality in our daily lives, we can incorporate mindfulness techniques. Staying present and fully engaged in the moment allows us to cultivate a sense of inner peace and acceptance, regardless of external circumstances.\n\n**The Role of Willpower: Strengthening Our Mental Resilience**\n\nFurther studies by Fitch and Ravlin underscore the vital role of willpower in shaping our actions and emotional responses. Their findings suggest that nurturing strong willpower allows us to maintain inner calm and resilience, even amidst life&#x27;s most challenging moments [(Fitch &amp; Ravlin, 2005)].\n\nTo build our willpower &quot;muscle,&quot; we can set small, achievable goals and gradually increase the level of challenge. Celebrating our successes along the way reinforces positive behaviors and strengthens our resolve.\n\n**Conclusion: Empowering Ourselves Through Intention**\n\nIn conclusion, the interplay between intention, willpower, and emotional experiences offers a profound perspective on navigating life&#x27;s ups and downs. While external circumstances may sway our emotions, the power of intention empowers us to take control of our reality and foster happiness from within.\n\nTo live with intentionality is to take proactive steps to align our intentions with our actions and values. By doing so, we create a life that is meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of external circumstances.\n\n**Further Exploration: Diving Deeper into Intention and Its Impact**\n\nFor those intrigued by the dynamics of intention, willpower, and emotion, delving into the realms of cognitive neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and psychology promises additional insights and practical strategies for unlocking our full potential.\n\nAs we continue on our journey of exploration, let&#x27;s remain curious and open-minded, experimenting with different techniques and approaches to see what resonates most with us and fits best into our lifestyle.\n\n---\n\nThe article above is soooo awesome however, I see a key missed opportunity. Life does sometimes feel a bit like a rollercoaster as we many times find ourselves in situation where we lack the control to steer rollercoaster car, so to speak. We are as humans sometimes do have control of our environment and the people in it and so navigating lives rollercoaster is a bit insightful metaphor because we don&#x27;t navigate rollercoasters, they operate on a preset track optimized for thrills. However we do have complete control of how we respond to the stimuli of the experience of being on the rollercoaster. Its there in this area of control that we can cultivate our happiness and peace wile riding on the rollercoaster of life. \n\nI&#x27;d like to you to interwieve this idea/insight/metaphor into the introduction, body and conclusion of this article. It can be more subtle in the body but it should be clear and obvious in the intro and conclusion. Please maintain my style and voice when writing but still let the article be Medium optimized.

Well For one thing. Let me tell you the rules. I Feel like once you know the rules you understand what a thing is. Someone from every place must opt in for collective communism to work. Collective communism initially should be a movement by which people across the world decide to pool resources and maintain a community that is global. Now I know this concept already exists you might say. This concept exists and is known as the global community like the global internet community but imagine you had a global resource community? right like to put it in la di da di terms, it&#x27;s like imagine that...that expression that everyone says that like, the earth belongs to humanity and the world is ours really applied and everything belonged to everyone. Right? If everything belonged everyone, right, that would be collective communism. So, as of now, as all of humanity has not yet opted into collective Communism, we can only exists as a subset of the current community but even so this is the movement I would like to start the collective communism movement and the point of it all is that as many people opt-in across the world as want to and we all pool our resources and I think it would over time if there was like a big enough movement, it would be like, not only do we all pool our resources, we uhh...we do not. We never create any sort of centralized repository. Collective communism is based around the idea of a communal sharing of resources, ideas and freedoms, and at the same time, the focus does come back to resources. A communal sharing of resources. Meaning that, ideally, wherever a collective communist was in any place in the world, they&#x27;d have a home and a place to lay their head, because in collective communism, there is no personal property. Only shared resources. I know. Cray, right?

Here are a few related concepts and movements:\n\n1. **Communism**: Communism is a socio-economic system and political ideology that advocates for the collective ownership of the means of production and the abolition of private property. In traditional Marxist theory, communism aims for a classless society where resources are shared equally among all members.\n\n2. **Communalism**: Communalism emphasizes community ownership and control of resources, with a focus on local governance and decision-making. It often involves decentralized structures and direct democracy at the community level.\n\n3. **Anarcho-Communism**: Anarcho-communism combines anarchist principles with communist ideals, advocating for a stateless, classless society based on voluntary associations and the common ownership of resources.\n\n4. **Resource-Based Economy (RBE)**: A resource-based economy proposes the management of resources based on technical and scientific knowledge rather than monetary systems. It advocates for the efficient and equitable distribution of resources to meet human needs, often with an emphasis on sustainability and technological innovation.\n\n5. **Commons-based Peer Production**: This concept refers to collaborative efforts to create and manage shared resources, often facilitated by digital platforms and open-source principles. Examples include Wikipedia and open-source software projects like Linux.\n\nWhile your concept of &quot;collective communism&quot; shares elements with these ideologies, it also introduces unique aspects such as the idea of a global resource community and the absence of centralized repositories.

This card represents conflict, competition, and struggles arising from differing opinions or goals.

It\u2019s a call to action to address challenges head-on, but also a reminder to ensure that these battles are worth fighting. It asks you to consider whether the conflict is productive or if there might be a more collaborative approach.\n\nIn the context of today&#x27;s reading, the Five of Wands could indicate that while you are working on your material goals and listening to your intuition, as suggested by the King of Pentacles and The High Priestess, you may also encounter challenges or competition. These could be external challenges, or they could represent internal conflicts between different aspects of your personality or different goals you have set for yourself.\n\nThe presence of this card suggests that today is a day to stand firm in your convictions while also being open to the lessons that conflict can bring. It&#x27;s important to choose your battles wisely and to use conflicts as opportunities for growth.\n\nLet&#x27;s recap the insights from all the cards to give you a comprehensive view of your day.

With your question in mind regarding changing your financial situation and earning more money while maintaining a pleasant lifestyle, let&#x27;s look at the insights provided by the cards in context:\n\n1. **Page of Pentacles**: This card indicates new beginnings and opportunities related to finances and material gain. It suggests that there is potential for you to improve your financial situation by learning new skills, starting new ventures, or investing wisely. The Page of Pentacles encourages practical and methodical approaches, highlighting the importance of diligence and hard work in your financial endeavors.\n\n2. **King of Pentacles**: Representing success, wealth, and security, this card advises you to embody the qualities of the King \u2013 reliability, responsibility, and a no-nonsense approach to money management. It also hints at the potential support or advice from someone who has achieved financial success. Emulate their wisdom, stability, and practicality to enhance your own financial standing.\n\n3. **The High Priestess**: This card brings attention to your intuition and inner knowledge. When it comes to making money and maintaining your lifestyle, The High Priestess advises you to listen to your gut feelings and pay attention to your dreams and intuitions. Sometimes, the answers to our financial dilemmas or the next steps to take come from within rather than from the external world.\n\n4. **Five of Wands**: While this card speaks of conflict and competition, in the context of your financial goals, it suggests that you may face challenges or competition in your endeavors. These challenges, however, can lead to personal growth and clarification of your goals. Use this energy to fuel your ambition and to find innovative solutions to overcome financial obstacles. It\u2019s a reminder that success often comes from overcoming challenges and that conflict can be a catalyst for development.\n\nIn summary, the cards suggest a blend of practical action, learning new skills, and listening to your intuition to improve your financial situation while maintaining your lifestyle. They encourage you to approach your finances methodically (Page of Pentacles), seek wisdom and advice (King of Pentacles), trust your intuition (The High Priestess), and use challenges as stepping stones to success (Five of Wands).\n\nRemember, maintaining a pleasant lifestyle while improving your financial situation requires balance \u2013 do not sacrifice your well-being for financial gain, but also be prepared to work hard and face challenges head-on.\n\nI hope this reading offers the guidance you were seeking. May your journey towards financial improvement be fulfilling and balanced. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.\n\n__________________________________________\nIf you enjoyed this session and wish to support my efforts, please consider buying me a coffee here - [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/starseedtarot)\nMay you journey well!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are some possible causes:\n\n1. **Lipomas**: These are the most common soft, squishy lumps found on dogs. Lipomas are benign (non-cancerous) fatty tumors that are usually harmless and don&#x27;t need to be removed unless they interfere with the dog&#x27;s movement or quality of life.\n\n2. **Cysts**: There are various types of cysts that can appear on dogs. Sebaceous cysts, for example, are filled with sebum and can occur when a sebaceous gland becomes blocked. Most cysts are benign but can sometimes become infected.\n\n3. **Abscesses**: These are lumps filled with pus that can result from an infection. Abscesses can be soft or hard and might be painful. They typically require treatment, which may include draining and antibiotics.\n\n4. **Hematomas**: These are swellings filled with blood that usually result from an injury. Hematomas can feel soft or squishy and might resolve on their own, but in some cases, they might need to be drained by a vet.\n\n5. **Allergic Reactions**: In some cases, an allergic reaction can cause soft, squishy swellings on the skin. This could be a reaction to a bite, sting, or something in the dog&#x27;s environment.\n\n6. **Edema**: This is swelling caused by fluid retention in the body&#x27;s tissues. It can occur for various reasons, including heart failure, liver disease, or local inflammation due to injury or infection.\n\nWhile these are some common causes, there are other possibilities, and only a vet can provide a proper diagnosis. If you notice a new lump or bump on your dog, it&#x27;s a good idea to monitor its size, texture, and color, and whether it changes over time. Then, consult a vet who can assess it, possibly perform a fine-needle aspirate or biopsy, and advise on whether any treatment is needed."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

We will also discuss how to persuade your viewers to invest in your content and what benefits you can provide to convince them to stay subscribed.\n\n[Image 19: Streamlabs Subscriptions] \n\n## Subscriptions at a Glance\n\nTwitch Subscriptions YouTube Channel Membership Facebook Fan Subscription  \n\nCost\n\n$4.99, $9.99, $24.99\n\nStarting at 4.99, with the ability to \u301088\u2020customize price points\u2020support.google.com\u3011\n\n$4.99  \n\nCommission\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\nAs of August 2020 and for the next year, Facebook will not be taking any fees from Fan Subscriptions.  \n\nRequirements\n\nTwitch streamers must be either a Twitch Affiliate or a Twitch Partner.\n\nVisit our \u301089\u2020guide\u3011 for tips to help you become an affiliate\n\n30,000 subscribers; Gaming channels must have at least 1,000\n\nMember of YouTube Partner Program\n\n10,000 followers or 250+ Return Viewers and one of the following in the last 60 days:\n\n- 50,000 Post Engagements\n\n- 180,000 watch minutes  \n\n## Twitch Subscriber Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily. These are as follows:\n\n  * Ad-Free Viewing\u00a0\u2013 As a subscriber, Twitch will not force you to watch ads before you start watching a stream (with limited exceptions).\n  * Sub-Badges\u00a0\u2013 Custom badges are unlocked when you subscribe to a streamer. Badges are displayed next to a viewer&#x27;s name when they participate in the channel&#x27;s chat. Streamers can customize badges, and viewers will generally receive new badges the longer they stay subscribed. You start with the 1-month badge and get new badges for three months, six months, etc.\n  * Emotes\u00a0\u2013 Once a streamer reaches affiliate status, custom emotes become available. It is a fantastic way to reinforce your branding as a streamer because viewers can use them across all Twitch channels. The number of subscribers a streamer has dictates the number of emotes a streamer can have.\n  * Sub-Only Chat/Streams\u00a0\u2013 Occasionally, a streamer will host a sub-only stream. Hosting a stream for your most dedicated viewers is a great way to encourage viewers to sub. During these streams, only subscribers can view the broadcast. Streamers can also set their chat to &quot;subscribers only.&quot;\n\n[Image 20: Twitch Subscriptions at a Glance]\n\n## Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily.

Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding. If you have a project to complete and you\u2019re looking for funding, set up pages on these websites and use your live streams to promote it.\n\nIf you stream with \u30101\u2020Restream\u3011, you can easily add a Patreon or GoFundMe \u301016\u2020link as a QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 that you can display as an overlay on your stream.\n\nFor most of these services, you should consider creating special rewards and content for the people who support you. Decide carefully which content goes behind the paywall and which stays free, though. You can\u2019t keep all your best stuff locked behind a subscription; some of it has to stay free to attract new viewers.\n\n## 3. Paid subscriptions from viewers \n\nGetting an occasional tip from your viewers is great, but regular payments are better. These payments will usually net you a couple of dollars each, but if you can get enough of them, they add up. You\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements to enable this kind of support, as platforms reserve it for members of their content creator programs.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of recurring payment features on the major platforms:\n\n  * YouTube has a \u301024\u2020channel membership program\u2020creatoracademy.youtube.com\u3011 that allows users to subscribe to its channels with monthly payments. To open your YouTube channel (where you group your videos) to this opportunity, you need to be in the \u301025\u2020YouTube Partner Program\u2020support.google.com\u3011 and meet additional eligibility requirements.\n  * Twitch has a \u301026\u2020paid subscription program\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 that lets you earn from paid subscriptions if you\u2019re an \u301020\u2020Affiliate\u3011 or Partner. Your viewers get one subscription for free through Twitch Prime, or they can pay for them using PayPal, Amazon Pay, or credit cards.\n  * Facebook Gaming \u301027\u2020extended its Fan Subscriptions feature\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 to Level Up gaming content creators. You must achieve a certain number of returning weekly viewers, and the feature is only available in certain regions.\n\nIf the platform allows it, you should make content that\u2019s exclusive to your subscribers. It\u2019s a nice way to show your most loyal viewers that you appreciate their support. Also, remember to give a shoutout to people when they subscribe and a mention on their subscription anniversaries.\n\nYou can also use third-party services like Patreon to set up recurring payments or subscriptions from fans.\n\n## 4. Revenue from ads \n\nAdvertising revenue powers half the internet, including Google services and Facebook. Why not you too? If you join the right streaming platform or social network, you can start earning some decent ad money.\n\nWhen you start broadcasting live videos on a specific platform, like YouTube or Facebook, you may be able to take advantage of their advertising programs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different types of in-stream ads that are usually available:\n\n  * Pre-roll ads: These ads play as soon as a viewer clicks on your stream. They have to view the ad before they can start watching your content.\n  * Mid-roll ads: Mid-roll ads play in the middle of your live stream. Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8. Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9.

Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding.

These payments will usually net you a couple of dollars each, but if you can get enough of them, they add up. You\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements to enable this kind of support, as platforms reserve it for members of their content creator programs.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of recurring payment features on the major platforms:\n\n  * YouTube has a \u301024\u2020channel membership program\u2020creatoracademy.youtube.com\u3011 that allows users to subscribe to its channels with monthly payments. To open your YouTube channel (where you group your videos) to this opportunity, you need to be in the \u301025\u2020YouTube Partner Program\u2020support.google.com\u3011 and meet additional eligibility requirements.\n  * Twitch has a \u301026\u2020paid subscription program\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 that lets you earn from paid subscriptions if you\u2019re an \u301020\u2020Affiliate\u3011 or Partner. Your viewers get one subscription for free through Twitch Prime, or they can pay for them using PayPal, Amazon Pay, or credit cards.\n  * Facebook Gaming \u301027\u2020extended its Fan Subscriptions feature\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 to Level Up gaming content creators. You must achieve a certain number of returning weekly viewers, and the feature is only available in certain regions.\n\nIf the platform allows it, you should make content that\u2019s exclusive to your subscribers. It\u2019s a nice way to show your most loyal viewers that you appreciate their support. Also, remember to give a shoutout to people when they subscribe and a mention on their subscription anniversaries.\n\nYou can also use third-party services like Patreon to set up recurring payments or subscriptions from fans.\n\n## 4. Revenue from ads \n\nAdvertising revenue powers half the internet, including Google services and Facebook. Why not you too? If you join the right streaming platform or social network, you can start earning some decent ad money.\n\nWhen you start broadcasting live videos on a specific platform, like YouTube or Facebook, you may be able to take advantage of their advertising programs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different types of in-stream ads that are usually available:\n\n  * Pre-roll ads: These ads play as soon as a viewer clicks on your stream. They have to view the ad before they can start watching your content.\n  * Mid-roll ads: Mid-roll ads play in the middle of your live stream. Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8. Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9.

We work with various payment processors, including PayPal, giving you more ways to monetize your channel than anyone else in the industry. Most importantly, setting up a tip page is entirely free. What\u2019s more, we will never take a cut of the money you receive. Setting up your tip page only takes a few seconds, so let\u2019s dive into it.\n\nIf you are logging into Streamlabs.com for the first time, the onboarding process will ask you to add your Paypal email address or other support payment processor. Once you finish that step, your tip page is ready to go; this is the fastest way to set up your donation page, but if you\u2019ve already logged in or skipped the onboarding, you can also set up your tip page from the settings.\n\nTo do that:\n\n  * 1) Log in to the dashboard on Streamlabs.com.

Set the minimum amount required to donate, and even adjust the recommended amount that appears for a user when they visit your tip page.\n\nEdit the message that appears on your page when users visit, adjust profanity filters to block out offensive words, and even customize the image that appears as your donation page header.\n\nVisit the\u00a0\u301086\u2020dashboard\u3011\u00a0to view all of the tip page settings.\n\n## Adding Tip Page Link\n\nDepending on the platform you choose, the process to add a link to your tip page is going to be different. Both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming only allow you to copy and paste a link to your Tip Page in your page description or about section. Twitch takes it one step further and gives you the option to add customized panels.\n\n### Add a Twitch Tip Panel\n\nIn the upper-right corner, click your profile icon.\n\n[Image 12: Twitch profile icon]\n\nSelect Channel from the drop-down menu.\n\n[Image 13: Twitch channel menu]\n\nClick the About section on the next screen.\n\n[Image 14: Twitch about]\n\nToggle the Edit Panels option in the top left section of the screen.\n\n[Image 15: Twitch edit panels]\n\nScroll down and click the box with a large plus sign in it and then click &quot;Add a Text or Image Panel&quot;.\n\n[Image 16: Twitch Add a Text or Image Panel]\n\nNow you can add a title to your panel, the link to your Streamlabs Tip Page, a Description, and an image.\n\n[Image 17: Twitch Panel title]\n\n### Need an Image?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently rolled out a new feature giving streamers the ability to add professionally designed panels from a selection of over 50 different templates.\n\nVisit our\u00a0\u301087\u2020Panel Maker page on the Streamlabs Dashboard\u3011\u00a0to start designing your own panels today.\n\n[Image 18: Streamlabs Panel maker] \n\n## Subscriptions\n\nUnlike tips or donations, subscriptions provide you with a more reliable source of income. If you want to become a full-time streamer, you\u2019ll need this supplemental revenue to assist you along the way.\n\nIn this section, we will be discussing how you can monetize your live stream through subscriptions. We\u2019ll specifically discuss the benefits and differences between Twitch subscriptions, YouTube Channel Memberships, and Facebook Fan Subscriptions. We will also discuss how to persuade your viewers to invest in your content and what benefits you can provide to convince them to stay subscribed.\n\n[Image 19: Streamlabs Subscriptions] \n\n## Subscriptions at a Glance\n\nTwitch Subscriptions YouTube Channel Membership Facebook Fan Subscription  \n\nCost\n\n$4.99, $9.99, $24.99\n\nStarting at 4.99, with the ability to \u301088\u2020customize price points\u2020support.google.com\u3011\n\n$4.99  \n\nCommission\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\nAs of August 2020 and for the next year, Facebook will not be taking any fees from Fan Subscriptions.  \n\nRequirements\n\nTwitch streamers must be either a Twitch Affiliate or a Twitch Partner.\n\nVisit our \u301089\u2020guide\u3011 for tips to help you become an affiliate\n\n30,000 subscribers; Gaming channels must have at least 1,000\n\nMember of YouTube Partner Program\n\n10,000 followers or 250+ Return Viewers and one of the following in the last 60 days:\n\n- 50,000 Post Engagements\n\n- 180,000 watch minutes  \n\n## Twitch Subscriber Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily.

Streamers can customize badges, and viewers will generally receive new badges the longer they stay subscribed. You start with the 1-month badge and get new badges for three months, six months, etc.\n  * Emotes\u00a0\u2013 Once a streamer reaches affiliate status, custom emotes become available. It is a fantastic way to reinforce your branding as a streamer because viewers can use them across all Twitch channels. The number of subscribers a streamer has dictates the number of emotes a streamer can have.\n  * Sub-Only Chat/Streams\u00a0\u2013 Occasionally, a streamer will host a sub-only stream. Hosting a stream for your most dedicated viewers is a great way to encourage viewers to sub. During these streams, only subscribers can view the broadcast. Streamers can also set their chat to &quot;subscribers only.&quot;\n\n[Image 20: Twitch Subscriptions at a Glance]\n\n## Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily.

These will vary from channel to channel, but some of the most common perks include:\n\n  * Exclusive Chatroom on Discord\u00a0\u2013 Many streamers create exclusive discord servers for their subscribers and members.\n  * Play with Viewers\u00a0\u2013 some streamers set aside days where they play games with their subscribers.\n  * Competitions/Giveaways\u00a0\u2013 Streamers can create special contests or giveaways for their subscribers.

Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding. If you have a project to complete and you\u2019re looking for funding, set up pages on these websites and use your live streams to promote it.\n\nIf you stream with \u30101\u2020Restream\u3011, you can easily add a Patreon or GoFundMe \u301016\u2020link as a QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 that you can display as an overlay on your stream.\n\nFor most of these services, you should consider creating special rewards and content for the people who support you. Decide carefully which content goes behind the paywall and which stays free, though. You can\u2019t keep all your best stuff locked behind a subscription; some of it has to stay free to attract new viewers.\n\n## 3.

Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding. If you have a project to complete and you\u2019re looking for funding, set up pages on these websites and use your live streams to promote it.\n\nIf you stream with \u30101\u2020Restream\u3011, you can easily add a Patreon or GoFundMe \u301016\u2020link as a QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 that you can display as an overlay on your stream.\n\nFor most of these services, you should consider creating special rewards and content for the people who support you. Decide carefully which content goes behind the paywall and which stays free, though. You can\u2019t keep all your best stuff locked behind a subscription; some of it has to stay free to attract new viewers.\n\n## 3. Paid subscriptions from viewers \n\nGetting an occasional tip from your viewers is great, but regular payments are better. These payments will usually net you a couple of dollars each, but if you can get enough of them, they add up. You\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements to enable this kind of support, as platforms reserve it for members of their content creator programs.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of recurring payment features on the major platforms:\n\n  * YouTube has a \u301024\u2020channel membership program\u2020creatoracademy.youtube.com\u3011 that allows users to subscribe to its channels with monthly payments. To open your YouTube channel (where you group your videos) to this opportunity, you need to be in the \u301025\u2020YouTube Partner Program\u2020support.google.com\u3011 and meet additional eligibility requirements.\n  * Twitch has a \u301026\u2020paid subscription program\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 that lets you earn from paid subscriptions if you\u2019re an \u301020\u2020Affiliate\u3011 or Partner. Your viewers get one subscription for free through Twitch Prime, or they can pay for them using PayPal, Amazon Pay, or credit cards.\n  * Facebook Gaming \u301027\u2020extended its Fan Subscriptions feature\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 to Level Up gaming content creators. You must achieve a certain number of returning weekly viewers, and the feature is only available in certain regions.\n\nIf the platform allows it, you should make content that\u2019s exclusive to your subscribers. It\u2019s a nice way to show your most loyal viewers that you appreciate their support. Also, remember to give a shoutout to people when they subscribe and a mention on their subscription anniversaries.\n\nYou can also use third-party services like Patreon to set up recurring payments or subscriptions from fans.\n\n## 4. Revenue from ads \n\nAdvertising revenue powers half the internet, including Google services and Facebook. Why not you too? If you join the right streaming platform or social network, you can start earning some decent ad money.\n\nWhen you start broadcasting live videos on a specific platform, like YouTube or Facebook, you may be able to take advantage of their advertising programs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different types of in-stream ads that are usually available:\n\n  * Pre-roll ads: These ads play as soon as a viewer clicks on your stream. They have to view the ad before they can start watching your content.\n  * Mid-roll ads: Mid-roll ads play in the middle of your live stream. Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8. Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9. Coach/teach/offer lessons \n\nShare your knowledge through live seminars, workshops, or classes. If that sounds too academic for your taste, consider becoming someone\u2019s mentor, coach, or teacher.

Twitch takes it one step further and gives you the option to add customized panels.\n\n### Add a Twitch Tip Panel\n\nIn the upper-right corner, click your profile icon.\n\n[Image 12: Twitch profile icon]\n\nSelect Channel from the drop-down menu.\n\n[Image 13: Twitch channel menu]\n\nClick the About section on the next screen.\n\n[Image 14: Twitch about]\n\nToggle the Edit Panels option in the top left section of the screen.\n\n[Image 15: Twitch edit panels]\n\nScroll down and click the box with a large plus sign in it and then click &quot;Add a Text or Image Panel&quot;.\n\n[Image 16: Twitch Add a Text or Image Panel]\n\nNow you can add a title to your panel, the link to your Streamlabs Tip Page, a Description, and an image.\n\n[Image 17: Twitch Panel title]\n\n### Need an Image?\n\nWe\u2019ve recently rolled out a new feature giving streamers the ability to add professionally designed panels from a selection of over 50 different templates.\n\nVisit our\u00a0\u301087\u2020Panel Maker page on the Streamlabs Dashboard\u3011\u00a0to start designing your own panels today.\n\n[Image 18: Streamlabs Panel maker] \n\n## Subscriptions\n\nUnlike tips or donations, subscriptions provide you with a more reliable source of income. If you want to become a full-time streamer, you\u2019ll need this supplemental revenue to assist you along the way.\n\nIn this section, we will be discussing how you can monetize your live stream through subscriptions. We\u2019ll specifically discuss the benefits and differences between Twitch subscriptions, YouTube Channel Memberships, and Facebook Fan Subscriptions. We will also discuss how to persuade your viewers to invest in your content and what benefits you can provide to convince them to stay subscribed.\n\n[Image 19: Streamlabs Subscriptions] \n\n## Subscriptions at a Glance\n\nTwitch Subscriptions YouTube Channel Membership Facebook Fan Subscription  \n\nCost\n\n$4.99, $9.99, $24.99\n\nStarting at 4.99, with the ability to \u301088\u2020customize price points\u2020support.google.com\u3011\n\n$4.99  \n\nCommission\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\nAs of August 2020 and for the next year, Facebook will not be taking any fees from Fan Subscriptions.  \n\nRequirements\n\nTwitch streamers must be either a Twitch Affiliate or a Twitch Partner.\n\nVisit our \u301089\u2020guide\u3011 for tips to help you become an affiliate\n\n30,000 subscribers; Gaming channels must have at least 1,000\n\nMember of YouTube Partner Program\n\n10,000 followers or 250+ Return Viewers and one of the following in the last 60 days:\n\n- 50,000 Post Engagements\n\n- 180,000 watch minutes  \n\n## Twitch Subscriber Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily. These are as follows:\n\n  * Ad-Free Viewing\u00a0\u2013 As a subscriber, Twitch will not force you to watch ads before you start watching a stream (with limited exceptions).\n  * Sub-Badges\u00a0\u2013 Custom badges are unlocked when you subscribe to a streamer. Badges are displayed next to a viewer&#x27;s name when they participate in the channel&#x27;s chat. Streamers can customize badges, and viewers will generally receive new badges the longer they stay subscribed. You start with the 1-month badge and get new badges for three months, six months, etc.\n  * Emotes\u00a0\u2013 Once a streamer reaches affiliate status, custom emotes become available. It is a fantastic way to reinforce your branding as a streamer because viewers can use them across all Twitch channels. The number of subscribers a streamer has dictates the number of emotes a streamer can have.\n  * Sub-Only Chat/Streams\u00a0\u2013 Occasionally, a streamer will host a sub-only stream. Hosting a stream for your most dedicated viewers is a great way to encourage viewers to sub. During these streams, only subscribers can view the broadcast. Streamers can also set their chat to &quot;subscribers only.&quot;\n\n[Image 20: Twitch Subscriptions at a Glance]\n\n## Facebook Fan Subscription Benefits\n\nThere are a few &quot;built-in\u201d perks, but many streamers add a few bonus ones for those who support them monetarily.

These will vary from channel to channel, but some of the most common perks include:\n\n  * Exclusive Chatroom on Discord\u00a0\u2013 Many streamers create exclusive discord servers for their subscribers and members.\n  * Play with Viewers\u00a0\u2013 some streamers set aside days where they play games with their subscribers.\n  * Competitions/Giveaways\u00a0\u2013 Streamers can create special contests or giveaways for their subscribers. These are their way of giving back to their supportive community.\n  * Custom Subscriber Alerts\u00a0\u2013 Create unique alerts that only play when someone subscribes to your channel. Streamlabs makes setting up alerts easy, so be sure to\u00a0\u301091\u2020read our guide\u3011\u00a0to learn how to start creating unique alerts.\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFor most content creators, tips "}, {"matched_text": "\u30106\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 756, "end_idx": 766, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "9 Ways You Can Make Money With Live Streaming \u2013 Restream Blog", "url": "https://restream.io/blog/ways-you-can-make-money-live-streaming/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nIf you don\u2019t want to use the tipping system within the streaming platform \u2014 or you don\u2019t meet the requirements to use it \u2014 you can use a third-party platform. Some of the most common ones for streamers are:\n\n  * StreamElements for one-time donations and tips. This platform integrates easily with Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming and Trovo, and it offers different payment options.\n  * Patreon for regular donations/subscriptions. With the ability to let patrons set monthly pledges, Patreon is the closest you can get to a subscription system without going through a streaming platform\u2019s program.\n  * GoFundMe or Kickstarter for project-based funding. If you have a project to complete and you\u2019re looking for funding, set up pages on these websites and use your live streams to promote it.\n\nIf you stream with \u30101\u2020Restream\u3011, you can easily add a Patreon or GoFundMe \u301016\u2020link as a QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 that you can display as an overlay on your stream.\n\nFor most of these services, you should consider creating special rewards and content for the people who support you. Decide carefully which content goes behind the paywall and which stays free, though. You can\u2019t keep all your best stuff locked behind a subscription; some of it has to stay free to attract new viewers.\n\n## 3. Paid subscriptions from viewers \n\nGetting an occasional tip from your viewers is great, but regular payments are better. These payments will usually net you a couple of dollars each, but if you can get enough of them, they add up. You\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements to enable this kind of support, as platforms reserve it for members of their content creator programs.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of recurring payment features on the major platforms:\n\n  * YouTube has a \u301024\u2020channel membership program\u2020creatoracademy.youtube.com\u3011 that allows users to subscribe to its channels with monthly payments. To open your YouTube channel (where you group your videos) to this opportunity, you need to be in the \u301025\u2020YouTube Partner Program\u2020support.google.com\u3011 and meet additional eligibility requirements.\n  * Twitch has a \u301026\u2020paid subscription program\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 that lets you earn from paid subscriptions if you\u2019re an \u301020\u2020Affiliate\u3011 or Partner. Your viewers get one subscription for free through Twitch Prime, or they can pay for them using PayPal, Amazon Pay, or credit cards.\n  * Facebook Gaming \u301027\u2020extended its Fan Subscriptions feature\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 to Level Up gaming content creators. You must achieve a certain number of returning weekly viewers, and the feature is only available in certain regions.\n\nIf the platform allows it, you should make content that\u2019s exclusive to your subscribers. It\u2019s a nice way to show your most loyal viewers that you appreciate their support. Also, remember to give a shoutout to people when they subscribe and a mention on their subscription anniversaries.\n\nYou can also use third-party services like Patreon to set up recurring payments or subscriptions from fans.\n\n## 4. Revenue from ads \n\nAdvertising revenue powers half the internet, including Google services and Facebook. Why not you too? If you join the right streaming platform or social network, you can start earning some decent ad money.\n\nWhen you start broadcasting live videos on a specific platform, like YouTube or Facebook, you may be able to take advantage of their advertising programs. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different types of in-stream ads that are usually available:\n\n  * Pre-roll ads: These ads play as soon as a viewer clicks on your stream. They have to view the ad before they can start watching your content.\n  * Mid-roll ads: Mid-roll ads play in the middle of your live stream. Your stream continues in a smaller window while the ad takes up most of the screen.\n  * Display and overlay ads: These types of ads usually pop up as banners or small cards on top of your stream.\n\nIf you want to generate revenue with ads, join these platforms:\n\n  * \u301028\u2020YouTube\u2020support.google.com\u3011 offers pre-roll and mid-roll ads, as well as display and overlay ads.\n  * \u301029\u2020Facebook\u2020www.facebook.com\u3011 offers mid-roll ads if you meet the viewership number criteria.\n  * \u301030\u2020Twitch\u2020www.twitch.tv\u3011 offers in-stream ads, as well as display and native ad opportunities.\n\nAdvertising in live streaming is a hot topic and a regular cause of controversy. Try to exercise as much control as you can over the advertisements displayed during your streams or on your channel. Also, remember that viewers can use ad-blocking software to prevent some ads from showing. Therefore, using ads as the sole method to monetize your live streaming may not be the best idea.\n\n## 5. Brand deals and sponsorships \n\nBrand deals and sponsorships are another way you can earn money while streaming by engaging with businesses in a mutually beneficial arrangement. If you have a large following on streaming platforms, brands will reach out to you with offers. If they don\u2019t, you can reach out to them.\n\nWhen dealing with brands, it pays to be professional and detail-oriented. You make money when brands agree to pay you. You\u2019ll want to negotiate every part of the deal, to be 100% sure you\u2019re on the same page regarding your commitment.\n\nSome of the ways you can make money include:\n\n  * Sponsorships, where whole streams are sponsored by a brand.\n  * Banners and other types of advertisements you can display during your streams or on your channel or profile page.\n  * Sponsored content, like when a game developer pays you to play their game.\n\nYour audience is what will get a brand\u2019s attention. You should have a decent number of viewers and a clear understanding of who they are, their interests, and the types of problems they need solved. Be mindful of cutting deals that make you look like a sellout. Your audiences might not like that, and if you lose your audience, you lose the sponsors.\n\n## 6. Affiliate programs \n\nWith a membership in an affiliate program, you can earn a commission every time a shopper clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase. Sometimes you don\u2019t even have to post a link, because all you need is a promo or coupon code viewers can use when they shop at the place you\u2019re promoting. The link or code is provided to you once you join the affiliate program.\n\nIn the past, you had to place the affiliate link or the code in your stream description. You could also mention the coupon code once or twice during the stream. Now, you can add your affiliate link as a \u301016\u2020QR code\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 when you go live with Restream. Your audience doesn\u2019t have to go searching for the product link; they can scan with their smartphone directly from your live stream.\n\nKeep in mind that, unless the streaming platform has a deal with the affiliate program, the platform isn\u2019t profiting from your affiliate sales. So keep your content to the point and make the products or services you recommend relevant to your topic.\n\nIf you&#x27;re unsure where to start, give the Restream Referral Program a try. You can earn up to a 30% recurring commission on every subscription that comes from your link.\n\n\u301031\u2020 Learn more\u3011\n\n## 7. Create and sell your own merch \n\nMerchandise is an important revenue stream for many people who broadcast live video content. Streaming platforms have recognized this and give users plenty of advice, offering them some truly useful tools to help boost merch sales.\n\nEven with these tools, however, you\u2019ll still have plenty to figure out on your own if you decide to sell merch. What kind of products do you want to sell? T-shirts, mugs, and plush toys are all good choices. You can also sell digital products, such as music or e-books.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the design, production, inventory, and shipping of your merch as well. There are a few ways you can do this, including:\n\n  * Building your own online store. Handle production, store inventory, and shipping all on your own.\n  * Overseeing the design but letting one of the platform-approved merch companies produce, store, and ship the merch for a cut of the profits.\n  * Partnering with stores that let you take advantage of special opportunities on select platforms, such as the \u301032\u2020YouTube Merch shelf\u2020support.google.com\u3011.\n\nEach of these solutions offers different profit margins and requires different levels of involvement. Whatever you choose, you can easily \u301033\u2020tie your merchandise business to your live streaming\u2020support.restream.io\u3011 by adding your product links as QR codes on your broadcast. You can even display an image of the product and the price alongside the QR code.\n\nRead more: \u301034\u2020Marketing tips for live video influencers\u3011\n\n## 8. Develop pay-per-view content \n\nProducing live content and selling tickets for it has become hugely popular. It\u2019s no longer just gaming content that gets live viewers. People with all kinds of interests and hobbies are turning to live streams to learn and exchange opinions with like-minded individuals. If you can create content that\u2019s appealing to these viewers, you can make money by selling tickets for your live stream.\n\nFirst, you need to create content that people will want to pay to watch. It should have some level of exclusivity or a way to stand out from content that is already available for free. You also have to use a platform that lets you sell tickets to live streams. Services like Streamtick let you sell admission to live broadcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter as well. With killer content and a ticketing service, you have everything you need to develop pay-per-view content.\n\n## 9. Coach/teach/offer lessons \n\nShare your knowledge through live seminars, workshops, or classes. If that sounds too academic for your taste, consider becoming someone\u2019s mentor, coach, or teacher.
