Here are some steps and tips to help you find the most suitable grants:\n\n1. **Research Grants with a Cultural or Educational Focus**:\n   - Look for grants from the Department of Education, particularly those that support international education and cultural exchange programs.\n   - The Department of State also offers grants related to cultural diplomacy and international exchanges that might align with your mission.\n\n2. **Explore Funding from Cultural Institutions**:\n   - Organizations like the American Councils for International Education and similar bodies often have opportunities for projects that promote cultural understanding and exchange.\n\n3. **Consider Tourism and Economic Development Grants**:\n   - Check if the U.S. Department of Commerce or international trade associations offer grants that encourage tourism and cultural exchange, as these can directly relate to your mission of promoting happiness through travel.\n\n4. **Private Foundations and Nonprofit Grants**:\n   - Look into foundations that focus on cultural preservation, international relations, and global understanding. These might be more flexible regarding the scope of projects they support.\n\n5. **Utilize Grant Databases and Resources**:\n   - Use resources like Grants.gov, which is a comprehensive database where you can search for federal grants using keywords such as &quot;international travel&quot;, &quot;cultural exchange&quot;, or &quot;education.&quot;\n   - Foundation Directory Online is another resource for finding private grantmakers interested in cultural and educational initiatives.\n\n6. **Prepare a Strong Grant Proposal**:\n   - Emphasize how your project aligns with the grantor\u2019s objectives, such as promoting international understanding or boosting economic development through tourism.\n   - Clearly outline the impact of your initiatives, including both qualitative and quantitative benefits, like increased cultural awareness, tourism revenues, or educational outcomes.\n\nIf you need specific grant listings or further assistance with the application process, including crafting a compelling proposal, feel free to ask!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-VsurC06wF", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "1a406a81-64aa-42cf-b52d-8a6c45f7a29a", "request_id": "883668113c320e23-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "1a406a81-64aa-42cf-b52d-8a6c45f7a29a", "children": ["b548f7e9-0fad-460c-bc6b-b0c122a17c05"]}, "b548f7e9-0fad-460c-bc6b-b0c122a17c05": {"id": "b548f7e9-0fad-460c-bc6b-b0c122a17c05", "message": {"id": "b548f7e9-0fad-460c-bc6b-b0c122a17c05", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715642782.926905, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sprcific grant listings might be nice"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "883669bf4bcf0e23-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c813a9e4-46fe-4379-b5f6-26f1af471659", "children": ["b9b9861d-f9d0-46c9-b5b6-cec7beb59143"]}, "b9b9861d-f9d0-46c9-b5b6-cec7beb59143": {"id": "b9b9861d-f9d0-46c9-b5b6-cec7beb59143", "message": {"id": "b9b9861d-f9d0-46c9-b5b6-cec7beb59143", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715642807.592058, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To find specific grant listings that match your startup&#x27;s focus on happiness through international travel and cultural exchange, I&#x27;ll recommend a few potential sources and strategies:\n\n1. **Grants.gov**:\n   - This is the most comprehensive portal for U.S. government grants.

Check with your school&#x27;s financial aid office or the department of your master&#x27;s program for opportunities specific to your field of study.\n\n2. **Federal and State Grants**: \n   - Although the Pell Grant is for undergraduates, other federal grants like the **TEACH Grant** can help if you&#x27;re studying to become a teacher and plan to teach in a high-need field in a low-income area.\n   - State grants can also be available depending on where you live or where you plan to work after graduation.\n\n3. **Professional Associations**:\n   - Depending on your field of study, professional associations might offer grants, fellowships, or scholarships. For example, the American Psychological Association offers grants for psychology students.\n\n4. **Research Grants**:\n   - If your master\u2019s involves a significant amount of research, look for research grants from organizations like the National Science Foundation (NSF), especially if your research is in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.\n\n5. **Specialized Scholarships and Fellowships**:\n   - Organizations and foundations offer scholarships based on criteria such as field of study, cultural background, gender, and more. Websites like Fastweb, Scholarships.com, and the College Board can help you find these.\n\n6. **Employer Tuition Assistance**:\n   - Some employers offer tuition assistance programs for employees pursuing further education. Check if your employer offers such benefits.\n\nEach of these types of funding may have specific eligibility requirements and application processes, so it&#x27;s essential to read through the details carefully and prepare your application according to the guidelines.

Here are some specific suggestions and grantors that you might consider, tailored to support graduate students in various disciplines:\n\n1. **Fulbright Program**:\n   - Offers grants for graduate students to study, conduct research, or teach English abroad. This can be particularly relevant if your master&#x27;s program or career goals involve international aspects.\n\n2. **The Ford Foundation Fellowship Programs**:\n   - Provides fellowships to individuals pursuing research-based graduate study. The programs are designed to increase diversity among faculty in academia, so if your research aligns with that aim, this could be a potential source.\n\n3. **The American Association of University Women (AAUW)**:\n   - Offers fellowships and grants to women graduate students who are advancing their education or pursuing academic research. They have various programs that might be relevant depending on your field of study.\n\n4. **Scholarships.com and Fastweb**:\n   - These websites provide searchable databases of scholarships and grants. You can tailor searches to your specific needs, such as your study field, demographic factors, and more.\n\n5. **Rotary Foundation Global Grants**:\n   - Supports graduate-level coursework or research for one to four academic years. The grant can also be used to fund scholars whose academic plans align with one of Rotary\u2019s Areas of Focus, which include promoting peace, fighting disease, providing clean water, saving mothers and children, supporting education, and growing local economies.\n\n6. **GoGrad**:\n   - GoGrad.org specializes in helping graduate students find funding. They provide an extensive list of scholarships and grants, including many options that are field-specific.\n\nTo further your search, consider your specific field of study, any minority status, or special interest areas that grantors might want to support. Tailoring your search to these specifics can yield better results. Also, remember to check eligibility requirements closely and prepare a strong application, potentially with recommendations and a well-developed research proposal or study plan.

Here\u2019s a guide to help you get started:\n\n### 1. **Identify Your Needs and Eligibility**\n   - Determine the specific purpose for which you need the grant (e.g., education, business startup, research, personal emergency).\n   - Research grants that fit your needs and check if you meet the eligibility criteria.\n\n### 2. **Research Grant Opportunities**\n   - **Government Grants**: Visit websites like Grants.gov in the U.S., which lists available federal grants.\n   - **Non-Profit Organizations**: Look for foundations or non-profits that offer personal grants. Websites like Foundation Center (now Candid) provide databases of grants.\n   - **Local Government and Community Organizations**: Check with local government offices or community centers for available grants.\n\n### 3. **Prepare Your Application**\n   - **Gather Documentation**: Collect necessary documents such as identification, financial statements, and proof of eligibility.\n   - **Write a Proposal**: Clearly state your need, how the grant will be used, and why you are a deserving candidate. Include a budget if necessary.\n   - **Follow Instructions**: Ensure you follow the application guidelines precisely, including format, deadlines, and required attachments.\n\n### 4. **Submit the Application**\n   - Submit your application through the specified method (online, mail, or in-person).\n   - Keep copies of all submitted materials for your records.\n\n### 5. **Follow Up**\n   - After submission, monitor the status of your application.\n   - Be prepared to provide additional information if requested by the grantor.\n\n### 6. **Other Tips**\n   - **Networking**: Connect with people who have received grants or are involved in grant-giving organizations for advice and tips.\n   - **Persistence**: Applying for grants can be competitive, so don\u2019t get discouraged if you don\u2019t receive one on your first try. Keep applying to various grants.\n\nWould you like more detailed information on a specific type of grant or assistance with any of the steps?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "99c61804-2707-4d8c-88f9-4abdc31702c2", "request_id": "883658ba3eafbabe-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "99c61804-2707-4d8c-88f9-4abdc31702c2", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "9c0e1986-47ef-4d46-901c-cf52abc29213", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "84607d0f-0f19-4518-aa29-1a4b3cda59de", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "84607d0f-0f19-4518-aa29-1a4b3cda59de"}, {"title": "GPT-4 TTS Integration", "create_time": 1715638195.714418, "update_time": 1715638355.983699, "mapping": {"7b4964af-87fe-4aa4-8612-248470e2256d": {"id": "7b4964af-87fe-4aa4-8612-248470e2256d", "message": {"id": "7b4964af-87fe-4aa4-8612-248470e2256d", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa13b01-3ea2-47b7-93ab-58d51d9254a6", "children": ["aaa288d6-92d9-4544-b3ea-8b2618b63ed5"]}, "aaa13b01-3ea2-47b7-93ab-58d51d9254a6": {"id": "aaa13b01-3ea2-47b7-93ab-58d51d9254a6", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["7b4964af-87fe-4aa4-8612-248470e2256d"]}, "aaa288d6-92d9-4544-b3ea-8b2618b63ed5": {"id": "aaa288d6-92d9-4544-b3ea-8b2618b63ed5", "message": {"id": "aaa288d6-92d9-4544-b3ea-8b2618b63ed5", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715638195.717651, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["does chat gpt 4o have talking capabilities?

Explain why each is important when competing for a grant.\n\n\n\n\nIn program development, particularly in grant applications, it is essential to differentiate between the program&#x27;s purpose, goals, and objectives. These elements play a crucial role in presenting a well-constructed proposal to prospective funders. Therefore, it is imperative to have a clear understanding of these components and their significance in the context of program development.\n\n\n\n\nPurpose: A program&#x27;s purpose provides the foundational framework that sets the overall direction. It defines the broad aim of the program and answers why it exists. The purpose is essential in grant writing as it communicates the program&#x27;s core essence and justification to funders, helping them understand the overarching intent behind the initiative (Godwin et al., 1998).\n\n\n\n\nGoals: Goals are broad, general statements that articulate the desired outcomes the program aims to achieve in the long run. They map out the future and provide a measure of success. Goals are essential in grants because they demonstrate the strategic endpoints of the program, giving funders a clear picture of the intended impact and aligning with their interests and priorities (Godwin et al., 1998; Wilburn &amp; Wilburn, n.d.).\n\n\n\n\nObjectives: Objectives are specific, measurable steps that outline how the goals will be achieved. They are concise and detailed, often including specific targets and timelines. Objectives are crucial in grant proposals because they provide measurable benchmarks for evaluating the program&#x27;s success and accountability, ensuring that there are concrete criteria against which the program&#x27;s effectiveness can be assessed (Godwin et al., 1998).\n\n\n\n\nPart B: You are competing for a CLU Social Impact Innovation Fund grant. Your grant is to be compelling enough to earn an award. In one paragraph, describe the grant idea that you will use throughout the class.\n\nWith the goal of improving the overall well-being of society, I propose the creation of the &quot;Global Happiness Initiative Foundation&quot; (GHIF). The foundation is dedicated to improving the quality of life for individuals across the globe through increased access to education, healthcare, travel opportunities, and mental health resources (Backer &amp; Weiler, 2018; Gilbert &amp; Abdullah, 2004; Gray et al., 2019; Ross &amp; Wu, 1995). GHIF is committed to promoting long-term happiness and well-being, free from the limitations of health conditions. This initiative operates as a community and global cooperative effort, with an emphasis on inclusivity and universal benefit. By forging strategic partnerships and implementing innovative service delivery, GHIF aims to make a significant impact by transforming lives and fostering a more connected and joyful world.\n\n\n\n\nPart C: Define your program/idea with the following three details: purpose, goals, and objectives.\n\n\n\n\nPurpose: The purpose of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation is to enhance the overall well-being and happiness of individuals globally by providing unrestricted access to essential life-enhancing services such as education, healthcare, and mental wellness resources.\n\n\n\n\nGoals:\u00a0\n\u00a0Long-term Goal: To significantly increase the global population&#x27;s access to key well-being services, thereby improving quality of life and happiness.\nShort-term Goal: Establish and strengthen partnerships with local and international organizations to facilitate service delivery and reach a wider audience.\n\n\n\n\nObjectives:\n\u00a0Objective 1: By the end of the first year, launch educational programs in at least three countries, benefiting over 10,000 individuals.\nObjective 2: Within the first six months, partner with at least five major healthcare providers to offer comprehensive health services with an emphasis on preventive care and mental health.\nObjective 3: Develop and implement a scalable model for wellness travel that can be replicated across different regions. The model will be evaluated based on participant satisfaction and repeat engagement rates.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBacker, E., &amp; Weiler, B. (2018).

Content (15 points)\n- **Criterion**: Posts original and well-developed initial response that addresses the discussion question prompt; provides details, explanations, and examples; supports writing with course content (literature, readings, and media).\n- **Student Performance**: The student&#x27;s response is comprehensive and well-developed, addressing the difference between a program&#x27;s purpose, goals, and objectives clearly. They provide detailed explanations and examples, substantiating their points with references from existing literature. The response adheres to this criterion excellently, likely earning full points.\n\n### 2. Critical Analysis (10 points)\n- **Criterion**: Compares, contrasts, and/or integrates theory and course content with work environment or experience; analyzes or criticizes course materials or concepts; incorporates theory and/or practice to develop new ideas and ways of conceptualizing.\n- **Student Performance**: The student&#x27;s integration of theory from multiple sources and their application to the conceptualization of a new grant idea (Global Happiness Initiative Foundation) demonstrates good critical analysis. They show an understanding of how these concepts are applicable in real-world scenarios, suggesting a high score in this section.\n\n### 3. Clarity, Mechanics, and Organization (10 points)\n- **Criterion**: Demonstrates graduate-level writing with correct grammar, spelling, punctuation, and evidence of proofreading; structure of responses are clear, logical, and easy to follow.\n- **Student Performance**: The response is well-structured, logically ordered, and easy to follow, reflecting graduate-level writing proficiency. There are no apparent grammatical or spelling errors, and the use of academic language is appropriate, indicating that the student likely scored well in this area.\n\n### 4. APA Standards (5 points)\n- **Criterion**: Cites course content according to APA standards with in-text citations and references.\n- **Student Performance**: The student correctly uses APA formatting for citations and references, as evidenced by the detailed reference list and in-text citations. This suggests full compliance with this criterion.\n\n### 5. Participation: Responses to Peers Posts (10 points)\n- **Criterion**: Responds substantively to at least two classmates; builds on the discussion by adding own examples, course materials, asking questions, etc.\n- **Student Performance**: This criterion cannot be assessed from the provided information as it pertains to interaction with classmates&#x27; posts, which are not included in the description.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the provided discussion response and the rubric criteria, the student appears to have excelled in the categories of Content, Critical Analysis, Clarity, Mechanics, Organization, and APA Standards. Without information on participation responses to peers, we can&#x27;t evaluate that aspect. Assuming full marks in the other sections and given the high quality of the response, the student likely scored close to the maximum points available for the evaluated criteria."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa25b30-75cc-4466-aad8-8ea140df383a", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "882737fdb918ba91-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa25b30-75cc-4466-aad8-8ea140df383a", "children": ["96abfaea-c2bf-45b4-be32-92498c8ac47d"]}, "96abfaea-c2bf-45b4-be32-92498c8ac47d": {"id": "96abfaea-c2bf-45b4-be32-92498c8ac47d", "message": {"id": "96abfaea-c2bf-45b4-be32-92498c8ac47d", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715483947.397668, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [], "rebase_system_message": true, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null, "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fd62bfa2-86b6-4067-8b0c-c6aa72eaaaaa", "children": ["aaa21108-d3dd-4d47-aa47-5bbb6f2b4d69"]}, "aaa21108-d3dd-4d47-aa47-5bbb6f2b4d69": {"id": "aaa21108-d3dd-4d47-aa47-5bbb6f2b4d69", "message": {"id": "aaa21108-d3dd-4d47-aa47-5bbb6f2b4d69", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715483947.400418, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Part A: Describe the difference between a program&#x27;s purpose, goal, and objective.

In our reading it says, \u201cObjectives are the building blocks or steps towards achieving a program&#x27;s goals. Objectives are specific and concise statements that state who will make what change, by how much, where and by when\u201d (Wilburn). It is important to have all three because if someone is going to invest into your organization or give you money to make a difference they want to know the basic questions of when, where, what, who, why, and how. When you state your organization&#x27;s purpose, goals and objectives you answer these questions and these investors will be able to see and know where their money is going. \n\nPart B: You are competing for a CLU Social Impact Innovation Fund grant.

Millions of teens feel this everyday and they have no one or no where to turn to. Our organization&#x27;s goal is to create a safe environment and experience for teens to learn many important life skills and coping mechanisms so that they can reach their full potential in life. We will achieve this goal by creating a program where teens can go for 6 months to 2 years and travel the world while doing different humanitarian projects in many different countries. While they help many different people in lots of amazing places, they will learn many new skills that will give them the confidence they need to achieve their goals and dreams in life. This will be a safe place for teens to learn because they will not be forced to do anything and they will feel loved and accepted. All we ask of you is to grant us $500,000 as our starting cost to make this organization a reality. With your help we can turn these feelings of confusion, fear and discouragement into hope, encouragement and joy. \n\nPart C: Define your program/idea with the following three details: purpose, goals, and objectives.\n\nPurpose: Have a safe place where teens can learn different skills to reach their full potential and achieve their life goals and dreams. \n\nGoal: Have a program where teens can go for 6 months to 2 years and travel to different countries while doing different humanitarian projects in each country. Teach many different life skills and coping mechanisms such as communication, confidence, processing feelings and thoughts, and many more. \n\nObjectives: \n\nCreate the program: (hire staff, find different countries and humanitarian projects, receive finances, market program, accept teens, have teens travel and help people, figure out how to duplicate).  \nTalk with teens to figure out their needs. \nFigure out how to meet their needs\n \n\nResources \n\nWilburn, S., &amp; Wilburn, K.

grant writing process provides investigators with critical thinking, problem solving, and communication skills, crucial for personal and professional development. However, opportunities for junior faculty to learn these skills are highly variable. Thus, we developed a grant writing program to assist in the preparation of an NIH R proposal. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The R Club Grant Program was implemented in 2021 for junior faculty of the University of Cincinnati\u2019s College of Medicine and Center for Clinical &amp; Translational Science &amp; Training (CCTST). The program consists of a series of workshops (e.g., How to Craft a Specific Aims Page, How to Construct a Competitive R01 Proposal) utilizing examples of successful proposals and grant review criteria to demonstrate how to translate a conceptual framework into a research proposal (level 1). All participants can receive constructive feedback on a Specific Aims page from an experienced grant writer (level 2), and for a select cohort, the program provides comprehensive scientific content edits and iterative feedback on a full research proposal, with a focus on grantsmanship, presentation, and overall competitiveness (level 3). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Over three NIH grant cycles, the program to date has provided 38 early-career investigators with multi-level grant writing support. All participants attended the workshops and received supporting documents, 21 received feedback on a Specific Aims page, and 6 received one-on-one writing assistance on their full research proposal. Of the 6 investigators who received the greatest level of support, 3 have received NIH scientific review, with a 66.6% funding success rate for either an original (R01, n=1) or subsequent overlapping (R35, n=1) proposal. In a survey sent to workshop attendees, 100% of respondents (n=23) reported ( Strongly Agreed or Agreed ) that the training was a worthwhile investment in their professional development and 96% stated that they will be able to apply the knowledge and skills learned. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Initial evaluation measures suggest that grant writing support programs have great potential to enhance funding success rates. As the program evolves it will be crucial to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative feedback measures to ensure efforts are directed to the appropriate level(s) of service to maximize the funding success of our faculty.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jennifer Veevers&quot;,&quot;Patrick H.

In the future, more and more grant funded programs will be a necessary part of our work in student affairs. This manuscript offers basic tools for understanding best practices of grant writing and the principles that should guide student affairs personnel in grant writing endeavors. Financial constraints throughout academe create heightened attention on external sources of funds. While typically associated with faculty and research, grant writing represents a substantive way in which student affairs personnel can demonstrate their abilities as educators. In terms of professional development, student affairs staff members can benefit from collaboration in writing grants, managing the grants, and in conducting research associated with the project. Their insights to the cocurricular lives of students are a salient perspective that other segments of a campus can benefit from as the dialogue unfolds regarding a grant proposal. The nature of requests for proposals (RFPs) has changed in ways that encourage student affairs to participate actively. For example, many agencies now approach programmatic project ideas from a collaborative viewpoint of the campus, as opposed to non-collaborative, isolated projects. In addition, the evaluation and research components now required in many RFPs necessitate a perspective on the students&#x27; holistic experiences, rather than data such as grade point average or retention rates. The agencies are equally concerned with questions of \\&quot;how\\&quot; and \\&quot;why,\\&quot; as they are with questions of \\&quot;what\\&quot; and \\&quot;how much.\\&quot; Even if student affairs professionals do not take the lead on a grant project, their collaboration with other campus components will become more vital to ensure that co-curricular concerns are addressed. Currently, a dearth of literature exists regarding the involvement of student affairs professionals involved in grant writing endeavors. Guiding Principles Begin with an Idea To receive funding, a proposal must demonstrate fit between the institutional strategic plan, the goals of the sponsor, and the objectives of the project. The strongest proposals demonstrate a rigorous alignment with guidelines of the sponsor. Even an idea with a great deal of merit and research will not be funded if the program goals do not align with those of the sponsor. A writing team should critically examine sponsors that possibly align with a project idea and institution. Many sponsors will post past awardees, including institution, name of project, and contact information. Identify Sponsors Funding sources for grants include federal (e.g., U.S. Department of Education at www.ed.gov) and state agencies (e.g., State Department of Human Services), private foundations (e.g., John and Catherine T. McArthur Foundation at www.macfdn.org, Coca-Cola\u00ae at www2.coca-cola.com/foundation), and professional organizations (e.g., SACSA at www.sacsa.org). Campuses may also be members of national search agencies that will research sponsors for a particular idea or niche. When the proposal is ready to be submitted, the team may choose to submit it to one agency or to more than one. If the proposal is accepted by more than one agency, the campus must choose one and decline the other. Write with a Team Once a project has been generally defined and possible sponsors have been identified, a writing team should be established that is representative of the project stakeholders. The team leader may be pre-determined or designated by the group. For an effective writing team, the project requires personnel familiar with the institutions or departments involved and who also have authority to commit resources on behalf of their units. Once the team is assembled, the members must read through the RFP carefully to identify the requisite components of the proposal. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Bonnie V.

As the leading section of the proposal, the specific-aims section serves as a 1-page synopsis that needs to gain the attention and interest of the reviewers. It must present a compelling case for the importance of the proposed work and provide a convincing rationale and evidence that you and your team are the best people to carry out the project. Developing the specific-aims page is usually the first stage of the grant writing process, as it provides an overview of the proposal and research directions. Furthermore, it can be instrumental in getting external feedback from program officers, collaborators, and others as the grant develops. The process of writing the Specific Aims page requires that one touch on each of the elements that comprise the scoring criteria of the proposal (eg, significance, innovation, investigator(s), approach, and environment) and succinctly introduce all the main topics that will be addressed in the application, but focus especially on the knowledge gap and the importance of filling it, the central hypothesis and the aims that will address it, and the overall impact of the work. This page sets a clear framework for writing the rest of the grant. In this article, we present a set of recommendations and guidelines on how to utilize an algorithmic approach to develop the specific-aims page, what elements to include, and how to maximize its value to create a competitive grant.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

For the new faculty member applying the first time for outside research funding, it is important to seek help from experienced and more senior colleagues, especially those who are actively serving on NIH Study Sections. It is a good idea to remember that the individuals reviewing applications are some of our busiest scientists. The job of grant review is clearly an added assignment that they willingly donate their time to and one needs to consider this when writing a grant application. Anything that can be done to make the reviewer&#x27;s job easier can only help the application. Brevity, clarity, and organization are essential to a good application. As has been repeatedly mentioned, one of the major application weaknesses sited is a lack of focus, especially in the presentation of the Research Plans. For the new applicant, it is very helpful to plan enough time for completion of the application so that it could be reviewed by others thoroughly knowledgeable in this particular area. Once the application is submitted, the applicant should take advantage of opportunities to interact with the Executive Secretary of the Study Section to which the grant is assigned. Every institution&#x27;s research office maintains a book identifying all of the Study Sections, the current members of the Study Section, and the Chairman. The assignment of the grant application to a particular study is an administrative one occurring at NIH upon receipt of the grant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Start by surrounding yourself with a successful mentor and accompanying team with a good track record. Get organized, select clear goals and objectives to your project. Once the foundation for the grant is set, begin by generating a robust hypothesis. Once your hypothesis is clearly defined, you should contact the project officer of the specific grant for which you are applying; they can help identify if the proposal meets an area of need. The basic components of a grant include the following: the face page, which highlights the key contributors; followed by table of contents; abstract; biographical sketches, which are minicurriculum vitae; budget; research plan, which is composed mostly of background, significance, and specific aims; and lastly, references cited. Be sure to follow specific formatting. Use resources including the internet to find an appropriate grant. Finally, given the confines of a busy surgical practice and the significant amount of work necessary to complete a grant, it is essential that the work begins early and well in advance of the proposed deadline.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jason T.

It is based on sound planning, development, implementation and evaluation strategies. An important component of the grant/proposal writing process is to address not only the needs of the organization, but also the needs of the funding source. The opportunity to capture your intended funder&#x27;s attention is limited, usually to the first few sentences. Make the most of the opportunity by concentrating on the opening sentences of the proposal. Make no mistake -fewer words make a great impact.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C. Zagury&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:1995,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Complementary Health Practice Review&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/grant-writing-uncertain-road-funding-zagury/dfd2ef57b3745112bb9ba9309863aaea/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1177/153321019500100214&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;139 - 143&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:6},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;The art of grant writing&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;How many scientists, while writing a grant proposal, realize that they are producing a marketing document? The answer is, not enough, but the ones who do understand that they are selling their ideas and skills to the grant reviewers are the well-funded ones. The ability to market your ideas is the most critical feature of the art of grant writing.Marketing your research plan of course requires that you have a good idea, one that is creative, innovative, exciting and do-able. In clinical medicine or engineering, ideas might also be judged on their potential to lead to a pragmatic application. And, from the grant giver&#x27;s standpoint, a good idea has another important attribute. The grant giver&#x27;s goal is to fund work that furthers their mission. A good idea is one that&#x27;s in line with that mission. It came as a surprise to me several years ago when I realized that the main aim of the National Institutes of Health or the Medical Research Council is to not fund my research. Thus, the most important homework you can do, before writing the first word of a grant application, is to match your priorities with those of one or more grant givers.One of the most important things you can do to ensure that your writing is clear and focused is to get experienced grant writers to review drafts of your proposal. These should include an expert in your field, a good scientific editor (especially important if you&#x27;re writing in a language other than your mother tongue) and an intelligent non-specialist. A grant-savvy scientist in another discipline is best qualified to catch fuzzy writing and jargon. Finally, choose reviewers who have the time and who care enough about you and your career to do a careful review. Your department chairman might have the inclination but does he or she have the time?After 20 years of grant writing, I can still produce wordy, unfocused first draftsUnderstanding what reviewers look for is critical to writing a successful grant application. Try to put yourself in the reviewer&#x27;s shoes. The typical member of a review panel for a government granting agency is a 40-something full professor, faced with his or her own grants, teaching, committees, editorial responsibilities, graduate students, mortgage payments, rebelling teenagers, aging parents, mildewed roses, and so on. These reviewers, always pressed for time and possibly not experts in your field, want to see your main ideas or points at the beginning of the grant application and also near the front of each section.It&#x27;s worth thinking about the way most of us read a scientific paper when you write a grant. Most people read the abstract first, to get an overview of the whole, and the discussion next, to get to the main ideas and conclusions. Reviewers read grant applications with this same attitude. Meet their expectations by providing an abstract or summary that answers the key questions: what are you going to do? why is it worth doing? where will it lead? and (briefly) how are you going to do it?Preparing a grant application differs in several important ways from writing a scientific paper, although we often subconsciously adopt the same style for our grant applications. If you are asked to write a background or rationale section, begin with an overview of the questions or problems you will address and why they are important. The experimental methods section should start with an overview of the experimental design or plan, followed by the details of the methods or techniques. Jumping directly into the methods suggests you care more about techniques than ideas.Choosing the right grant giver, having a good idea that you develop in a clear, focused proposal, and understanding the grant review process enhance your chances but do not guarantee funding. What happens if you don&#x27;t succeed the first time? I find encouragement in the saying \u2018The only people who don&#x27;t make mistakes are the ones who don&#x27;t do anything\u2019. The best scientists occasionally write unfunded proposals, and sometimes dramatically new ideas are harder to get funded than \u2018pretty good\u2019 ones. If your grant fails to get funded the first time, don&#x27;t quit. Revise and resubmit.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Coley &amp; Cynthia A. Scheinberg&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Coley and Scheinberg\u2019s Proposal Writing: Effective Grantsmanship is a strong example of the kind of resource I recommend all MSWs have on their bookshelf: a clear and concise primer on the process of writing a strong grant proposal. The book clearly describes the nuts and bolts of proposal writing, highlights major pitfalls often encountered, and offers sound advice on ways to increase the probability of funding success. The book begins by offering an overview of the major types of funding proposals (government/foundation/corporate) and outlines the major components of a proposal, all along the way offering the reader useful suggestions. In the case of a co-written proposal, for example, the authors recommend assigning a point person responsible for pulling pieces together in time to meet submission deadlines. In the case of a nascent organization, they suggest exploring the possibility of a partnership with a more established agency that might bring more credibility to the initiative. Chapter two offers a brief (and not terribly informative) discussion of the usefulness of technology in finding and evaluating potential funders and sources of data on both the intervention and community. Future editions of the book might highlight AmericanFactFinder, which makes accessing community-level census and American Community Survey data relatively easy. The authors then turn to a discussion of the importance of understanding the agency (to identify strengths and weaknesses), the funder (to identify priorities), and the community (to identify goodness-of-fit). These elements are important not simply for the purposes of writing a strong proposal, but also more critically for effective program development that meets the needs of the community in an accessible manner. Before seeking funding, the authors challenge readers to ask, \u201cIs the service the right one for the client?\u201d (p. 29). After laying the groundwork, the book discusses the major components of the proposal: the needs statement, the goals and objectives, the project narrative, the evaluation plan, the budget, and \u201cfinishing touches\u201d such as the cover letter. These chapters are strong because they mix description of the form and function of the components with advice for strengthening&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;H.

However, few articles have evaluated the impact of grant writing workshops on NIH grant submission and award rates. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The K Writing program was developed by the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) at the University of Michigan. Since 2012, 435 scholars have participated in the program. The MICHR K Writing program is a three-part workshop series that prepares scholars by providing them with guidelines to write all sections of a career development grant application. Each session focuses on different sections of the K award proposal. During the workshop sessions, participants break into small groups and exchange drafts of their proposal sections and receive peer critique and feedback from senior faculty facilitators who have experience with NIH study sections. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Between 2012-2018, 273 scholars participated and 57% were female. Our two primary outcomes of interest are submission rates and success rates (the number of grants awarded divided by the number of applications). We plan to examine the effects of several characteristics, including number of sessions attended, cohort year, and faculty vs. postdoctoral status. We will also examine whether there were differences in submission and success rates between female and male researchers and between underrepresented minority scholars and those who identified as white or Asian. Lastly, we will report submission and success rates for each grant mechanism and compare them to the national averages. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Obtaining external research funding is an important part of a faculty career, especially at its early stages. This research has important implications for the design of similar programs intended to increase submission and success rates for federal grant applications.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Phillip A.

Educators must raise their own funds to meet their needs for research and teaching, so they are compelled to write proposals for grants. Grants and other funding are increasingly becoming difficult to obtain. To be competitive for funding, an educator must submit a strong proposal that creates a good first impression to the reviewer. A proposal that is well written, clear, and easy for the reviewer to read and understand generally has a better chance of being funded than one that is poorly written. Since many engineering educators have little background in writing, this paper gives guidelines for creating a strong proposal to prospective authors. General appearance of the proposal, including graphs, figures, and charts, is an important part of writing a successful grant. Common errors in writing are included, and basic rules for most frequently misused grammar are given with a discussion of words, sentence structure, and paragraph organization. General references that can be used in preparation of proposals are included. The various sections of a proposal, such as the budget, are reviewed with information on types of material to include in each. Additionally, general advice for fust time authors is included. Following these basic guidelines will aid in the writing of a s~cc=ssful grant proposal. What Is A Grant? A grant is an award of money for an idea or project. education, etc. Grants may cover all costs associated with a defray administrative costs at the university (indirect costs). Grants are given for research, training, service, project (direct costs) or may include money to help Granting agencies include the government, which is the m-ost abundant source of funds; privat; foundations, which are g;ne;ally for specific int;rests; and business and industry, which often require contracts and carefully monitor the research or project to see that the business\u2019 goals are being met. A successful grant writer is one who has a good projector research idea, has goals that are consistent with the granting agency, has carefully thought through the project plan, and has a strong, well-written proposal. Even though the project or research idea maybe outstanding, the granting agency must have the same goals before a grant will be awarded. Before spending time and effort writing and submitting a proposal, the writer should check to be sure the granting agency or business is interested in the research idea or project and for any written instructions along with deadlines for submission of the proposal.1 Sources of Sup~or[ A search for money must start with an idea for research or for the use of the requested money. A knowledge of the sources of money for education and research is basic to obtaining funding to meet the educator\u2019s needs. Many universities have an Office for Sponsored Research or an Office of Grants and ?$iiiw) 1996 ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings \u2018.@lHH_..\u2019 . P ge 131.1 Contracts. The research office may publish a monthly bulletin of available grants, maintain a list of granting agencies, and/or list grants given by the university. Another excellent resource is the university library where one can find various information services which provide details about grants or contracts from the federal, state, and local governments, business and industry, intrauniversity funds, and other sources. Also, the Internet and computer services such as e-mail provide information on available grants from many sources. To help prospective grant writers write a successful proposal, numerous workshops and guides are available and can be located either in the library or through computer sources.2 Writimz A Successful Prot)osal A successful grant proposal is one that receives funding regardless of the importance of the projector research. Although most submitted proposals present good, solid ideas, all can not be funded. Proposals based on weak ideas for research or projects generally are not funded. Although a poorly written proposal maybe funded if the idea is truly outstanding and the investigator has excellent credentials, most proposals that are poorly written are rarely funded. The successful proposals are those that can be sold to the granting agency. A proposal that is well written and easy for the reviewer to read and understand is more likely to receive funding. The review process generally consists of assigning the proposal to primary reviewers and secondary reviewers. The primary reviewers will look at the proposal and give it a full review in most cases; however, secondary reviewers often glance through the proposals and look only for major details. Two sections of a proposal all reviewers concentrate on are the budget justification and the biographical sketches that give information about the prospective researchers. Therefore, the budget and the biographical sketches must show what the writer wants all the reviewers to see in a glance. All sections of the grant should be easy to read, and major points should be prominent for the reviewers.3 The appearance of the proposal is of utmost importance since the first impression the proposal has for the reviewer is crucial to the full review. General rules for the appearance of a successful proposal follow.1\u20193$4\u20195 000 Use a word processor or desk top publisher to prepare the proposal. 000 Each page should have the same appearance, i.e. same fonts, printer. cwo Each page should be an original, not a photocopy of an older document. mm Charts and graphs with proper titles add to the quality of the proposal. 000 Indent and use headings and double spacing between sections when possible to make the proposal easier to read. OOO Do not fill every possible space with words; use recommended font size (12 if one is not specified). cwo Follow all guidelines for format of the proposal. Do not deviate from page restrictions, section order, and other requirements. 000 Use titles and diagrams to increase the ease of review. 000 Double space between paragraphs. mm Make sure there are no TYPOS or other inconsistencies in the paper. Good writing is concise and to the point; present only essential material. Parts of A l?ro~osal Although each funding agency will have specific requirements for grants, most proposals will include the following sections: abstract; problem statement, rationale, and specific aims; background and significance procedure, research plan, or experimental design and methods; budget and budget justification; literature cited, and biographical sketches of key personnel. If there are consultants or other contractual arrangements, letters from each indicating the willingness to participate should be included.1\u20193 ~hx~~ 1996 ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings \u2018?+,~yy: P ge 131.2 Abstract The abstract may be the only section of a proposal that some reviewers read. The abstract needs to be concise and attract the attention of the reviewers. A brief overview of the proposed project with a summary of the specific aims of the project should be included. Do not make the abstract a table of contents by listing the sections of the grant. Problem Statementor Rationale The problem statement is as important as the abstract and should contain the idea that is to be developed. The objectives or goals for the project should be clear. A reviewer should be able to read this section within three minutes and understand the significance of the project.

Backizround and Simificance The background section contains reference to prior work in the area of the proposed project. The section should contain relevant information to illustrate why the project is important, that it is feasible, and how the investigator is capable of completing the project. A diagram to summarize related work and show how the proposed work can be completed will help the reviewer understand the significance of the project. Procedure This section of the proposal includes a logical, organized, and detailed explanation of the procedures that will b used to accomplish the objectives of the project. The procedure section may include a technical plan and a management plan. A technical plan includes highly specific details of the methods, tests, instrumentation, quality control, materials, design approach, and special techniques. A management plan includes a description of key personnel with their qualifications to accomplish the goals of the proposal. Also, include organization support or collaborative effort; resources, such as equipment, space, laboratories; and schedule for completion of the proposal in the procedure section. Tables or diagrams used to simplify the explanation are welcomed by reviewers. Figures and Tables Whenever possible, include figures or tables to communicate complicated ideas and help the reviewer through the proposal. Use attractive figures and tables that are clear and easy to understand without reading long explanations. Numerical data presented in tables or figures are generally faster to scan and easier to visualize than when presented in text form. Tables can be used to present much information in a relatively small amount of space. Figur&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;John H.

Although most schools receive funding from a variety of sources, the monies are not always available to fund special projects and programs. Most school personnel are not aware of all the ways to allocate resources and develop long-range plans to meet a school&#x27;s assessed needs. Developing a proposal-writing team at your school is a good technique for bringing school plans and personnel together, for learning to maximize local resources and for finding additional funding for supporting long-range programs. * The Art of Grant Writing Grant writing is a cross between technical writing and creative writing. Money is given to fund educational programs by funding sources with a pre-determined philosophical idea of the programs and projects they are willing to back. Funders also determine the procedures they want you to follow before awarding money. Therefore, if you intend to be funded, you need to make sure your school&#x27;s problems can be solved by the funding source you are soliciting and that you support your program with strong quantitative and qualitative data. When a school finds a funder that meets its program&#x27;s needs, the proposals should tell a story about the problems at the school, offer ideas on how to solve these problems, provide plans on how this will happen, and describe the necessary costs and personnel to make this project come true. * Where Does Money Come From? My father taught me that \\&quot;money does not grow on trees,\\&quot; but then again he did not live long enough to see money fall from machines on walls. For successful grant writers, however, money does grow on trees. It&#x27;s easier to get money when you have money, which is, of course, the \\&quot;American Way\\&quot; of doing business. Grant monies come from a wide variety of resources that include federal funds, state funds, private donations, foundations, local businesses, fund-raising activities and your own school graduates. At the end of this article, I have listed a variety of places to look for major resources, but remember that any resource, no matter how small, can help fund your program. It is often easier to collect $100 from 100 people than $10,000 from one source. The 100 people will only require a thank-you letter, while the major source may require extensive paperwork. Most companies have to give some money away as part of their tax structure. Your job is convincing them to give the money to you. Businesses are always eager to provide funding support that will makes them look better in the eyes of their community. Help them by writing a proposal in which you can all take pride. * The Task of Grant Writing Grant writing is not difficult, but it is hard work and very time consuming. Any educated person can write a successful grant, or you can find a grant writer to coach you through the process. The final grant, however, should express the needs of the students and the passion of the school to change education in terms of student needs. First of all, there are no generic grants. Grantors will all ask their questions a little bit differently and no two final grants will look alike. That does not mean you cannot use information from one grant to support another. In fact, schools that receive multi-grants usually stick to one set of solutions and continue to request funding from different sources for the same basic program. Federal and state grants will require a multi-paged proposal plus district and local documentation pages. Foundation and corporate funding sources prefer shorter proposals, usually a cover letter and a two-page proposal plus tax and budgetary information. Solicitation to local businesses may only require a letter of introduction and intent. However, no matter which type of funding source you seek, the information that you will provide is fairly consistent. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;E.

Next, schedule brainstorming sessions with everyone who\u2019ll be involved in the process. At these sessions, participants can identify statements of need and develop a clear, concise description of the proposed project. Also determine goals, timetables, and how to eval uate the effectiveness of the project during these initial planning sessions. Include industry partners from the community in the grant-planning process because letters of commitment can easily be obtained from those initially involved. The purpose of a letter of commitment is to express the institution\u2019s support of the project. This letter should convince reviewers of the grant application (the grantor) that the project will be successful. Include the project title, a brief summary of the project, and all partners and collaborators in the letter. Show your enthusiasm here! Explore sources of grant funding early. Resources include the federal government, state and local agencies, and professional organizations. A request for proposal (RFP), the primary source of information about each grant, provides an outline of criteria for development of the grant proposal. Consult it early and often to meet the requirements of the granting agency for the proposal. Generally, each grant proposal includes the following sections: cover letter and summary, statement of need, project objectives, project methods and design, evaluation, budget narrative, and proposal appendix.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

While collaborative partnerships have long been encouraged, mandatory collaboration, in which the type of partner organizations (e.g., workforce development boards, K-12 schools, non-profits, community or faith-based groups, industry or businesses, etc.) are designated by the sponsoring agency, has not traditionally been required. However, many Federal departments recognize that in order to achieve the greatest return on the public investment that grants represent, a comprehensive solution that taps into the variety of resources available within a given community must be encouraged (Baker, Homan, Schonhoff &amp; Kreuter, 1999). This commitment to protect taxpayer interests is set forth as part of a Federal agency&#x27;s strategic plan, and reflects its priorities through integration of these interests with its mission and program authorities. Mandatory grant collaboration means that collaborative writing has become a necessary skill for those charged with drafting the proposal document. The opportunity for collaboration presents many advantages for writers such as maximum input, checks and balances, access to a depth of experience, resources, joint knowledge, error reduction/achieving a more accurate text, and potentially, a higher quality document (Appel, 2005; Noel &amp; Robert, 2004). However, these benefits hinge upon the ability of the collaborative group as a whole to carry out interactions and subsequent writing tasks effectively. This is often simpler in theory than in practice, given that the turnaround time for many requests for grant proposals is now 30 to 45 days from announcement in the Federal Register. When such collaborative structures are not already in place (i.e., \\&quot;... an alliance among individuals linked by a common problem in order to develop a viable solution for addressing that problem\\&quot;) (Crawley, Hughes, Dopke &amp; Dolan, 2007, p. 184), creating an innovative program that represents a true collaboration of organizational resources and ongoing reciprocity can be difficult to achieve within these constraints. Moreover, even when underlying structures for collaboration are in place, the communication required to orchestrate a diverse team through a successful grant writing endeavor, and subsequent implementation (if funding is awarded), tends to be challenging from the outset for a number of reasons. For instance, group members from representative organizations may play diverse roles and/ or have differing levels of influence within and outside of their organization (Bacon, 1990), leading to dissention in assignment of tasks. Partnering organizations also do not necessarily share similar missions and organizational acculturation (Palmeri, 2004), which dictate how and when work is accomplished. The group&#x27;s ability to mediate these, and other differences, therefore likely plays a significant role in whether or not they can achieve a successful outcome. In addition, \\&quot;because collaborative work often places unique demands on participants --requiring some unfamiliar attitudes and behaviors and a wide range of specialized skills--collaborative capacity is greatly influenced by both the existing skills, knowledge and attitudes members bring to the table and efforts taken to build, support, and access this capacity\\&quot; (Foster-Fishman, Berkowitz &amp; Lounsbury, 2001, p. 243). In other words, not only is it essential to strategically select the group&#x27;s members, as each individual&#x27;s skills, talents and work habits must provide an added value to the whole, but the ability of the group to communicate and work together to achieve its collective purpose also largely depends on how effectively its dynamics are organized and managed to create conditions that promote collaboration. Ensuring the success of collaborative grant writing endeavors is of utmost importance for organizations seeking Federal grant funding. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;L.

Much postgraduate training focuses on the later elements and gives short shrift to the earlier ones. This article attempts to fill that gap by discussing a pivotal element of the funding process: preparing effective grant applications. In addition to discussing the fundamental features of the pivotal sections of a standard National Institutes of Health (NIH) R-series application (see \u201cTypes of Grant Programs\u201d on the Web site of the NIH Office of Extramural Research for a complete list of NIH-sponsored grant programs1), the sections below outline measures preliminary to the actual grant writing process, rhetorical perspectives and tactics useful to grant writers, the NIH grant application review and scoring process, and the importance of revision and resubmission.\\n\\nGrant applications (hereafter I often use the common shorthand \u201cgrant\u201d to mean \u201cgrant application\u201d) are, of course, judged not only on the text, tables, and figures reviewed by the funding agency but also on everything that stands behind the document: the ideas, the researchers and their collective experience, and the researchers\u2019 host institutions. A successful grant must persuade reviewers that all of these bases have been covered and that the probability of delivering fruitful findings is high. Thus, a necessary preliminary step in planning any research project is to secure the enthusiastic support of department heads, deans, and managers. Demonstrating that the proposed research has institutional support (in the form of researcher time, support staff, physical space, access to necessary equipment, etc) reassures reviewers that the research will be nurtured in a propitious environment. Second, assembling the best team possible to prepare the grant and to accomplish the work is imperative. This \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;D.

In these days of budget shortfalls, universities are asking their faculty to take on additional teaching loads, often at the expense of time that could be dedicated to grant writing, just when the financial gains to the university from external grants would be most valuable. This provides an interesting challenge to sponsored program officers: how to encourage writing grant proposals and develop grantsmanship in faculty, especially new faculty, during these tough financial times. The Sponsored Project and Research Center (SPARC) Office at the University of Northern Colorado has developed an innovative program designed to encourage and support grant writing activities in young faculty. The Sponsored Project Development Award (SPDA) Fellowship Program is a two-year fellowship designed for new faculty. Faculty members submit applications to the SPARC Office, which then reviews the applications and selects a group of SPDA Fellows to begin the fellowship together as a cohort. The Fellowship makes certain demands on the fellows during the two-year program, but it also provides the fellows with a variety of incentives to aid in their grant writing development. The Application Form Cover Page, which describes the requirements and benefits of the program, is included as Appendix A. Note that both the department chair and the dean must sign off on the application, thereby guaranteeing both their financial and logistical support for the fellow while he/she participates in the program. In Spring 2003, the SPARC Office chose a cohort of seven faculty to participate in the SPDA Program. This paper contains a description of how the SPARC Office developed the SPDA Program and garnered support for the program from the university administration. It also contains direct feedback on aspects of the SPDA Program from the seven current fellows including information on the diversity of backgrounds represented by the fellows, perceptions of the pros and cons of the program, and suggestions for improvement. Conception and Support for the SPDA Program The SPARC Office at the University of Northern Colorado developed the Sponsored Project Development Award Fellowship Program as one piece of its internal grants program. Begun in the fall of 2001, the goal was to increase the number of faculty members who were writing successful grant proposals. The design for the Fellowship Program was an amalgamation of ideas garnered from a study of other institutions&#x27; faculty development and internal grants programs and from professional presenters at grant-writing workshops. The method was to bring in ten young faculty members with a desire to become involved in grant proposal writing, to provide them with a research development account, and to involve them, as a cohort, in a year-long series of intensive and hands-on development activities related to grantsmanship and proposal writing. The goal was that when these individuals became successful at getting grants, they would then go on to mentor others. Funding for the program came from the portion of indirect cost recovery retained by SPARC for faculty development. In addition, each of the six deans was asked to contribute $500 from their college toward a research development account for each Fellow. The budget for the program was $40,000, or $4,000 per Fellow, to cover the costs of proposal writing workshops, travel to Washington, visits to mentors, research development accounts of $2,000 per fellow (in addition to the $500 from the deans), and a variety of other development meetings and activities. To encourage buy-in of the program at the college level, each dean was asked to nominate the Fellows from his or her college.

With funding-success rates declining steadily [1], ensuring sufficient resources to sustain a research program has become an uncertain proposition for many scientists and clinicianinvestigators. Grants get funded (or not) for many reasons, but I think most grants go to research teams that funding agencies believe contain a high degree of expertise and ability. Therefore, when writing a research grant, it is critical to define who will be on the team. All research grants are submitted by a Principal Investigator (PI), but there may be many co-PIs and collaborators involved. These team members can be fellow researchers, methodologists, clinical experts, statisticians, and sometimes even patient representatives. The more-developed the research team, the better the odds of success. Put in this context, it is critical for PIs not to write their grants alone. Grants written by one person read like they were written by one person, and not by the team they represent. One person (often the PI) can formulate a research idea, but the plan should derive from discussions with colleagues and collaborators. Indeed, a research grant proposal should include the voices of all of the team members. That said, it can be challenging not only to make sure that all the appropriate voices are heard, but that the final grant maintains a cohesive and flowing narrative. To achieve this balance, I suggest starting with an outline, and inviting the whole team to comment on it early in the grant-writing process. At this stage, team members can also decide which section of the grant most suits their expertise. For example, the statistician can write the sample-size calculation and statistical plan, while the team\u2019s methodologists can focus on the sections falling within his or her purview. For clinical research, not surprisingly, the clinician-scientists (often including the PI) typically tackle the background and rationale sections of the grant. The approach to this stage seems logical to the point of being obvious. However, there are hidden challenges related to individual schedules, expectations, and habits that can impede the progress of the initial grant-writing steps. One way to handle these potential challenges is to arrange for a half-day or full-day meeting of all investigators in which the overall theme of the grant and the individual team member assignments are clearly laid out, including the specific timelines to be met. An inperson meeting allows the investigators to become familiar with one A note from the Editor-in-Chief: We are pleased to present the next installment of \u2018\u2018Pearls\u2019\u2019, a column in Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research.

Anderson\nGioved\u00ec9 mag alle 23:21\nA program\u2019s purpose, goal, and objective are distinct concepts that serve different roles in project planning and execution\n\nPurpose: The purpose provides the reason for doing something or justifies the desired results. It essentially represents intentions and sets the direction of the program. For example, a program\u2019s purpose could be to &quot;Run a business that will benefit the owners, provide employment opportunities, while attending to the needs and demands of the public through quality products and services&quot;. The purpose of a program helps grant reviewers understand why the program is necessary and what it intends to achieve. It provides the framework that sets the direction of the program.\n\n \n\nGoals: A goal is a general statement describing the desired results. It represents aspiration or sets future directions or destinations. Goals define what you want to achieve at a broad level. They set a direction without specifics on how to get there. For instance, the goal could be to &quot;Increase revenues and profits within five years&quot;. Goals give grant reviewers a clear idea of what the program intends to accomplish in the long term. They help reviewers assess whether the program aligns with the funding organization\u2019s mission and priorities.\n\nObjectives: as stated by Wilburn and Wilburn, \u201cObjectives are the building blocks or steps towards achieving a program&#x27;s goals. Objectives are specific and concise statements that state who will make what change, by how much, where and by when\u201d.  Objectives represent concrete actions needed to achieve the aspirations or steps required to reach predetermined destinations. They are very specific, time-bound activities that outline the exact steps required to achieve a goal. Objectives break large goals down into manageable parts. An example of an objective could be to &quot;Reduce operational costs by streamlining functions and processes&quot;. Objectives provide specific, measurable actions that will be taken to achieve the program\u2019s goals. They allow grant reviewers to see exactly how the program plans to achieve its goals, making it easier to assess the feasibility and potential impact of the program.\n\n \n\n \n\nGrant Proposal: Enhancing Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations\n\nInvictus Home Healthcare is a nonprofit social enterprise dedicated to providing high-quality home healthcare services to underserved populations, including veterans, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and those who are geographically distant from traditional healthcare facilities. Our mission is to ensure that every individual has access to compassionate and personalized care in the comfort of their own homes. In pursuit of this mission, we are requesting funding to support the expansion of our home healthcare business. With the grant funds, we aim to enhance our service offerings, increase our reach to more communities in need, and improve the overall quality of care provided to our clients.\n\n \n\nPurpose:\n\nAccess to healthcare remains a significant challenge for many vulnerable populations, including veterans, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. Factors such as limited mobility, financial constraints, and geographic isolation often prevent these individuals from receiving the care they need. Invictus Home Healthcare was established to address these barriers by bringing healthcare services directly to the doorsteps of those in need. Our team of skilled healthcare professionals provides a wide range of services, including medical care, assistance with daily activities, medication management, and emotional support. Despite our efforts, there is still a considerable unmet need for home healthcare services, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Many individuals continue to face difficulties accessing essential healthcare services, leading to exacerbated health conditions and diminished quality of life.\n\n \n\nGoal:\n\nProvide access to high-quality compassionate and personalized home healthcare services to underserved populations, including veterans, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and those who are geographically distant from traditional healthcare facilities in the comfort of their own homes.\n\n \n\n Objectives:\n\nExpand Service Offerings: Develop specialized programs tailored to the unique needs of our target populations, including mental health support for veterans and adaptive care for individuals with disabilities.\nIncrease Outreach and Engagement: Launch outreach initiatives to raise awareness of our services and reach more individuals in need, particularly in rural and underserved communities.\nEnhance Care Quality: Invest in staff training, technology, and infrastructure improvements to ensure the highest standards of care delivery and client satisfaction.\nFoster Collaboration: Strengthen partnerships with local healthcare providers, community organizations, and government agencies to create a seamless continuum of care for our clients.\nA clear purpose, well-defined goals, and specific objectives are crucial for a successful grant application. They help convey the program\u2019s intentions, planned actions, and desired outcomes, making it easier for grant reviewers to assess the program\u2019s potential for success.\n\n \n\n \n\nReference:\n\n \n\nGodwin, T.

The book is edited by Laura Gitlin, Ph.D., and Kevin Lyons, Ph.D., whose wide experiences during the last 20 years have prepared them for this endeavor. In fact, the first edition of this book (1996), edited by Dr. Gitlin, was widely adopted and was a top-selling textbook at Springer Publishing Company. In the preface of the updated edition, the authors identify the niche market for this book. It is specifically designed and written for health and human services professionals in academic and practice settings who are either inexperienced grant writers or those who have had some success but would like to expand their knowledge and become more competent in obtaining external support. The 320-page book fulfills this goal. It is easy to read and provides the reader with an excellent overview of the grant writing process. The book is carefully organized into six parts: the perspective of the funding agencies and the grantee, writing the proposal, models for proposal development, life after a proposal submission, and receiving the grant award. Chapter 1 introduces the language of grantsmanship including 14 common terms. Important information is presented in a clear and concise manner in the text, boxes, and chapter summary. For example, the components of a professional growth strategy are displayed in Box 1-2, and each component is carefully detailed for the novice, intermediate, advanced, and expert researcher. Figure 1-1 displays the research trajectory from novice to expert and is a valuable tool for the reader and for faculty who are teaching research courses. Chapter 2 describes the current funding environment and how to identify potential sources of funding for health and human services professionals. In Part II, the reader is introduced to ways of identifying a novel idea and matching it to a funding opportunity. Box 3-1 clearly outlines \u201cwhat is hot and what is not\u201d (p. 61). Once a promising idea appears to match with the interests of a funding agency, the authors urge the researcher to learn more about the policies and&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A. M.

If there is going to be a concerted effort to develop innovative strategies to reduce health disparities, input from the community and behavioral scientists can and should be included in this approach and narrative. Grant writing provides one vehicle to express the narrative and to provide a means to fund research and programs within clinic-based and community settings. This paper describes a four-step inquiry process to guide healthcare professionals with varying degrees of clinical and scholarship interests through the grant writing process. They include: (1) Why write grants (motivations), (2) what is the area of focus? (Interests), (3) whom should be on the project? (partnerships), and (4) what needs to happen next to move the idea forward? (actions) The complexity of psychosocial issues means that behavioral science is well suited to develop both hypotheses-driven and phenomenological research to understand bio-psycho-social health issues. Grant writing does not need to be mysterious or daunting. It can provide a means to an end, not only to fund research but also as a means to an end of health disparities.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;D.

Less than one in four had received grants of $250,000 or more. Although less than one in four faculty (23%) felt prepared to write grants immediately following graduation, four of five currently felt prepared to do so. Two barriers to grant writing were identified by a majority of faculty: heavy teaching loads (68%) and administrative or committee assignments (55%).

Developing grant writing skills is a way to attract resources to explore the feasibility and potential efficacy of changes to improve patient outcomes or efficiencies of care. This article describes the purpose of grant writing by advanced practice nurses (APNs), discusses the needs for and benefits of grant writing, identifies types and sources of available grants, describes potential roles of APNs in grant writing, describes ways to overcome barriers to grant writing, and presents strategies for writing winning grants to develop and improve practice in acute and critical care settings. These strategies will help APNs get started and provide a guide to follow in writing their first grant or will refresh their existing grant writing skills.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

Identifying, understanding and linking current evidence to best practice can be challenging and requires at least a basic understanding of research principles and methodologies. However, not all primary health care professionals are trained in research or have research experience. With the aim of enhancing research skills and developing a research culture in primary health care, University Departments of General Practice and Rural Health have been supported since 2000 by the Australian Government funded &#x27;Primary Health Care Research Evaluation and Development (PHCRED) Strategy&#x27;.A small grant funding scheme to support primary health care practitioners was implemented through the PHCRED program at Flinders University in South Australia between 2002 and 2005. The scheme incorporated academic mentors and three types of funding support: bursaries, writing grants and research fellowships. This article describes outcomes of the funding scheme and contributes to the debate surrounding the effectiveness of funding schemes as a means of building research capacity.MethodsFunding recipients who had completed their research were invited to participate in a semi-structured 40-minute telephone interview. Feedback was sought on acquisition of research skills, publication outcomes, development of research capacity, confidence and interest in research, and perception of research. Data were also collected on demographics, research topics, and time needed to complete planned activities.ResultsThe funding scheme supported 24 bursaries, 11 writing grants, and three research fellows. Nearly half (47%) of all grant recipients were allied health professionals, followed by general practitioners (21%). The majority (70%) were novice and early career researchers.Eighty-nine percent of the grant recipients were interviewed. Capacity, confidence, and level of research skills in ten core areas were generally considered to have improved as a result of the award. More than half (53%) had presented their research and 32% had published or submitted an article in a peer-reviewed journal.ConclusionA small grant and mentoring scheme through a University Department can effectively enhance research skills, confidence, output, and interest in research of primary health care practitioners.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;K.

The answer is, not enough, but the ones who do understand that they are selling their ideas and skills to the grant reviewers are the well-funded ones. The ability to market your ideas is the most critical feature of the art of grant writing.Marketing your research plan of course requires that you have a good idea, one that is creative, innovative, exciting and do-able. In clinical medicine or engineering, ideas might also be judged on their potential to lead to a pragmatic application. And, from the grant giver&#x27;s standpoint, a good idea has another important attribute. The grant giver&#x27;s goal is to fund work that furthers their mission. A good idea is one that&#x27;s in line with that mission. It came as a surprise to me several years ago when I realized that the main aim of the National Institutes of Health or the Medical Research Council is to not fund my research. Thus, the most important homework you can do, before writing the first word of a grant application, is to match your priorities with those of one or more grant givers.One of the most important things you can do to ensure that your writing is clear and focused is to get experienced grant writers to review drafts of your proposal. These should include an expert in your field, a good scientific editor (especially important if you&#x27;re writing in a language other than your mother tongue) and an intelligent non-specialist. A grant-savvy scientist in another discipline is best qualified to catch fuzzy writing and jargon. Finally, choose reviewers who have the time and who care enough about you and your career to do a careful review. Your department chairman might have the inclination but does he or she have the time?After 20 years of grant writing, I can still produce wordy, unfocused first draftsUnderstanding what reviewers look for is critical to writing a successful grant application. Try to put yourself in the reviewer&#x27;s shoes. The typical member of a review panel for a government granting agency is a 40-something full professor, faced with his or her own grants, teaching, committees, editorial responsibilities, graduate students, mortgage payments, rebelling teenagers, aging parents, mildewed roses, and so on. These reviewers, always pressed for time and possibly not experts in your field, want to see your main ideas or points at the beginning of the grant application and also near the front of each section.It&#x27;s worth thinking about the way most of us read a scientific paper when you write a grant. Most people read the abstract first, to get an overview of the whole, and the discussion next, to get to the main ideas and conclusions. Reviewers read grant applications with this same attitude. Meet their expectations by providing an abstract or summary that answers the key questions: what are you going to do? why is it worth doing? where will it lead? and (briefly) how are you going to do it?Preparing a grant application differs in several important ways from writing a scientific paper, although we often subconsciously adopt the same style for our grant applications. If you are asked to write a background or rationale section, begin with an overview of the questions or problems you will address and why they are important. The experimental methods section should start with an overview of the experimental design or plan, followed by the details of the methods or techniques. Jumping directly into the methods suggests you care more about techniques than ideas.Choosing the right grant giver, having a good idea that you develop in a clear, focused proposal, and understanding the grant review process enhance your chances but do not guarantee funding. What happens if you don&#x27;t succeed the first time? I find encouragement in the saying \u2018The only people who don&#x27;t make mistakes are the ones who don&#x27;t do anything\u2019. The best scientists occasionally write unfunded proposals, and sometimes dramatically new ideas are harder to get funded than \u2018pretty good\u2019 ones. If your grant fails to get funded the first time, don&#x27;t quit. Revise and resubmit.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

De-implementing ineffective, unproven, harmful, overused, inappropriate, and/or low-value health services and practices is important for mitigating patient harm, improving processes of care, and reducing healthcare costs. A better understanding of the state-of-the-science is needed to guide future objectives and funding initiatives. To this end, we characterized de-implementation research grants funded by the United States (US) National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).MethodsWe used systematic methods to search, identify, and describe de-implementation research grants funded across all 27 NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) and AHRQ from fiscal year 2000 through 2017. Eleven key terms and three funding opportunity announcements were used to search for research grants in the NIH Query, View and Report (QVR) system. Two coders identified eligible grants based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. A codebook was developed, pilot tested, and revised before coding the full grant applications of the final sample.ResultsA total of 1277 grants were identified through the QVR system; 542 remained after removing duplicates. After the multistep eligibility assessment and review process, 20 grant applications were coded. Many grants were funded by NIH (n\u2009=\u200915), with fewer funded by AHRQ, and a majority were funded between fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (n\u2009=\u200911). Grant proposals focused on de-implementing a range of health services and practices (e.g., medications, therapies, screening tests) across various health areas (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease) and delivery settings (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, schools). Grants proposed to use a variety of study designs and research methods (e.g., experimental, observational, mixed methods) to accomplish study aims.ConclusionsBased on the systematic portfolio analysis of NIH- and AHRQ-funded research grants over the past 17\u00a0years, relatively few have focused on studying the de-implementation of ineffective, unproven, harmful, overused, inappropriate, and/or low-value health services and practices provided to patients by healthcare practitioners and systems.

Aims: To assist medical educators with writing educational research grant proposals, we propose a set of 12 tips for writing competitive grant proposals. Methods: We distilled challenges and effective strategies and approaches from our experience in writing and assisting with education research grant proposals. We presented these challenges and approaches at faculty development workshops on writing educational research grant proposals conducted over the past 3 years and evaluated the outcomes of these presentations and the participant&#x27;s experiences with educational research grant writing. Results: Approximately 100 participating faculty provided feedback, affirming that these sessions were very useful for developing grant proposals and for reaching out to funding agencies and that these faculty development efforts in grant writing are much needed. Conclusions: Based on our experiences with education grants and workshop efforts, we propose a set of strategies for faculty to seek grant sources and write promising education research grant proposals.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

Increasingly, funding opportunities for translational biomedical research require studies to engage community partners, patients, or other stakeholders in the research process to address their concerns. However, there is little evidence on strategies to prepare teams of academic and community partners to collaborate on grants. This paper presents the description and formative evaluation of a two\u2010part community\u2013academic partnered grant writing series designed to help community organizations and academic institutions build infrastructure for collaborative research projects using a partnered approach. The first phase of the series was a half\u2010day workshop on grant readiness, which was open to all interested community partners. The second phase, open only to community\u2013academic teams that met eligibility criteria, was a 12\u2010week session that covered partnered grant writing for foundation grants and National Institutes of Health grants. Participants in both phases reported an increase in knowledge and self\u2010efficacy for writing partnered proposals. At 1\u2010year follow\u2010up, participants in Phase 2 had secured approximately $1.87 million in funding. This community\u2013academic partnered grant writing series helped participants obtain proposal development skills and helped community\u2013academic teams successfully compete for funding.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Keyonna M.

One needs to target one&#x27;s grant application to a specific agency or foundation. The formats that one will use to write grants for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the US Department of Defense, or the National Institutes for Standards and Technology (NIST) are completely different. The grant application is only as good as the people involved. One needs to provide documentation that one, one&#x27;s colleagues, and one&#x27;s collaborators have the expertise, training, and record of productivity required to successfully complete the project. Granting agencies such as the NIH favor grants that include extensive preliminary data sections. Other agencies, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration (DARPA), are more receptive to projects at early stages of development. Research studies proposing to use animal subjects must be reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) composed of a veterinarian, scientist, ethicist, and a community representative.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

With funding-success rates declining steadily [1], ensuring sufficient resources to sustain a research program has become an uncertain proposition for many scientists and clinicianinvestigators. Grants get funded (or not) for many reasons, but I think most grants go to research teams that funding agencies believe contain a high degree of expertise and ability. Therefore, when writing a research grant, it is critical to define who will be on the team. All research grants are submitted by a Principal Investigator (PI), but there may be many co-PIs and collaborators involved. These team members can be fellow researchers, methodologists, clinical experts, statisticians, and sometimes even patient representatives. The more-developed the research team, the better the odds of success. Put in this context, it is critical for PIs not to write their grants alone. Grants written by one person read like they were written by one person, and not by the team they represent. One person (often the PI) can formulate a research idea, but the plan should derive from discussions with colleagues and collaborators. Indeed, a research grant proposal should include the voices of all of the team members. That said, it can be challenging not only to make sure that all the appropriate voices are heard, but that the final grant maintains a cohesive and flowing narrative. To achieve this balance, I suggest starting with an outline, and inviting the whole team to comment on it early in the grant-writing process. At this stage, team members can also decide which section of the grant most suits their expertise. For example, the statistician can write the sample-size calculation and statistical plan, while the team\u2019s methodologists can focus on the sections falling within his or her purview. For clinical research, not surprisingly, the clinician-scientists (often including the PI) typically tackle the background and rationale sections of the grant. The approach to this stage seems logical to the point of being obvious. However, there are hidden challenges related to individual schedules, expectations, and habits that can impede the progress of the initial grant-writing steps. One way to handle these potential challenges is to arrange for a half-day or full-day meeting of all investigators in which the overall theme of the grant and the individual team member assignments are clearly laid out, including the specific timelines to be met.

A s an oncology advanced practitioner, you may find yourself called upon to write or partner with a nurse scientist to write a grant to support or improve educational, patient care, or professional activities. There are different types of grants that can be used to support a variety of activities, such as research grants, educational program development grants, and quality improvement/clinical practice grants, to name a few. Writing your grant application requires quite a bit of preparation. Before you begin, it is important to review the grant application and its specific instructions\u2014they can vary widely in their parameters. Adherence to the grant instructions is a critical aspect of grant preparation. Grant proposals that do not adhere to page length, font type, and other specifications may not even be reviewed. Pay careful attention to the grant personnel who will carry out the proposal. Some grant mechanisms require a doctoral degree as the minimum preparation for the primary investigator or for educational grants, the program director. You must consider what additional expertise may be required to carry out the project or research successfully. You may need a nurse cli-nician or other provider to grant access to a patient population, a statistician, or another specialty (physical therapy , laboratory services, educator) that would provide expertise and services to complete the project or research. Data analysis for the research or project outcomes should be considered at the very start of the proposal. Secure the advice of a statistician in determining the study sample size, measures to be used, and the plan for data analysis. As protection of human subjects and informed consent are of paramount importance, even in simple survey or educational research methods, a thorough understanding of Internal Review Board (IRB) requirements and submission for IRB approval requires planning; it can take several months to gain approval. Lastly, consideration of budget costs and constraints is necessary to be sure to be able to cover the costs of completing the proposed project or research. Clarity and attention to detail are aspects of grant writing that make for a successful application. Be clear, concise, and precise. Define what you&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

However, opportunities for junior faculty to learn these skills are highly variable. Thus, we developed a grant writing program to assist in the preparation of an NIH R proposal. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The R Club Grant Program was implemented in 2021 for junior faculty of the University of Cincinnati\u2019s College of Medicine and Center for Clinical &amp; Translational Science &amp; Training (CCTST). The program consists of a series of workshops (e.g., How to Craft a Specific Aims Page, How to Construct a Competitive R01 Proposal) utilizing examples of successful proposals and grant review criteria to demonstrate how to translate a conceptual framework into a research proposal (level 1). All participants can receive constructive feedback on a Specific Aims page from an experienced grant writer (level 2), and for a select cohort, the program provides comprehensive scientific content edits and iterative feedback on a full research proposal, with a focus on grantsmanship, presentation, and overall competitiveness (level 3). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Over three NIH grant cycles, the program to date has provided 38 early-career investigators with multi-level grant writing support. All participants attended the workshops and received supporting documents, 21 received feedback on a Specific Aims page, and 6 received one-on-one writing assistance on their full research proposal. Of the 6 investigators who received the greatest level of support, 3 have received NIH scientific review, with a 66.6% funding success rate for either an original (R01, n=1) or subsequent overlapping (R35, n=1) proposal. In a survey sent to workshop attendees, 100% of respondents (n=23) reported ( Strongly Agreed or Agreed ) that the training was a worthwhile investment in their professional development and 96% stated that they will be able to apply the knowledge and skills learned. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Initial evaluation measures suggest that grant writing support programs have great potential to enhance funding success rates. As the program evolves it will be crucial to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative feedback measures to ensure efforts are directed to the appropriate level(s) of service to maximize the funding success of our faculty.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jennifer Veevers&quot;,&quot;Patrick H.

In the future, more and more grant funded programs will be a necessary part of our work in student affairs. This manuscript offers basic tools for understanding best practices of grant writing and the principles that should guide student affairs personnel in grant writing endeavors. Financial constraints throughout academe create heightened attention on external sources of funds. While typically associated with faculty and research, grant writing represents a substantive way in which student affairs personnel can demonstrate their abilities as educators. In terms of professional development, student affairs staff members can benefit from collaboration in writing grants, managing the grants, and in conducting research associated with the project. Their insights to the cocurricular lives of students are a salient perspective that other segments of a campus can benefit from as the dialogue unfolds regarding a grant proposal. The nature of requests for proposals (RFPs) has changed in ways that encourage student affairs to participate actively. For example, many agencies now approach programmatic project ideas from a collaborative viewpoint of the campus, as opposed to non-collaborative, isolated projects. In addition, the evaluation and research components now required in many RFPs necessitate a perspective on the students&#x27; holistic experiences, rather than data such as grade point average or retention rates. The agencies are equally concerned with questions of \\&quot;how\\&quot; and \\&quot;why,\\&quot; as they are with questions of \\&quot;what\\&quot; and \\&quot;how much.\\&quot; Even if student affairs professionals do not take the lead on a grant project, their collaboration with other campus components will become more vital to ensure that co-curricular concerns are addressed. Currently, a dearth of literature exists regarding the involvement of student affairs professionals involved in grant writing endeavors. Guiding Principles Begin with an Idea To receive funding, a proposal must demonstrate fit between the institutional strategic plan, the goals of the sponsor, and the objectives of the project. The strongest proposals demonstrate a rigorous alignment with guidelines of the sponsor. Even an idea with a great deal of merit and research will not be funded if the program goals do not align with those of the sponsor. A writing team should critically examine sponsors that possibly align with a project idea and institution. Many sponsors will post past awardees, including institution, name of project, and contact information. Identify Sponsors Funding sources for grants include federal (e.g., U.S. Department of Education at www.ed.gov) and state agencies (e.g., State Department of Human Services), private foundations (e.g., John and Catherine T. McArthur Foundation at www.macfdn.org, Coca-Cola\u00ae at www2.coca-cola.com/foundation), and professional organizations (e.g., SACSA at www.sacsa.org). Campuses may also be members of national search agencies that will research sponsors for a particular idea or niche. When the proposal is ready to be submitted, the team may choose to submit it to one agency or to more than one. If the proposal is accepted by more than one agency, the campus must choose one and decline the other. Write with a Team Once a project has been generally defined and possible sponsors have been identified, a writing team should be established that is representative of the project stakeholders. The team leader may be pre-determined or designated by the group. For an effective writing team, the project requires personnel familiar with the institutions or departments involved and who also have authority to commit resources on behalf of their units. Once the team is assembled, the members must read through the RFP carefully to identify the requisite components of the proposal. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Bonnie V.

As the leading section of the proposal, the specific-aims section serves as a 1-page synopsis that needs to gain the attention and interest of the reviewers. It must present a compelling case for the importance of the proposed work and provide a convincing rationale and evidence that you and your team are the best people to carry out the project. Developing the specific-aims page is usually the first stage of the grant writing process, as it provides an overview of the proposal and research directions. Furthermore, it can be instrumental in getting external feedback from program officers, collaborators, and others as the grant develops. The process of writing the Specific Aims page requires that one touch on each of the elements that comprise the scoring criteria of the proposal (eg, significance, innovation, investigator(s), approach, and environment) and succinctly introduce all the main topics that will be addressed in the application, but focus especially on the knowledge gap and the importance of filling it, the central hypothesis and the aims that will address it, and the overall impact of the work. This page sets a clear framework for writing the rest of the grant. In this article, we present a set of recommendations and guidelines on how to utilize an algorithmic approach to develop the specific-aims page, what elements to include, and how to maximize its value to create a competitive grant.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

For the new faculty member applying the first time for outside research funding, it is important to seek help from experienced and more senior colleagues, especially those who are actively serving on NIH Study Sections. It is a good idea to remember that the individuals reviewing applications are some of our busiest scientists. The job of grant review is clearly an added assignment that they willingly donate their time to and one needs to consider this when writing a grant application. Anything that can be done to make the reviewer&#x27;s job easier can only help the application. Brevity, clarity, and organization are essential to a good application. As has been repeatedly mentioned, one of the major application weaknesses sited is a lack of focus, especially in the presentation of the Research Plans. For the new applicant, it is very helpful to plan enough time for completion of the application so that it could be reviewed by others thoroughly knowledgeable in this particular area. Once the application is submitted, the applicant should take advantage of opportunities to interact with the Executive Secretary of the Study Section to which the grant is assigned. Every institution&#x27;s research office maintains a book identifying all of the Study Sections, the current members of the Study Section, and the Chairman. The assignment of the grant application to a particular study is an administrative one occurring at NIH upon receipt of the grant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Start by surrounding yourself with a successful mentor and accompanying team with a good track record. Get organized, select clear goals and objectives to your project. Once the foundation for the grant is set, begin by generating a robust hypothesis. Once your hypothesis is clearly defined, you should contact the project officer of the specific grant for which you are applying; they can help identify if the proposal meets an area of need. The basic components of a grant include the following: the face page, which highlights the key contributors; followed by table of contents; abstract; biographical sketches, which are minicurriculum vitae; budget; research plan, which is composed mostly of background, significance, and specific aims; and lastly, references cited. Be sure to follow specific formatting. Use resources including the internet to find an appropriate grant. Finally, given the confines of a busy surgical practice and the significant amount of work necessary to complete a grant, it is essential that the work begins early and well in advance of the proposed deadline.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jason T.

It is based on sound planning, development, implementation and evaluation strategies. An important component of the grant/proposal writing process is to address not only the needs of the organization, but also the needs of the funding source. The opportunity to capture your intended funder&#x27;s attention is limited, usually to the first few sentences. Make the most of the opportunity by concentrating on the opening sentences of the proposal. Make no mistake -fewer words make a great impact.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

The answer is, not enough, but the ones who do understand that they are selling their ideas and skills to the grant reviewers are the well-funded ones. The ability to market your ideas is the most critical feature of the art of grant writing.Marketing your research plan of course requires that you have a good idea, one that is creative, innovative, exciting and do-able. In clinical medicine or engineering, ideas might also be judged on their potential to lead to a pragmatic application. And, from the grant giver&#x27;s standpoint, a good idea has another important attribute. The grant giver&#x27;s goal is to fund work that furthers their mission. A good idea is one that&#x27;s in line with that mission. It came as a surprise to me several years ago when I realized that the main aim of the National Institutes of Health or the Medical Research Council is to not fund my research. Thus, the most important homework you can do, before writing the first word of a grant application, is to match your priorities with those of one or more grant givers.One of the most important things you can do to ensure that your writing is clear and focused is to get experienced grant writers to review drafts of your proposal. These should include an expert in your field, a good scientific editor (especially important if you&#x27;re writing in a language other than your mother tongue) and an intelligent non-specialist. A grant-savvy scientist in another discipline is best qualified to catch fuzzy writing and jargon. Finally, choose reviewers who have the time and who care enough about you and your career to do a careful review. Your department chairman might have the inclination but does he or she have the time?After 20 years of grant writing, I can still produce wordy, unfocused first draftsUnderstanding what reviewers look for is critical to writing a successful grant application. Try to put yourself in the reviewer&#x27;s shoes. The typical member of a review panel for a government granting agency is a 40-something full professor, faced with his or her own grants, teaching, committees, editorial responsibilities, graduate students, mortgage payments, rebelling teenagers, aging parents, mildewed roses, and so on. These reviewers, always pressed for time and possibly not experts in your field, want to see your main ideas or points at the beginning of the grant application and also near the front of each section.It&#x27;s worth thinking about the way most of us read a scientific paper when you write a grant. Most people read the abstract first, to get an overview of the whole, and the discussion next, to get to the main ideas and conclusions. Reviewers read grant applications with this same attitude. Meet their expectations by providing an abstract or summary that answers the key questions: what are you going to do? why is it worth doing? where will it lead? and (briefly) how are you going to do it?Preparing a grant application differs in several important ways from writing a scientific paper, although we often subconsciously adopt the same style for our grant applications. If you are asked to write a background or rationale section, begin with an overview of the questions or problems you will address and why they are important. The experimental methods section should start with an overview of the experimental design or plan, followed by the details of the methods or techniques. Jumping directly into the methods suggests you care more about techniques than ideas.Choosing the right grant giver, having a good idea that you develop in a clear, focused proposal, and understanding the grant review process enhance your chances but do not guarantee funding. What happens if you don&#x27;t succeed the first time? I find encouragement in the saying \u2018The only people who don&#x27;t make mistakes are the ones who don&#x27;t do anything\u2019. The best scientists occasionally write unfunded proposals, and sometimes dramatically new ideas are harder to get funded than \u2018pretty good\u2019 ones. If your grant fails to get funded the first time, don&#x27;t quit. Revise and resubmit.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Coley &amp; Cynthia A. Scheinberg&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Coley and Scheinberg\u2019s Proposal Writing: Effective Grantsmanship is a strong example of the kind of resource I recommend all MSWs have on their bookshelf: a clear and concise primer on the process of writing a strong grant proposal. The book clearly describes the nuts and bolts of proposal writing, highlights major pitfalls often encountered, and offers sound advice on ways to increase the probability of funding success. The book begins by offering an overview of the major types of funding proposals (government/foundation/corporate) and outlines the major components of a proposal, all along the way offering the reader useful suggestions. In the case of a co-written proposal, for example, the authors recommend assigning a point person responsible for pulling pieces together in time to meet submission deadlines. In the case of a nascent organization, they suggest exploring the possibility of a partnership with a more established agency that might bring more credibility to the initiative. Chapter two offers a brief (and not terribly informative) discussion of the usefulness of technology in finding and evaluating potential funders and sources of data on both the intervention and community. Future editions of the book might highlight AmericanFactFinder, which makes accessing community-level census and American Community Survey data relatively easy. The authors then turn to a discussion of the importance of understanding the agency (to identify strengths and weaknesses), the funder (to identify priorities), and the community (to identify goodness-of-fit). These elements are important not simply for the purposes of writing a strong proposal, but also more critically for effective program development that meets the needs of the community in an accessible manner. Before seeking funding, the authors challenge readers to ask, \u201cIs the service the right one for the client?\u201d (p. 29). After laying the groundwork, the book discusses the major components of the proposal: the needs statement, the goals and objectives, the project narrative, the evaluation plan, the budget, and \u201cfinishing touches\u201d such as the cover letter.

However, few articles have evaluated the impact of grant writing workshops on NIH grant submission and award rates. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The K Writing program was developed by the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) at the University of Michigan. Since 2012, 435 scholars have participated in the program. The MICHR K Writing program is a three-part workshop series that prepares scholars by providing them with guidelines to write all sections of a career development grant application. Each session focuses on different sections of the K award proposal. During the workshop sessions, participants break into small groups and exchange drafts of their proposal sections and receive peer critique and feedback from senior faculty facilitators who have experience with NIH study sections. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Between 2012-2018, 273 scholars participated and 57% were female. Our two primary outcomes of interest are submission rates and success rates (the number of grants awarded divided by the number of applications). We plan to examine the effects of several characteristics, including number of sessions attended, cohort year, and faculty vs. postdoctoral status. We will also examine whether there were differences in submission and success rates between female and male researchers and between underrepresented minority scholars and those who identified as white or Asian. Lastly, we will report submission and success rates for each grant mechanism and compare them to the national averages. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Obtaining external research funding is an important part of a faculty career, especially at its early stages. This research has important implications for the design of similar programs intended to increase submission and success rates for federal grant applications.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Phillip A.

Educators must raise their own funds to meet their needs for research and teaching, so they are compelled to write proposals for grants. Grants and other funding are increasingly becoming difficult to obtain. To be competitive for funding, an educator must submit a strong proposal that creates a good first impression to the reviewer. A proposal that is well written, clear, and easy for the reviewer to read and understand generally has a better chance of being funded than one that is poorly written. Since many engineering educators have little background in writing, this paper gives guidelines for creating a strong proposal to prospective authors. General appearance of the proposal, including graphs, figures, and charts, is an important part of writing a successful grant. Common errors in writing are included, and basic rules for most frequently misused grammar are given with a discussion of words, sentence structure, and paragraph organization. General references that can be used in preparation of proposals are included. The various sections of a proposal, such as the budget, are reviewed with information on types of material to include in each. Additionally, general advice for fust time authors is included. Following these basic guidelines will aid in the writing of a s~cc=ssful grant proposal. What Is A Grant? A grant is an award of money for an idea or project. education, etc. Grants may cover all costs associated with a defray administrative costs at the university (indirect costs). Grants are given for research, training, service, project (direct costs) or may include money to help Granting agencies include the government, which is the m-ost abundant source of funds; privat; foundations, which are g;ne;ally for specific int;rests; and business and industry, which often require contracts and carefully monitor the research or project to see that the business\u2019 goals are being met. A successful grant writer is one who has a good projector research idea, has goals that are consistent with the granting agency, has carefully thought through the project plan, and has a strong, well-written proposal. Even though the project or research idea maybe outstanding, the granting agency must have the same goals before a grant will be awarded. Before spending time and effort writing and submitting a proposal, the writer should check to be sure the granting agency or business is interested in the research idea or project and for any written instructions along with deadlines for submission of the proposal.1 Sources of Sup~or[ A search for money must start with an idea for research or for the use of the requested money. A knowledge of the sources of money for education and research is basic to obtaining funding to meet the educator\u2019s needs. Many universities have an Office for Sponsored Research or an Office of Grants and ?$iiiw) 1996 ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings \u2018.@lHH_..\u2019 . P ge 131.1 Contracts. The research office may publish a monthly bulletin of available grants, maintain a list of granting agencies, and/or list grants given by the university. Another excellent resource is the university library where one can find various information services which provide details about grants or contracts from the federal, state, and local governments, business and industry, intrauniversity funds, and other sources. Also, the Internet and computer services such as e-mail provide information on available grants from many sources. To help prospective grant writers write a successful proposal, numerous workshops and guides are available and can be located either in the library or through computer sources.2 Writimz A Successful Prot)osal A successful grant proposal is one that receives funding regardless of the importance of the projector research. Although most submitted proposals present good, solid ideas, all can not be funded. Proposals based on weak ideas for research or projects generally are not funded. Although a poorly written proposal maybe funded if the idea is truly outstanding and the investigator has excellent credentials, most proposals that are poorly written are rarely funded. The successful proposals are those that can be sold to the granting agency. A proposal that is well written and easy for the reviewer to read and understand is more likely to receive funding. The review process generally consists of assigning the proposal to primary reviewers and secondary reviewers. The primary reviewers will look at the proposal and give it a full review in most cases; however, secondary reviewers often glance through the proposals and look only for major details. Two sections of a proposal all reviewers concentrate on are the budget justification and the biographical sketches that give information about the prospective researchers. Therefore, the budget and the biographical sketches must show what the writer wants all the reviewers to see in a glance. All sections of the grant should be easy to read, and major points should be prominent for the reviewers.3 The appearance of the proposal is of utmost importance since the first impression the proposal has for the reviewer is crucial to the full review. General rules for the appearance of a successful proposal follow.1\u20193$4\u20195 000 Use a word processor or desk top publisher to prepare the proposal. 000 Each page should have the same appearance, i.e. same fonts, printer. cwo Each page should be an original, not a photocopy of an older document. mm Charts and graphs with proper titles add to the quality of the proposal. 000 Indent and use headings and double spacing between sections when possible to make the proposal easier to read. OOO Do not fill every possible space with words; use recommended font size (12 if one is not specified). cwo Follow all guidelines for format of the proposal. Do not deviate from page restrictions, section order, and other requirements. 000 Use titles and diagrams to increase the ease of review. 000 Double space between paragraphs. mm Make sure there are no TYPOS or other inconsistencies in the paper. Good writing is concise and to the point; present only essential material. Parts of A l?ro~osal Although each funding agency will have specific requirements for grants, most proposals will include the following sections: abstract; problem statement, rationale, and specific aims; background and significance procedure, research plan, or experimental design and methods; budget and budget justification; literature cited, and biographical sketches of key personnel. If there are consultants or other contractual arrangements, letters from each indicating the willingness to participate should be included.1\u20193 ~hx~~ 1996 ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings \u2018?+,~yy: P ge 131.2 Abstract The abstract may be the only section of a proposal that some reviewers read. The abstract needs to be concise and attract the attention of the reviewers. A brief overview of the proposed project with a summary of the specific aims of the project should be included. Do not make the abstract a table of contents by listing the sections of the grant. Problem Statementor Rationale The problem statement is as important as the abstract and should contain the idea that is to be developed. The objectives or goals for the project should be clear.

Backizround and Simificance The background section contains reference to prior work in the area of the proposed project. The section should contain relevant information to illustrate why the project is important, that it is feasible, and how the investigator is capable of completing the project. A diagram to summarize related work and show how the proposed work can be completed will help the reviewer understand the significance of the project. Procedure This section of the proposal includes a logical, organized, and detailed explanation of the procedures that will b used to accomplish the objectives of the project. The procedure section may include a technical plan and a management plan. A technical plan includes highly specific details of the methods, tests, instrumentation, quality control, materials, design approach, and special techniques. A management plan includes a description of key personnel with their qualifications to accomplish the goals of the proposal. Also, include organization support or collaborative effort; resources, such as equipment, space, laboratories; and schedule for completion of the proposal in the procedure section. Tables or diagrams used to simplify the explanation are welcomed by reviewers. Figures and Tables Whenever possible, include figures or tables to communicate complicated ideas and help the reviewer through the proposal. Use attractive figures and tables that are clear and easy to understand without reading long explanations. Numerical data presented in tables or figures are generally faster to scan and easier to visualize than when presented in text form. Tables can be used to present much information in a relatively small amount of space. Figur&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;John H.

Although most schools receive funding from a variety of sources, the monies are not always available to fund special projects and programs. Most school personnel are not aware of all the ways to allocate resources and develop long-range plans to meet a school&#x27;s assessed needs. Developing a proposal-writing team at your school is a good technique for bringing school plans and personnel together, for learning to maximize local resources and for finding additional funding for supporting long-range programs. * The Art of Grant Writing Grant writing is a cross between technical writing and creative writing. Money is given to fund educational programs by funding sources with a pre-determined philosophical idea of the programs and projects they are willing to back. Funders also determine the procedures they want you to follow before awarding money. Therefore, if you intend to be funded, you need to make sure your school&#x27;s problems can be solved by the funding source you are soliciting and that you support your program with strong quantitative and qualitative data. When a school finds a funder that meets its program&#x27;s needs, the proposals should tell a story about the problems at the school, offer ideas on how to solve these problems, provide plans on how this will happen, and describe the necessary costs and personnel to make this project come true. * Where Does Money Come From? My father taught me that \\&quot;money does not grow on trees,\\&quot; but then again he did not live long enough to see money fall from machines on walls. For successful grant writers, however, money does grow on trees. It&#x27;s easier to get money when you have money, which is, of course, the \\&quot;American Way\\&quot; of doing business. Grant monies come from a wide variety of resources that include federal funds, state funds, private donations, foundations, local businesses, fund-raising activities and your own school graduates. At the end of this article, I have listed a variety of places to look for major resources, but remember that any resource, no matter how small, can help fund your program. It is often easier to collect $100 from 100 people than $10,000 from one source. The 100 people will only require a thank-you letter, while the major source may require extensive paperwork. Most companies have to give some money away as part of their tax structure. Your job is convincing them to give the money to you. Businesses are always eager to provide funding support that will makes them look better in the eyes of their community. Help them by writing a proposal in which you can all take pride. * The Task of Grant Writing Grant writing is not difficult, but it is hard work and very time consuming. Any educated person can write a successful grant, or you can find a grant writer to coach you through the process. The final grant, however, should express the needs of the students and the passion of the school to change education in terms of student needs. First of all, there are no generic grants. Grantors will all ask their questions a little bit differently and no two final grants will look alike. That does not mean you cannot use information from one grant to support another. In fact, schools that receive multi-grants usually stick to one set of solutions and continue to request funding from different sources for the same basic program. Federal and state grants will require a multi-paged proposal plus district and local documentation pages. Foundation and corporate funding sources prefer shorter proposals, usually a cover letter and a two-page proposal plus tax and budgetary information. Solicitation to local businesses may only require a letter of introduction and intent. However, no matter which type of funding source you seek, the information that you will provide is fairly consistent. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;E.

Next, schedule brainstorming sessions with everyone who\u2019ll be involved in the process. At these sessions, participants can identify statements of need and develop a clear, concise description of the proposed project. Also determine goals, timetables, and how to eval uate the effectiveness of the project during these initial planning sessions. Include industry partners from the community in the grant-planning process because letters of commitment can easily be obtained from those initially involved. The purpose of a letter of commitment is to express the institution\u2019s support of the project. This letter should convince reviewers of the grant application (the grantor) that the project will be successful. Include the project title, a brief summary of the project, and all partners and collaborators in the letter. Show your enthusiasm here! Explore sources of grant funding early. Resources include the federal government, state and local agencies, and professional organizations. A request for proposal (RFP), the primary source of information about each grant, provides an outline of criteria for development of the grant proposal. Consult it early and often to meet the requirements of the granting agency for the proposal. Generally, each grant proposal includes the following sections: cover letter and summary, statement of need, project objectives, project methods and design, evaluation, budget narrative, and proposal appendix.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

While collaborative partnerships have long been encouraged, mandatory collaboration, in which the type of partner organizations (e.g., workforce development boards, K-12 schools, non-profits, community or faith-based groups, industry or businesses, etc.) are designated by the sponsoring agency, has not traditionally been required. However, many Federal departments recognize that in order to achieve the greatest return on the public investment that grants represent, a comprehensive solution that taps into the variety of resources available within a given community must be encouraged (Baker, Homan, Schonhoff &amp; Kreuter, 1999). This commitment to protect taxpayer interests is set forth as part of a Federal agency&#x27;s strategic plan, and reflects its priorities through integration of these interests with its mission and program authorities. Mandatory grant collaboration means that collaborative writing has become a necessary skill for those charged with drafting the proposal document. The opportunity for collaboration presents many advantages for writers such as maximum input, checks and balances, access to a depth of experience, resources, joint knowledge, error reduction/achieving a more accurate text, and potentially, a higher quality document (Appel, 2005; Noel &amp; Robert, 2004). However, these benefits hinge upon the ability of the collaborative group as a whole to carry out interactions and subsequent writing tasks effectively. This is often simpler in theory than in practice, given that the turnaround time for many requests for grant proposals is now 30 to 45 days from announcement in the Federal Register. When such collaborative structures are not already in place (i.e., \\&quot;... an alliance among individuals linked by a common problem in order to develop a viable solution for addressing that problem\\&quot;) (Crawley, Hughes, Dopke &amp; Dolan, 2007, p. 184), creating an innovative program that represents a true collaboration of organizational resources and ongoing reciprocity can be difficult to achieve within these constraints. Moreover, even when underlying structures for collaboration are in place, the communication required to orchestrate a diverse team through a successful grant writing endeavor, and subsequent implementation (if funding is awarded), tends to be challenging from the outset for a number of reasons. For instance, group members from representative organizations may play diverse roles and/ or have differing levels of influence within and outside of their organization (Bacon, 1990), leading to dissention in assignment of tasks. Partnering organizations also do not necessarily share similar missions and organizational acculturation (Palmeri, 2004), which dictate how and when work is accomplished. The group&#x27;s ability to mediate these, and other differences, therefore likely plays a significant role in whether or not they can achieve a successful outcome. In addition, \\&quot;because collaborative work often places unique demands on participants --requiring some unfamiliar attitudes and behaviors and a wide range of specialized skills--collaborative capacity is greatly influenced by both the existing skills, knowledge and attitudes members bring to the table and efforts taken to build, support, and access this capacity\\&quot; (Foster-Fishman, Berkowitz &amp; Lounsbury, 2001, p. 243). In other words, not only is it essential to strategically select the group&#x27;s members, as each individual&#x27;s skills, talents and work habits must provide an added value to the whole, but the ability of the group to communicate and work together to achieve its collective purpose also largely depends on how effectively its dynamics are organized and managed to create conditions that promote collaboration. Ensuring the success of collaborative grant writing endeavors is of utmost importance for organizations seeking Federal grant funding. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;L.

They assert that clear, understandable language which quickly helps the reader understand the proposal is critical to a successful review, and they offer suggestions for structuring and writing the proposal to enhance comprehension. They recommend conventions for clearly presenting key components such as timelines, work scope, and evaluation plans, and they also offer ideas for designing an evaluation plan that is responsive to project components, has a high potential for effectiveness, and will be simple to operationalize. The budget planning process is analyzed, with examples for developing budget components, displaying and communicating them effectively, and outlining strategies for generating future funding.

However many (clinician-) scientists receive little, or no, training in the process of writing a successful grant application. In an era of reductions in research budgets and application success rates, the ability to construct a well presented, clear, articulate proposal is becoming more important than ever. Obtaining grants is a method to achieve your long term research goals. If you are able to formulate these long term goals, it is relevant to explore the market and investigate all potential grant opportunities.

Much postgraduate training focuses on the later elements and gives short shrift to the earlier ones. This article attempts to fill that gap by discussing a pivotal element of the funding process: preparing effective grant applications. In addition to discussing the fundamental features of the pivotal sections of a standard National Institutes of Health (NIH) R-series application (see \u201cTypes of Grant Programs\u201d on the Web site of the NIH Office of Extramural Research for a complete list of NIH-sponsored grant programs1), the sections below outline measures preliminary to the actual grant writing process, rhetorical perspectives and tactics useful to grant writers, the NIH grant application review and scoring process, and the importance of revision and resubmission.\\n\\nGrant applications (hereafter I often use the common shorthand \u201cgrant\u201d to mean \u201cgrant application\u201d) are, of course, judged not only on the text, tables, and figures reviewed by the funding agency but also on everything that stands behind the document: the ideas, the researchers and their collective experience, and the researchers\u2019 host institutions. A successful grant must persuade reviewers that all of these bases have been covered and that the probability of delivering fruitful findings is high. Thus, a necessary preliminary step in planning any research project is to secure the enthusiastic support of department heads, deans, and managers. Demonstrating that the proposed research has institutional support (in the form of researcher time, support staff, physical space, access to necessary equipment, etc) reassures reviewers that the research will be nurtured in a propitious environment. Second, assembling the best team possible to prepare the grant and to accomplish the work is imperative. This \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;D.

In these days of budget shortfalls, universities are asking their faculty to take on additional teaching loads, often at the expense of time that could be dedicated to grant writing, just when the financial gains to the university from external grants would be most valuable. This provides an interesting challenge to sponsored program officers: how to encourage writing grant proposals and develop grantsmanship in faculty, especially new faculty, during these tough financial times. The Sponsored Project and Research Center (SPARC) Office at the University of Northern Colorado has developed an innovative program designed to encourage and support grant writing activities in young faculty. The Sponsored Project Development Award (SPDA) Fellowship Program is a two-year fellowship designed for new faculty. Faculty members submit applications to the SPARC Office, which then reviews the applications and selects a group of SPDA Fellows to begin the fellowship together as a cohort. The Fellowship makes certain demands on the fellows during the two-year program, but it also provides the fellows with a variety of incentives to aid in their grant writing development. The Application Form Cover Page, which describes the requirements and benefits of the program, is included as Appendix A. Note that both the department chair and the dean must sign off on the application, thereby guaranteeing both their financial and logistical support for the fellow while he/she participates in the program. In Spring 2003, the SPARC Office chose a cohort of seven faculty to participate in the SPDA Program. This paper contains a description of how the SPARC Office developed the SPDA Program and garnered support for the program from the university administration. It also contains direct feedback on aspects of the SPDA Program from the seven current fellows including information on the diversity of backgrounds represented by the fellows, perceptions of the pros and cons of the program, and suggestions for improvement. Conception and Support for the SPDA Program The SPARC Office at the University of Northern Colorado developed the Sponsored Project Development Award Fellowship Program as one piece of its internal grants program. Begun in the fall of 2001, the goal was to increase the number of faculty members who were writing successful grant proposals. The design for the Fellowship Program was an amalgamation of ideas garnered from a study of other institutions&#x27; faculty development and internal grants programs and from professional presenters at grant-writing workshops. The method was to bring in ten young faculty members with a desire to become involved in grant proposal writing, to provide them with a research development account, and to involve them, as a cohort, in a year-long series of intensive and hands-on development activities related to grantsmanship and proposal writing. The goal was that when these individuals became successful at getting grants, they would then go on to mentor others. Funding for the program came from the portion of indirect cost recovery retained by SPARC for faculty development. In addition, each of the six deans was asked to contribute $500 from their college toward a research development account for each Fellow. The budget for the program was $40,000, or $4,000 per Fellow, to cover the costs of proposal writing workshops, travel to Washington, visits to mentors, research development accounts of $2,000 per fellow (in addition to the $500 from the deans), and a variety of other development meetings and activities. To encourage buy-in of the program at the college level, each dean was asked to nominate the Fellows from his or her college. The result was an original cohort composed of eleven faculty members (an increase of one from the originally planned ten) from five colleges and the libraries, and from eleven different disciplines. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Marilyn R.

With funding-success rates declining steadily [1], ensuring sufficient resources to sustain a research program has become an uncertain proposition for many scientists and clinicianinvestigators. Grants get funded (or not) for many reasons, but I think most grants go to research teams that funding agencies believe contain a high degree of expertise and ability. Therefore, when writing a research grant, it is critical to define who will be on the team. All research grants are submitted by a Principal Investigator (PI), but there may be many co-PIs and collaborators involved. These team members can be fellow researchers, methodologists, clinical experts, statisticians, and sometimes even patient representatives. The more-developed the research team, the better the odds of success. Put in this context, it is critical for PIs not to write their grants alone. Grants written by one person read like they were written by one person, and not by the team they represent. One person (often the PI) can formulate a research idea, but the plan should derive from discussions with colleagues and collaborators. Indeed, a research grant proposal should include the voices of all of the team members. That said, it can be challenging not only to make sure that all the appropriate voices are heard, but that the final grant maintains a cohesive and flowing narrative. To achieve this balance, I suggest starting with an outline, and inviting the whole team to comment on it early in the grant-writing process. At this stage, team members can also decide which section of the grant most suits their expertise. For example, the statistician can write the sample-size calculation and statistical plan, while the team\u2019s methodologists can focus on the sections falling within his or her purview. For clinical research, not surprisingly, the clinician-scientists (often including the PI) typically tackle the background and rationale sections of the grant. The approach to this stage seems logical to the point of being obvious. However, there are hidden challenges related to individual schedules, expectations, and habits that can impede the progress of the initial grant-writing steps. One way to handle these potential challenges is to arrange for a half-day or full-day meeting of all investigators in which the overall theme of the grant and the individual team member assignments are clearly laid out, including the specific timelines to be met. An inperson meeting allows the investigators to become familiar with one A note from the Editor-in-Chief: We are pleased to present the next installment of \u2018\u2018Pearls\u2019\u2019, a column in Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.  Objectives\nshould be achieved within a limited time and be\nidentified with an actual result.  It is\nrecommended that teen court objectives be\nresult-oriented rather than activity-oriented\n(Crowe and Schaefer, 1992; Fulton, Stone, and\nGendreau, 1994).  Some sample goals and\nobjectives may be found in Figure 4-5.\n\nFigure 4-5: Sample Teen Court Program Goals and Objectives\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of youth to become responsible and productive citizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education and hands-on experience in the judicial system.\n\nobjective 1: 90% of youth attending the five-week teen court training seminar will pass a teen court bar\nexam.\n\nobjective 2: All youth volunteers will be scheduled to participate in a teen court trial/hearing within\nthree months of passing their bar examination.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills of youth in the community.\n\nobjective 1: 30% of the ongoing youth volunteer pool will consist of past teen court defendants by the\nend of fiscal year 1996.\n\nobjective 2: 85% of youth volunteers will complete a six-week life skills class during fiscal year 1996.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders accountable.\n\nobjective 1: All referrals to the teen court program will be docketed and heard in teen court within five\nweeks of the referral.\n\nobjective 2: During fiscal year 1996, 80% of teen court defendants will successfully complete their\ncommunity service hours within 90 days of their sentence.\n\nobjective 3: 80% of all restitution payments scheduled to be made during fiscal year 1996 will be\ncollected.\n\nobjective 4: During fiscal year 1996, 60% of teen court defendants will complete a four-week victim\nawareness class.\n\nLong-term goal: Decrease the number of youth in the community engaging in alcohol and illegal drug\nuse.\n\nShort-term goal: Intervene early, provide education to, and promote awareness among youth of the\ndangers of substance abuse.\n\nobjective 1: During fiscal year 1996, 95% of all teen court defendants charged with an alcohol/drug\noffense will attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact panel.\n\nobjective 2: 80% of all teen court defendants will successfully complete a four-week substance abuse\nawareness program.\n\nobjective 3: A pretest and three-month followup test (designed to assess change in knowledge and\nattitude about alcohol and drug use among adolescents) will be administered to all\nparticipants of the substance abuse awareness program. 80% of participants will show a\npositive change in knowledge and attitude relative to alcohol and drug use.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n48 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe establishment of a program\u2019s purpose,\ngoals, and objectives is critical to effective\nprogram implementation and evaluation.\nWithout a carefully considered purpose and\ngoals, the program will lack a clear direction\nand eventually may find its existence called into\nquestion.\n\nThe sample purpose, goals, and objectives\nprovided in this chapter are based on the earlier\n\ndiscussion of the balanced approach mission.\nIndividual teen court programs should develop\nrealistic and achievable goals that reflect the\nprogram\u2019s philosophical basis, jurisdictional\ndifferences, and target population.  Establishing\nreasonable goals and objectives will require\nmore work during the planning and development\nstages to ascertain what improvement rates are\nachievable, given the program aims and\nresources.

These components serve as critical building blocks in presenting a well-thought-out proposal to potential funders.\n\n1. **Purpose**: The purpose of a program provides the foundational framework that sets the overall direction. It defines the broad aim of the program and answers why it exists. The purpose is essential in grant writing as it communicates the core essence and justification of the program to funders, helping them understand the overarching intent behind the initiative\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Goals**: Goals are broad, general statements that articulate the desired outcomes the program aims to achieve in the long run. They map out the future and provide a measure of success. Goals are essential in grants because they demonstrate the strategic endpoints of the program, giving funders a clear picture of the intended impact and aligning with their interests and priorities\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Objectives**: Objectives are specific, measurable steps that outline how the goals will be achieved. They are concise and detailed, often including specific targets and timelines. Objectives are crucial in grant proposals because they provide measurable benchmarks for evaluating the program&#x27;s success and accountability, ensuring that there are concrete criteria against which the program&#x27;s effectiveness can be assessed\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Part B: Grant Proposal Description for CLU Social Impact Innovation Fund\n\nIn pursuit of enhancing societal well-being, I propose to establish the &quot;Global Happiness Initiative Foundation&quot; (GHIF).

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.

Establishing\nreasonable goals and objectives will require\nmore work during the planning and development\nstages to ascertain what improvement rates are\nachievable, given the program aims and\nresources.  However, this investment of time and\neffort should pay off in the long run with a more\neffective program.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 49\n\nCHECKLIST FOR PROGRAM PURPOSE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES\n\nHave teen court program organizers or staff \u2014\n\n\u2751 Developed an understanding of the balanced approach mission and the restorative justice\nmodel?\n\nHoward Zehr (1990, pp. 230-231) developed the following \u201cRestorative Justice Yardstick\u201d as a\nmeans for providing juvenile justice agencies with guidance in moving closer to values and\npolicies consistent with the restorative justice model.

In particular, healthcare workers experience high rates of mental ill health such as burnout, stress, and depression due to workplace conditions including excessive workloads, workplace violence and bullying, which also produces negative effects on patients as well as on the happiness and wellbeing of those who remain at work. This review was undertaken to synthesize the evidence on workplace-based interventions at the organizational level promoting mental health and wellbeing among healthcare workers, to identify what has been receiving attention in this area and why, especially considering how such positive effects are produced. A search of three premier health-related databases identified 1290 articles that discussed healthcare workers, workplace interventions, and mental health. Following further examination, 46 articles were ultimately selected as meeting the criteria specifying interventions at the organizational level and combined with similar studies included in a relevant Cochrane review. The 60 chosen articles were then analyzed following a realist framework analyzing context, mechanism, and outcome. Most of the studies included in the realist review were conducted in high-income countries, and the types of organizational-level interventions studied included skills and knowledge development, leadership development, communication and team building, stress management as well as workload and time management. Common themes from the realist review highlight the importance of employee engagement in the intervention development and implementation process.

The absence of adequate and quality mental health infrastructure and workforce is increasingly recognized. The ethical implications of inequalities in mental health for people and nations are profound and must be addressed in efforts to fulfil key bioethics principles of medicine and public health: respect for individuals, justice, beneficence, and non-malfeasance. Stigma and discrimination against people living with mental disorders affects their education, employment, access to care and hampers their capacity to contribute to society. Mental health well-being is closely associated to several Millennium Development Goals and economic development sectors including education, labour force participation, and productivity. Limited access to mental health care increases patient and family suffering. Unmet mental health needs have a negative effect on poverty reduction initiatives and economic development. Untreated mental conditions contribute to economic loss because they increase school and work absenteeism and dropout rates, healthcare expenditure, and unemployment. Addressing unmet mental health needs will require development of better mental health infrastructure and workforce and overall integration of mental and physical health services with primary care, especially in the developing nations.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;E.

Our explanations fall into three categories: (1) work and economic conditions, (2) social-psychological resources, and (3) health lifestyle. We replicate analyses with two samples, cross-sectionally and over time, using two health measures (self-reported health and physical functioning). The first data set comes from a national probability sample of U.S. households in which respondents were interviewed by telephone in 1990 (2,031 respondents, ages 18 to 90). The second data set comes from a national probability sample of U.S. households in which respondents ages 20 to 64 were interviewed by telephone first in 1979 (3,025 respondents), and then again in 1980 (2,436 respondents). Results demonstrate a positive association between education and health and help explain why the association exists. (1) Compared to the poorly educated, well educated respondents are less likely to be unemployed, are more likely to work full-time, to have fulfilling, subjectively rewarding jobs, high incomes, and low economic hardship. Full-time work, fulfilling work, high income, and low economic hardship in turn significantly improve health in all analyses. (2) The well educated report a greater sense of control over their lives and their health, and they have higher levels of social support. The sense of control, and to a lesser extent support, are associated with good health. (3) The well educated are less likely to smoke, are more likely to exercise, to get health check-ups, and to drink moderately, all of which, except check-ups, are associated with good health. We conclude that high educational attainment improves health directly, and it improves health indirectly through work and economic conditions, social-psychological resources, and health lifestyle. he positive association between education and health is well established, but explanations for this association are not. Well educated people experience better health than the poorly educated, as indicated by high levels of self-reported health and physical functioning and low levels of morbidity, mortality, and disability. In contrast, low educational attainment is associated with high rates of infectious disease, many chronic noninfectious diseases, self-reported poor health, shorter survival when sick, and shorter life expectancy (Feldman, Makuc, Kleinman, and Cornoni-Huntley 1989; Guralnik, Land, Fillenbaum, and Branch 1993; Gutzwiller, LaVecchia, Levi, Negri, and Wietlisbach 1989; Kaplan, Haan, and Syme 1987; Kitagawa and Hauser 1973; Liu, Cedres, and Stamler 1982; Morris 1990; Pappas, Queen,&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

A person is happy with better relationships, financial stability, good mental health, and longevity. Disinformation, stigma, ongoing isolation, and disruption of daily activities are all quite prevalent. Any of these elements may impact one&#x27;s mental health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken several steps to address COVID&#x27;s mental health concerns. In addition to frontline healthcare personnel, who engage in dealing with COVID-19, the general population&#x27;s mental health was also at stake due to the unprecedented and catastrophic emergency of COVID. Various keywords, including MeSH terms, were used in PubMed and Google Scholar searches. This paper was based on previously available data and article searches on how COVID-19 affected the mental health of the general population and the elements that may influence it. Quarantine and self-isolation have been found to have affected people&#x27;s daily livelihoods and behaviors, leading to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, dejection, insomnia, risky alcohol and drug use, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. Many of the victims of COVID-19 who were critical survivors exhibited lasting psychological harm a year after being discharged, including high anxiety levels, melancholy, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Healthcare employees too experienced significant psychological consequences due to factors such as an excessive workload or the number of hours worked, inadequate personal safety equipment, overly enthusiastic media coverage, and a sense of being under-supported. As a result of this major disaster, mental health concerns have surfaced, perhaps leading to long-term health problems, loneliness, and guilt. To reduce this deportment, global health solutions should be used, particularly while executing the isolation/quarantine and dealing with the people with fear and vulnerability. The mental health of the general population should be at the forefront of any worldwide response.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Deepak Vishwakarma&quot;,&quot;A.

Psychosocial variables and social determinants both have an important role in determining a person&#x27;s health and well-being. The psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of these issues can have an impact on a person&#x27;s behavior and health. Stress, education, poverty, social exclusion, discrimination, and violence are a few examples of these psychosocial determinants. These elements can be protective or, on the other hand, raise the risk of physical and mental illness and lower people&#x27;s quality of life. Social determinants of health are a combination of social, economic, and physical factors. They play a role in determining the patterns of illness, disease, and health that are observed in a population. They establish the circumstances in which people are conceived, develop, live, work, and age. Health and medical care, economic security, social and communal context, local geography and built environment, and education are all examples of social determinants of health. The connection between individuals and their social and physical environments frequently worsens poor health outcomes. Low socioeconomic position, unemployment, strained family ties, and hazardous neighborhoods have been shown in studies to have a significant negative impact on mental health. Additionally, those who suffer from severe psychological disorders are more probable to experience social segregation, poverty, food insecurity and housing uncertainty all of which can decrease quality of life and\u00a0hamper rehabilitation. Pakistan experienced the largest gain among the SAARC nations between 2013 and 2018, increasing its happiness score by 26 points, and is expected to rank among the top 20 gainers globally in 2020 [2]. However, it lowers to 4.934from 2018-2020\u00a0and is ranked 105 out of 149 happiest countries. There could be a number of causes for this downward tendency. The need of the hour is to pinpoint the causes of Pakistan&#x27;s declining happiness level. These findings would help policymakers get rid of or manage the factors contributing to people&#x27;s lower levels of happiness. It is improbable to understate the importance of social and psychological factors in determining health. Healthcare systems and politicians may create initiatives that successfully promote well-being, lessen health inequities, and enhance overall health outcomes by understanding and addressing these variables. A healthier and more equal society must be built via comprehensive strategies that incorporate socioeconomic inequities and mental health care. In order to promote a more inclusive and sustainable society, the international community is making great progress towards reaching many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are covering several SDGs described by United Nations which include: SDG 1, \u201cNo Poverty\u201d; SDG 2, \\&quot;Zero Hunger\\&quot;; SDG 3, \\&quot;Good Health and Well-being\\&quot;; SDG 4, \\&quot;Quality Education\\&quot;; SDG 5, \\&quot;Gender Equality\\&quot;; SDG 8, \\&quot;Decent Work and Economic Growth\\&quot; and SDG 10, \\&quot;Reduced Inequalities\\&quot;. The elimination of poverty, hunger, and inequality, as well as the promotion of sustainable economic growth, are the top priorities behind these objectives. By achieving these objectives, we can collectively work towards a more sustainable and equitable future in which no one is left behind.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Riffat Mehboob&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2023,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Pakistan Journal of Health Sciences&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/impact-psychological-social-determinants-health-mehboob/159021fe111e5366b45f35adcb47cd5c/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.54393/pjhs.v4i07.896&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:5},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Happiness and health across the lifespan in five major cities: The impact of place and government performance.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;RATIONALE\\nA growing body of research suggests that urban design has an effect on health and well-being. There have been very few studies to date, however, that compare these effects across the lifespan.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\nThe current study examines the direct and indirect effects of the city environment on happiness. It was hypothesised that citizens&#x27; ratings of their city along dimensions of performance (e.g., basic - usually government - services related to education, healthcare, social services, and policing) and place (e.g., the beauty of the city and a built environment that provides access to cultural, sport, park, transport, and shopping amenities) would be significant predictors of happiness but that the nature of these effects would change over the lifespan.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\n5000 adults aged 25-85 years old living in Berlin, Paris, London, New York, and Toronto completed the Quality of Life Survey in 2007. Respondents reported their happiness levels and evaluated their city along place and performance dimensions.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe results of the study demonstrate an interesting, and complex relationship between the city environment and happiness of residents across the lifespan. Findings suggest that the happiness of younger residents is a function of having easy access to cultural, shopping, transport, parks and sport amenities and the attractiveness of their cities (i.e. place variables). The happiness of older residents is associated more with the provision of quality governmental services (i.e., performance variables). Place and performance variables also have an effect on health and social connections, which are strongly linked to happiness for all residents.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nYounger adults&#x27; happiness is more strongly related to the accessibility of amenities that add to the quality of a city&#x27;s cultural and place characteristics; older adults&#x27; happiness is more strongly related to the quality of services provided within a city that enable residents to age in place. These results indicate that, in order to be all things to all people, cities should emphasize quality services (e.g., good policing, schools, healthcare access), beauty and character, and provide easy access to transport amenities and cultural and recreational opportunities.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

Physical appearance is one of the first individual characteristics noticed by others and has an important impact on social interactions and therefore has become very important construct in contemporary societies. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the influence of physical exercise on the subjective well\u2010being dimension related to better health and eventually happiness. In contrast, the physical inactivity determined by the increasing amount of time spent in sedentary activities is becoming an issue with serious conse\u2010 quences, being the cause of more than 5 million death/year globally. Physical activ \u2010 ity favorably influences mental health, improves the emotional state and reduces the incidence and severity of diseases and pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and obesity. Promoting physical activity, physical and health education and sport as healthy lifestyle components in schools, universities and lifelong learning targets the enhacement of vigour, resilience, employement, and social outcomes for graduates and comunities. Motives of physi\u2010 cal inactivity were discussed aiming to underpin possible remedial solution for better health, quality of life and well\u2010being.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

Increased concern over student wellbeing has fostered the demand for positive education interventions \u2013 a relatively new topic requiring more research. We tested a positive psychology wellbeing intervention imbedded in undergraduate psychology classes with three studies and 469 participants. Intervention outcomes across three years indicate improvements in wellbeing, positive affect, negative affect and clinical wellbeing categories. Comparisons with an active control indicated the intervention buffered against semester stress. Practice frequency had little effect on wellbeing, however wellbeing gains were higher for students with low baseline wellbeing and those who valued happiness more \u2013 suggesting positive education interventions have greater value for some students.

Biomedical and psychological research has come a long way in identifying the importance of mental health and its impact on behavioral risk factors, physiological health, and overall quality of life. Despite this, access to psychological and psychiatric services remains widely unavailable and is a challenge for many healthcare systems, particularly those in developing countries. This review article highlights the strengths and opportunities brought forward by digital mental health in narrowing this divide. Further, it points to the economic and societal benefits of effectively managing mental illness, making a case for investing resources into mental healthcare as a larger priority for large non-governmental organizations and individual nations across the globe.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Manuel Faria&quot;,&quot;Stella Tan Pei Zin&quot;,&quot;Roman Chestnov&quot;,&quot;Anne Marie Novak&quot;,&quot;S.

Communicable diseases such as HIV, TB, Malaria and the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are impacting many of the world&#x27;s poorest and most vulnerable populations, and depressing economic development. Sickness and disease has decreased the size and capabilities of the workforce through impeding access to education and suppressing foreign direct investment (FDI). There is clear evidence that by investing in health improvements a significant increase in GDP per capita can be attained in four ways: Firstly, healthier populations are more economically productive; secondly, proactive healthcare leads to decrease in many of the additive healthcare costs associated with lack of care (treating opportunistic infections in the case of HIV for example); thirdly, improved health represents a real economic and developmental outcome in-and-of itself and finally, healthcare spending capitalises on the Keynesian &#x27;economic multiplier&#x27; effect. Continued under-investment in health and health systems represent an important threat to our future global prosperity. This editorial calls for a recognition of health as a major engine of economic growth and for commensurate investment in public health, particularly in poor countries.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

Health literacy refers to the ability to access, process, and use health information to make appropriate decisions to promote good overall health. Low levels of health literacy are associated with a host of negative outcomes such as less efficient use of healthcare services, higher healthcare costs, increased mortality, and poorer self-rated health. In those with medical conditions (e.g., diabetes), lower health literacy is linked with higher levels of depression. It is important to investigate whether mental health is linked to health literacy as understanding these links has the potential to identify those at risk for negative outcomes and thus implement protective strategies. Therefore, the current study sought to determine the extent to which various mental health constructs such as happiness, well-being, anxiety and depression are related to health literacy in a community-based sample of cognitively healthy individuals. We hypothesized that higher levels of health literacy would be associated with higher self-reported well-being, happiness, and lower anxiety and depression. Participants and Methods: Design - Cross-sectional, prospective study. Setting - Community-based. 93 individuals were included with mean age=59.02 years (SD=15.12) and mean education=15.70 (SD=2.39). 60% were women, the majority were White (55%) while 38% were Black and 7% belonged to other races; 90% were non-Hispanic. Measures: Health Literacy - Health literacy was measured by an 8-item instrument in the Rush Memory and Aging Project that examined the participant\u2019s understanding of health care, treatment, and related behaviors. Happiness - Happiness was measured by 5 items from the Satisfaction with Life Scale using a 7-point scale (1 = strongly agree; 7 = strongly disagree). Higher scores indicated lower levels of happiness. Well-being - Well-being was measured with an 18-item instrument from the Rush Memory and Aging project, with higher scores indicating better well-being. Statistics: Bivariate correlations between age, education, and mental health measures and health literacy were examined. Results: Higher level of health literacy was significantly associated with age (r = .282 p = .009) and education (r = .228 p = .039). Contrary to our hypothesis, health literacy was not significantly associated with happiness (r = .002 p = .987), well-being (r = .037 p = .742), depression (r = .005 p = .962) or anxiety (r = -.064 p = .568). Even after controlling for age and education, these associations remained significant. Conclusions: Higher level of healthy literacy was associated with older age and higher level of education. However, no significant association was found between health literacy and mental health measures of happiness, well-being, depression, and anxiety in cognitively healthy individuals, even after controlling for demographics. The lack of such associations in this study was unexpected and suggests that other factors such as the presence of health conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer) might critically contribute to such associations. Future studies should examine these associations in a larger context to better understand how to promote healthy self-care behaviors.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Miji A Suhr&quot;,&quot;Silvia Chapman&quot;,&quot;Jillian L.

The 46th West African College of Physicians Annual General and Scientific Meeting focuses on Health and Wellbeing Amidst a Prolonged Pandemic. Health and wellbeing are closely related components critical to healthy living and cannot be considered independent of each other. While health is a state of total wellbeing; wellbeing is intricately linked with happiness and satisfaction in life. The COVID- 19 pandemic has significantly impacted the health and well-being of nations all over the world. In the wake of the pandemic came the COVID-19 recession which brought a crash in the global economy, reduction in productivity, rise in unemployment, massive layoffs, collapse of businesses and manufacturing industries, disruptions in transportation and much more. These harsh economic realities have placed a huge strain on global mental health resulting in physical, mental and social disorders. The workload of the average physician and other health care workers increased tremendously resulting in burnout and psychological stress with a consequent increase in the incidence of psychological disorders including anxiety, depression, suicide and suicidal ideation amongst others. The lack of preparedness for the pandemic and the inequality in strength of healthcare systems across the world prolonged the pandemic and its adverse consequences on health and wellbeing of the populace. Promotion of health and well-being of health care professionals and the populace at large is essential for the growth of any economy and is an essential consideration for stakeholders involved in disease prevention and health promotion.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

If it does, what are the mechanisms by which education affects well-being? We propose that education improves well-being because it increases access to nonalienated paid work and economic resources that increase the sense of control over life, as well as access to stable social relationships, especially marriage, that increase social support. We examine the relationship between education and a variety of indicators of subjective quality of life-depression, anxiety, anger, aches and pains, malaise, and dissatisfaction. Using two representative national samples collected in 1990 and 1995, we find that the well educated have lower levels of emotional distress (including depression, anxiety, and anger) and physical distress (including aches and pains and malaise), but they do not have lower levels of dissatisfaction. Education reduces distress largely by way of paid work, nonalienated work, and economic resources, which are associated with high personal control; but the extent to which it reduces distress by way of marriage and social support is much more modest. We contrast distress and dissatisfaction as indicators of the subjective quality of life.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C. Ross&quot;,&quot;M. V.

However, the relationship between the SDOH and happiness of older adults have not received the requisite recognition in Ghana. This study examined the relationship between the SDOH and happiness of older adults in Ghana. Methods The study used data from the 2014/2015 Ghana Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) Wave 2. Data was analysed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique to investigate the direct, indirect and covariances of the SDOH and happiness of older adults. Results The results showed positive relationship between the SDOH and happiness among older adults. The economic stability ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.07), neighbourhood and built environment ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.02, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.001), access to quality education ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.56, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.01), access to healthy food ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.48, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.001) social and community context ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.41, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.05), and access to quality healthcare ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.80, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.001) had direct relationship with happiness of the older adults in Ghana. Conclusion This study shows that the conditions in which older adults were born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age (SDOH) positively impact their happiness in later life. Neighbourhood and physical environment influence the effect of quality education on happiness of older adults. Social policies and interventions aiming at happiness of older adults should consider the social determinants of health and the mediating effects of food on happiness through quality education, and quality of healthcare system.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

This study explored the relationship between these well-being constructs by applying widely used measures with satisfactory psychometric properties. Materials and Methods University students (n = 180) completed widely used well-being measures including the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ), the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. We analyzed the data using correlation, regression, and exploratory factor analysis. Results All included well-being measures demonstrated high loadings on the global well-being construct that explains about 80% of the variance in the OHQ, the psychological domain of Quality of Life and subjective well-being. The results show high positive correlations between happiness, psychological and health domains of quality of life, life satisfaction, and positive affect. Social and environmental domains of quality of life were poor predictors of happiness and subjective well-being after controlling for psychological quality of life. Conclusion Together, these data provide support for a global well-being dimension and interchangeable use of terms happiness, subjective well-being, and psychological quality of life with the current sample and measures. Further investigation with larger heterogeneous samples and other well-being measures is warranted.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;O. Medvedev&quot;,&quot;C. E.

Global health education programs should strive continually to improve the quality of education, increase access, create communities that foster excellence in global health practices, and ensure sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the University of Minnesota\u2019s extensive global health education programs, which includes a decade of hybrid online and in-person programing, to move completely online. We share our experience, a working framework for evaluating global health educational programming, and lessons learned. Over the decades we have moved from a predominantly passive, lecture-based, in-person course to a hybrid online (passive) course with an intensive hands-on 2-week requirement. The pandemic forced us to explore new active online learning models. We retained our on-demand, online passive didactics, which used experts\u2019 time efficiently and was widely accessible and well received. In addition, we developed a highly effective synchronous online component that we felt replaced some of the hands-on activities effectively and led us to develop new and innovative \u201chands-on\u201d experiences. This new, fully online model combining quality asynchronous and synchronous learning provided many unanticipated advantages, such as increasing access while decreasing our carbon footprint dramatically. By sharing our experience, lessons learned, and resources, we hope to inspire other programs likewise to innovate to improve quality, access, community, and sustainability in global health, especially if these innovations can help decrease negative aspects of global health education such as its environmental impact.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Kristina M.

A wide range of mental wellness programmes have been explored to provide students with pleasant and satisfying experiences. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of integrating Zen meditation and music listening on the mindfulness and happiness levels of university music therapy students. A qualitative methodology was used, and data were collected through surveys and semi-structured interviews. To investigate various aspects of data regarding the role of the meditation and music (MM) programme for mindfulness and happiness, this study used thematic analysis within a qualitative research design. The findings of this study suggest that the 8-week Mindfulness Meditation (MM) programme is a potential approach for enhancing mindfulness, happiness and stress management. These results carry broader implications, particularly in terms of supporting mental health resources in higher education. Furthermore, the study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the positive impact of combining meditation and music to promote mental well-being. This integrated approach has the potential to strengthen coping strategies and further promote the integration of music and meditation practices in various contexts, including higher education.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Mi Hyang Hwang&quot;,&quot;Leslie Bunt&quot;,&quot;Catherine Warner&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2023,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/meditation-music-programme-mindfulness-happiness-hwang/309b5b02fbec5cfa89395ccd3376a1a4/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.3390/ijerph20237140&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;20&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:20}]}"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"invoked_plugin": {"type": "remote", "namespace": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin", "plugin_id": "g-f1286ecb04957580332cda9bf386b57ef1b2ed6f", "http_response_status": 200}, "jit_plugin_data": {"from_server": {"type": "preview", "body": {"domain": "chat.consensus.app", "is_consequential": false, "privacy_policy": "https://consensus.app/home/privacy-policy/", "method": "get", "path": "/quick_search", "operation": "search_papers", "params": {"query": "impact of access to education, healthcare, and mental health resources on global happiness and well-being"}, "actions": []}}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "6262b46b-7fbf-4ec5-9a3d-4ef911e056ae", "request_id": "8826b7fae88c839a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "6262b46b-7fbf-4ec5-9a3d-4ef911e056ae", "children": ["9000f2ce-5c96-4f19-bf39-99151c7d1758"]}, "9000f2ce-5c96-4f19-bf39-99151c7d1758": {"id": "9000f2ce-5c96-4f19-bf39-99151c7d1758", "message": {"id": "9000f2ce-5c96-4f19-bf39-99151c7d1758", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715478245.579908, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Here are a couple of academic sources that support the claims and assertions made in Parts B and C of your document regarding the impact of access to education, healthcare, and mental health resources on global happiness and well-being:\n\n1. **Workplace-Based Organizational Interventions Promoting Mental Health and Happiness among Healthcare Workers: A Realist Review** - This paper discusses how workplace-based interventions at the organizational level promote mental health and wellbeing among healthcare workers, emphasizing the importance of mental health on happiness and wellbeing.

A comparison between a holidaytaking group and non-holidaytaking control group provided evidence that the former experienced a higher sense of well-being prior and post their travels when compared to the latter.

While the concept of QOL is contestable, a number of studies have revealed that travel can increase an individual\u2019s perceived and actual QOL. To date, the focus has been on vacation travel, highlighting that travel primarily for the purpose of rest or recreation, whether to a holiday destination or touring, is a component of many people\u2019s perceived QOL, and in some cases is a critical component. However, these more expensive forms of vacation travel are less accessible to those classified as socio-economically disadvantaged. Many such individuals can and do visit friends and relatives (VFR), suggesting that VFR may be a critical means by which socio-economically disadvantaged people can travel for pleasure and thereby maintain or improve their QOL. The article suggests a number of potential strategies based on the 8 Ps of the marketing mix, and these in turn inform avenues for future research.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Elisa Backer&quot;,&quot;B.

According to this approach, an individual&#x27;s behaviours, cognitions, and feelings about travelling are analyzed against the social background, that is, how the individual influences and is influenced by others. The main question is addressed to the motivation for recreational travel: why do people travel for recreation? Why do they choose this activity over others? While variations in motives can be found between and within individuals and between various types of travel (vacation versus weekend travel), the basic psychological mechanism is likely to be the same for most of recreational travel. It is shown that like leisure behaviour in general, recreational travel is a dialectical optimizing process, in which two forces simultaneously influence a person: the desire to leave the personal and/or interpersonal environment behind oneself and the desire to pursue or gain certain personal and/or interpersonal rewards.

Thus, the study aimed at assessing the impacts of physical activity on well-being during vacation by taking a longitudinal approach. We utilized a pre-post within-subject design (n = 101) by testing vacationers prior to, during, and after their vacation in an alpine environment. Therefore, a series of eight linear mixed model analyses of co-variance was performed. The results suggested that the duration of a vacation and the amount of physical activity have a positive impact on the components of well-being, which was expressed by changes in the activation, elation, excitement, and calmness subscales of the Mood Survey Scale. Demographic patterns did not reveal any influences. Physical activity might be a marker for well-being, which influences people\u2019s everyday life and leisure time behavior by motivating them to engage in more physical activity. This research extends the existing literature by (1) proving the effects of vacations on well-being, (2) pointing out the effects of demographic predeterminations, and (3) gathering in-depth knowledge about the role of physical activity in changes to well-being.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Philipp Schlemmer&quot;,&quot;C.

The effects of recreational travel on cognitive flexibility and originality&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Abstract Recreational travel may increase creativity by relieving workers from stress, providing diversifying experiences and increasing positive emotions. Consequently, vacations may boost creativity, apparent in a greater variety (flexibility) and originality of ideas after work resumption. In our longitudinal field study, creativity (measured by Guilford&#x27;s Alternative Uses Task; independently scored by three raters) was assessed in 46 workers before and after vacation. Potential precursors for creativity changes (i.e. work load, vacation hassles, vacation destination and positive affect) were also explored. Cognitive flexibility increased whereas originality remained the same after vacation. None of the precursors explained variance in creativity changes. Although vacations seem to increase chances on creative insights by raising the amount of available cognitive elements (flexibility), they do not necessarily lead to higher levels of originality (uncommon, remote and clever ideas). Research in larger samples is required to further explore mechanisms that may explain why travel seems to enhance creativity.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J. Bloom&quot;,&quot;S.

Recent research has provided considerable evidence that visits to near-natural everyday landscapes promote psychological and physical health. However, little is so far known about the effects of people\u2019s regular outdoor recreation in their local natural environment on their well-being and, in particular, on their psychological resilience. In our project we address this research gap by investigating nearby outdoor recreation behaviour in three urbanized regions in Switzerland, each of which has a different predominant culture and language (German, French and Italian speaking). A standardized questionnaire was sent to a random sample of residents ( N =1200) in each region. Stepwise regression supported the hypothesis that regular nearby outdoor recreation has a significant but rather marginal effect on respondents\u2019 reported well-being and their psychological resilience, even when systematically controlled. However, similar effect sizes, in particular in terms of psychological resilience, were found with other leisure activities. More generally, we found that well-being and psychological resilience were influenced by different factors, and that increasing psychological resilience mainly required a long duration of recreation or leisure activities. Management implications This paper provides robust evidence that urban inhabitants\u2019 regular outdoor recreation in the nearby natural environment has positive effects on their emotional well-being and their psychological resilience. The findings suggest that the quality of the nearby recreation area is at least an as important condition for these benefits as the easy access to these areas. Inhabitants\u2019 satisfaction with the recreation area, their activity level within the recreation areas as well as the time spent in the recreation areas appeared to be more relevant predictors for these benefits than the frequency of visits in these areas. Accordingly, managers should invest as much resources in increasing the quality of the recreation areas as in improving their accessibility.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

A fundamental perception, which is that going on holiday will enable people to satisfy their needs to rest and relax, exists. In a literature analysis it was determined that there is a definite link between leisure activities and improved psychological well-being, but the relationship between specific tourist and travel activities and improved psychological well-being has not yet been researched. There is also evidence that the holiday experience may not always foster happiness, satisfaction and relaxation, causing what is commonly known as the &#x27;holiday syndrome&#x27;. One of the outcomes of this research showed that up to 30% of the people going on pre-organised tours experienced a clear non-positive impact (not affected or negative impact) on their psychological well-being. Due to the importance of knowing why there are a significant number of tourists who return home feeling unaffected or worse after the holiday tours, possible reasons for the decrease in their well-being were explored. Main stress factors on the tours were identified as too tight time schedules, too little personal time and too much driving. \\nKeywords: Tourism, Tourist and travel activity, Psychological well-being, Happiness\\n South African Journal for Research in Sport, Physical Education and Recreation Vol.26(1) 2004: 97-106&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

However, the topic has recently started to be studied on the transportation research field. This increasing interest in recreation travel reflects the fact that the share of recreation trips is rapidly increasing in many countries, and is expected to further increase due to changes in socio-demographics, lifestyles and other dynamic processes. Besides, these activities generate trips, and when summed up with the usual daily commuting trips contribute to emission levels and congestion and consequently, to the decrease of mobility and quality of life. In the Randstad area these mobility problems are even greater. Because of changes in the offerings of leisure and tourism products and services, the associated travel may contribute increasingly to emissions and a better understanding of this behavior from the perspective of sustainable development is therefore highly relevant. The individual\u2019s travel behavior may change over time, given different family lifecycle stages. For instance, the arrival of the first child may change drastically the recreation decisions of a young couple. Based on the exposed, the goal of this research was to better understand agenda formation and the dynamics of specific facets of recreation behavior as a function of lifecycle, controlling for others. The facets that make part of the recreation agenda formation (such as destination, transport mode, etc) are strongly dependent from each other. Thus, it is important to capture this notion of portfolio choice when studying recreation decisions. In the context of this research, recreation includes both vacation (tourism) and out-of-home leisure activities. Several analyses were performed, based on four different sources of data. The first dataset is a panel called CVO collected by NBTC-NIPO, where 838 respondents were followed from 2002 to 2009. It collects information about the annual holiday behavior of Dutch people. Several analyses were performed with the goal of exploring the determinants of vacation agenda formation of different lifecycle groups. A Bayesian belief network (BN) was applied in order to find relationships between lifecycle stages and other variables of the vacation portfolio. The resulting network showed the direct and indirect relations between socio-demographic variables and the variables that make part of a vacation portfolio. Some clear relationships, largely consistent with the existing literature, were found. Overall, the results indicated the interdependencies between choice facets underlying vacation portfolios and their relationships with certain socio-demographic variables. The focus was then shifted to the individual level, with the development of two models meant to better understand agenda formation and the dynamics of specific facets as a function of lifecycle stages, controlling for other variables. These models account for heterogeneity in individual preferences (mixed logit model). The first model explored transport mode choice, and in addition, complementarity and substitution patterns between the transport mode alternatives. Results demonstrated that the proposed model formulation is valuable to analyze tourist\u2019s choices over time as it allows parameters associated with each variable to vary randomly across individuals. Coefficients showed that Dutch tourists prefer to use the car for their vacation trips. The other modes act as complements to the car, whereas they substitute each other when car is not used for vacation trips. This may indicate that respondents tend to adapt to the available transport mode options. Car ownership seems to affect the decisions of the other tourist components (destination, travel party etc). The same holds for the contrary, for households without a car or when the car cannot be used because of imposed constraints, e.g., a destination too far away, the public transport options will then act as substitutes to each other. Based on the empirical results of the estimated coefficients for the interactions between transport mode choice and the socio-demographic variables (lifecycle and income), some conclusions can be drawn. First, the differences in behavior given individual\u2019s lifecycle stages can be explained in general by flexibility/constraints given age and/or household composition. Furthermore, the interaction between the transport mode choice and income resulted in coefficients that increase linearly as income level increases. The findings from this study also suggest that transport mode choice is strongly associated to the overall vacation profile decisions, as most of the interaction effects between the dependent and independent variables are significant. The other model developed based on the second dataset investigated choice of vacation length of stay. This dynamic mixed logit model accounted for both state dependency and heterogeneity in respondent\u2019s preferences. Length of stay options included short (1 to 3 nights), medium (4 to 9 nights), long (10 nights or more) vacations, and the decision not to go on vacation in a particular month in a specific year, used as the reference level in the model specification. The effects of seasonality, income, lifecycle stages characteristics and the influence of past choices in the choice of vacation length of stay were explored. Seasonality effects were accounted with the inclusion of month-specific variables. Results indicate that Dutch vacationers have preferences for taking their vacation during the main holidays periods and warm seasons. As for lifecycle stages, it seems that vacation choices are rather affected by the age of the children present in the household than by the age of the parents. In the case of income, results are in line with expectations and with the results shown previously on the transport mode choice model: utility increases with increasing income levels. The second dataset was collected through an Internet-based survey, using a software developed by our research group. The aim was to better understand the determinants of vacation choice of a sample of students. A literature review was developed, followed by a descriptive analysis of the student\u2019s past and intended vacation behavior. Further, a stated choice portfolio experiment specifically to analyze the factors influencing transport mode choice of students in the context of their vacation behavior. Results of the multinomial logit model indicate that costs predominantly influence their portfolio choices, especially because of the advent of the low-fare airlines. The attributes that are significant tend to amplify the specific role of transport modes in general and low-fare airlines in particular. The reference-dependent model for airlines preference confirm this finding as price sensitivity for low-fare airlines was higher than for the other modes. The third dataset was collected using a web-based survey. The 838 respondents who participated in the CVO data collection were invited to complete an online survey with a set of additional questions regarding their vacation plans. The aim was to explore if there are differences between choice facets in terms of when they are planned and to analyze the effect of lifecycle stages, income and travel experience in the level of vacation planning. Estimated coefficients show that the probability of a facet being planned increases as time to the vacation trip decreases, and that are differences in terms of when different vacation facets are planned. The fourth dataset is about leisure activities (CVTO), collected in 2008 by NBTC-NIPO. A BN model was developed in order to find direct and indirect associations between the variables. Then, a binary mixed logit model accounting for heterogeneity in individual preferences was estimated; complementarity and substitution patterns between leisure purpose alternatives were analyzed. Results demonstrated that the proposed model formulation is valuable to analyze individual\u2019s choices over time as it allows parameters associated with each variable to vary randomly across individuals. In terms of such substitution and complementary relationships between activity purposes it was found that outdoor activities decrease the propensity to perform sports or hobbies/courses activities. However, it increases the propensity to perform fun shopping and going out/culture. Based on the empirical results of the estimated coefficients for the interactions between leisure activity purpose and socio-demographics variables, some conclusions can be drawn. First, the differences in behavior given individual\u2019s lifecycle stages are in general explained by the flexibility/constraints spectrum typical of each group. Gender and social class exerts a small influence on activity purpose choice, although there are some differences between alternatives. The findings from this study also suggest that leisure activity purpose choice is strongly associated to the activity-related variables as most of the interaction effects between the dependent and independent variables are significant. The analysis of the importance of each attribute to the overall utility of an alternative indicates that especially lifecycle stages and travel party strongly influences activity purpose choice. The overall results in relation to the influence of lifecycle stages on vacation and leisure activities choice suggest that the differences in behavior given individual\u2019s lifecycle stages are in general explained by the flexibility or constraints typical of each group. Time and budget availability, and imposed constraints given age and/or household composition are the main factors explaining these differences. A better understanding of agenda formation of individuals as a function of their lifecycle stage characteristics is therefore highly relevant from the perspective of urban sustainable development.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Ab Anna Grigolon&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2009,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/modeling-recreation-choices-family-lifecycle-grigolon/2262706938c85f158880b009bbc68151/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.6100/IR741235&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:8},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Towards the recovery mechanisms of leisure travel experiences: does the length of vacation matter?&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;ABSTRACT This research examines the recovery mechanisms of leisure travel experiences with a focus on the moderating role of vacation duration. Results from a sample of 509 US respondents shows that autonomy is a requisite in the link between tourism experiences and life satisfaction, while its effect on life satisfaction is mediated by passive and active tourism experiences. Another key finding is that shorter leisure trips tend to facilitate the passive route to life satisfaction, while longer trips can better facilitate the active route.

Within the scope of the physical-mental-social paradigm of active ageing, it has been shown that leisure activities contribute to older people\u2019s physical and psychological well-being. Tourism, which fits all definitions of leisure, has unique characteristics that mean it can connect the crucial aspects of healthy ageing identified in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE): psychological health, well-being, life satisfaction, and social networks. The positive effect of tourism on the quality of life of individuals over 65 years old, unrelated to any underlying clinical condition, was confirmed through the concept of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), measured with the results of self-administered questionnaires among a sample of people over 65 years of age and compared with the results for the reference population.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Manuela Vega-V\u00e1zquez&quot;,&quot;M.

In the popular media and within the broader academic community, tourism is often, and arguably unjustly, marginalized and regarded as frivolous leisure, or simply, a big business.3 Yet, tourism could be seen equally as a human activity focused on the pursuit of greater well\u2010being away from usual domiciles.4 Until recently, potential health and well\u2010being benefits of leisure tourism have not received sustained, cross\u2010disciplinary empirical attention.5,6 I am approaching this editorial as a social scientist specializing in well\u2010being and tourism research.

Experiences leading to these changes are mainly influenced by interactions with the \u2018other\u2019.

Study participants identified a range of social and health benefits, including maintaining social connections with family and friends, opportunities to participate in physical activity, and reducing stress. However, many of these trips are by car. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of private car ownership internationally, low-density urban development, and a poor public transport infrastructure. Social and recreational trips make up a sizeable proportion of domestic travel and are contributing to New Zealand\u2019s increasing rate of CO2 emissions. There is an obvious need to address the negative ecological impacts of human activity. Our findings suggest that alongside strategies to reduce CO2 emissions, it also is important to introduce measures to maintain the benefits from social and recreational travel.

Thus, recent studies in tourism have paid more attention to the benefits of travel experiences. However, most studies pertaining to the topic have been conducted in the fields of organizational behavior and health science. Therefore, this research attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the health and wellness benefits of travel. The results revealed that positive effects of travel experiences on perceived health and wellness have been demonstrated by multiple studies. These benefits have been found to gradually diminish after a vacation. It was also found that there is a lack of research demonstrating the positive effect of travel experiences on physical health.

Having a holiday may be a good way to reduce work-related stress and reduced mood and improve perceived immune fitness. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess the impact of having a holiday or work on perceived immune fitness and mood. A survey was held among N = 246 young adults who were on holiday in Fiji, and N = 87 subjects who were in Fiji for work. The sample comprised both students and individuals with a job at home. Past year immune status was assessed with the Immune Status Questionnaire (ISQ). Current perceived immune functioning and mood were rated from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent). Assessments were made for two occasions: (1) the current situation (in Fiji), and (2) at home (before traveling). Compared to being at home, both students and working individuals on holiday in Fiji reported significantly improved immune fitness and significantly improved mood. For example, both groups reported reduction of stress of about 60% while in Fiji. In students who came to Fiji for work or spending a holiday, improvements in perceived immune fitness were more pronounced than in working people coming on holiday in Fiji. In contrast, working people on holiday reported greater improvements in mood compared to students. The magnitude of improvements were significantly greater among women than men. In conclusion, the data suggest that both having a holiday or working in Fiji is associated with significant improvements of mood, which were themselves associated with improved immune fitness. The findings are of importance for the tourism industry as they demonstrate that, in addition to leisure (or being active) as a purpose for having a holiday, the observed mental health benefits and improved perceived immune fitness provide an additional motive to have a holiday.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Individual and societal well-being are critical indicators of social sustainability. However, little attention, from both a research and policy perspective, has been paid to the impacts of transportation on well-being. With extensive urban expansion resulting from rapid urbanization, commuting has become a physical and mental burden for many residents in the megacities of China because of increasing travel distances and worsening travel experiences. This study aims to contribute to the growing literature on the relationship between transportation and well-being and also to quantitatively test this relationship in the Chinese context using data from a survey conducted in Xi-an, a mega-city of western China. The results from a structural equation modeling analysis suggest that travel characteristics, including travel mode choice and level of service, significantly influence travel satisfaction, and in turn significantly affect overall satisfaction of life. These findings highlight the importance of transportation-related strategies on improving well-being.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R. Ye&quot;,&quot;H.

That is a world to which all of us can aspire\nand for which we can work, for the sake of our grandchildren\u2019s futures and\ntheirs. Read and lift your expectations; a saner world is possible, and surely\nmost desirable. \n\n\u2014 RAY ANDERSON, Founder and Chairman of Interface, Inc. \n\nMark Anielski does a wonderful job in laying bare the difference between\nmoney and genuine wealth and relating them to our economic growth addic-\ntion. It sounds easy but we all need a lot of training in the use of economic\nconcepts if we are going to be able to find a cure for the monetary madness in\nthis world. \n\n\u2014 OSCAR KJELLBERG, President &amp; CEO, JAK Members Bank, Stockholm\n\nAn inspired and readable inquiry into an \u201coikonomia for the people.\u201d Great\nquestions, with a wealth of perspectives and insightful answers. \n\n\u2014 RAFFI CAVOUKIAN, C.M., singer, author, ecology advocate, \nfounder of Child Honouring \n\nIt is essential that we transform our societies from ones that worship greed\ninto ones that are sustainable, compassionate, and peaceful. The Economics of\nHappiness provides a rationale for beginning this journey immediately and of-\nfers a detailed methodology for measuring our progress along the path. \n\n\u2014 JOHN PERKINS, New York Times bestselling author of Confessions of an \nEconomic Hit Man and The Secret History of the American Empire\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page i\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Happiness will spark an important discussion about one of the\nmajor challenges of our time: how to achieve a balanced, sustainable way of\nlife, where notions of progress and genuine wealth are understood as being\nfundamentally interrelated. To help us on this journey, Mark Anielski points\nto the promise of transformational work in raising our understanding about a\nnew perspective for how we conduct our present and future. \n\n\u2014 HON. ROY ROMANOW, P.C., O.C., Q.C., Former Premier of Saskatchewan,\nChair, Canadian Index of Wellbeing Network Board\n\nIf those who set the goals of society and measure success in reaching them \nbehaved rationally, they would long since have ceased to use per capita Gross\nDomestic Product as the major guide. Until now there has been no full-scale\nstudy demonstrating this and developing a more appropriate alternative.\nWith The Economics of Happiness, the last shred of justification for the exclusive\nfocus on market activity is gone. If this focus is continued, that can only mean\nthat those who profit from our wearing blinders control policy. \n\n\u2014 JOHN B. COBB, JR., theologian and co-author of For the Common Good\n\nWhat is the purpose of our economy and our work if not to support happy\nlives? The Economics of Happiness shows how far we have drifted from that goal\nand details ways to get back on the path to happiness in our personal lives, \nin our businesses and in economic policy.\n\n\u2014 GIFFORD PINCHOT III, Founder and President, \nBainbridge Graduate Institute\n\nReading The Economics of Happiness is a real treat; it is not often that one finds\necomonics, philosophy and ethics brought together so closely. \u201cBeggar the\nnext generation\u201d is no longer acceptable in resource policy. In other words,\nmake room for ethics. That is the message throughout this book.\n\n\u2014 RT. HON. EDWARD R. SCHREYER, P.C., C.C., C.M.M., O.M., C.D\nformer Premier of Manitoba, \n\nformer Governor General of Canada \n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page ii\n\n\n\nFor far too long the economics profession has held sway over our society, and\nconvinced us to worship the god of endless economic growth. In this power-\nful, insightful book, Mark Anielski exposes how this approach actually stunts\nour growth and prevents us from achieving a life that is rich in all senses of\nthe word. Breaking ranks with his fellow economists, Anielski shows how we\ncan make the economy serve the interests of society, not the other way around. \n\n\u2014 LINDA MCQUAIG, author and journalist\n\nMark Anielski\u2019s The Economics of Happiness provides an interesting and inform-\native look at money, economics, wealth and what it all means. The lessons in\nthis book provide a timely guide as our society begins the paradigm shift\naway from crass consumer capitalism toward more sustainable economies and\ncommunities where people and the planet matter. \n\n\u2014 DEAN KUBANi, Environmental Programs Manager \nfor the City of Santa Monica\n\nIn these times, even the best of us are falling short in courageously charting\nnew maps \u2014 and more importantly avoiding heading out without a map at\nall! Mark Anielski is a great pioneer of our time, and The Economics of Happi-\nness is \u201cthe emperor has no clothes\u201d rallying cry our world so desperately\nneeds. This book is a critical part of the architecture of a new system. It is a\nmust read for anyone serious about living differently with each other and the\nplanet. Quite simply \u2014 LOVE is the only true economics, and when we ex-\npress love it does not get used up, it multiplies.  \n\n\u2014 ANITA M. BURKE, Sustainability Elder and former Senior Advisor to the\nCommittee of Managing Directors at Shell International\n\nThe Economics of Happiness helps organizations evolve from satisfying \u201cShow\nme the money!\u201d demands from shareholders to satisfying \u201cShow me the gen-\nuine wealth!\u201d demands from stakeholders. Mark Anielski has provided a\ntimely guidebook for organizations undertaking that challenging journey.\nThis book is a must-read for enlightened business leaders. \n\n\u2014 Bob Willard, author of The Sustainability Advantage and \nThe Next Sustainability Wave\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page iii\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Happiness joins leading voices critical of the dominant econom-\nic paradigm, but it does much more than this. Being a critic is easy enough,\nand so is dreaming dreams. But designing the practical and modelled path to\nconnect the two in different and meaningful strategic alternatives, is the\nwork of exceptional people, and I rank Mark Anielski as one of these.\n\n\u2014 PROFESSOR MARILYN WARING, Institute of Public Policy, \nAuckland University of Technology\n\nMark Anielski is one of those rare Canadians, an economist/civil servant who\ncut loose from the system and became a true public servant. He did so by\nfollowing his values. In so doing he changed his own life, and we are all the\nbeneficiaries. The Economics of Happiness pushes economics back to its more\nhonorable roots and, in so doing, shows us the way towards what is truly a\nnew common wealth. \n\n\u2014 BOB WILLIAMS, Senior Research Fellow, \nVancouver City Savings Credit Union \n\nWe live in a world where money, always a means for something else, has become\na goal in itself. We need, now more than ever, an economic framework that\nhelps us remember what economy is all about: careful use of life sustaining\nresources to ensure love and happiness. Why has no one thought to write such\na book before? \n\n\u2014 KARL-HENRIK ROB\u00c8RT, MD, PhD, \nFounder of  The Natural Step International, \n\nAdjunct Professor of Sustainable Product Developoment, \nBlekinge Institute of Technology\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/26/2007  12:21 PM  Page iv\n\n\n\nNEW SOCIETY PUBLISHERS\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page v\n\n\n\nCataloging in Publication Data:\nA catalog record for this publication is available from the National Library of Canada.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2007 by Mark Anielski.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nCover design by Diane McIntosh.

Peter, an immigrant to\nCanada from Austria in the early 1920s, was a gardener all his life. He under-\nstood what made life worthwhile: the value of time spent with those he loved\nand in the many gardens he nurtured.\n\nTo my parents, Hans-Ulrich and Mary Ann Anielski, who taught me\nhow to dream and act on my dreams with conviction and leadership. They\ntaught me about how to live a life of faith, love, meaningful relationships and\nabout the virtue of meaningful, life-giving work as vocation. \n\nTo my life partner and wife, Jennifer Haslett, who has taught me the joys\nof love and reciprocal relationship; of reconciliation, laughter and most im-\nportantly of open and honest dialogue. And to our two daughters Ren\u00e9e and\nStephanie, who teach me every day about unconditional love and real hap-\npiness. Like my Opa and our elders, my children are teaching me how to\ncelebrate life in the moment of experience and how to breathe love in each\nprecious second of living. Children have a remarkable gift for asking tough\nquestions; this book is dedicated to answering some of those questions which\nstill linger into adulthood.\n\nLike the book of life, this book is the result of years of many wonderful\nconversations and enduring relationships with friends and colleagues around\nthe world. I would like to thank David Korten for encouraging me to write\nthis book and my students at Bainbridge Graduate Institute near Seattle,\nespecially Kate Kaemerle who took the \u0160rst steps with me on this journey by\ncompelling me to \u201cwrite it down, Mark!\u201d To Chris and Judith Plant and\nIngrid Witvoet of New Society Publishers for believing in my message. To\nBetsy Nuse, my wonderful editor whose loving edits have helped shape this\nbook into a crystal of wisdom. To Sue Custance and Diane McIntosh for the\nexquisite cover design that adorns this book, including the idea for a\n\nxiii\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/26/2007  12:21 PM  Page xiii\n\n\n\nFibonnaci sequence which is the golden ratio revealed in nature especially\n\u0161owers. To Jane Haslett, my mother-in-law whose unwavering dedication to\nthe initial edits of this book and her wonderful encouragement continually\nbuoyed my spirit. And to many other friends and colleagues who have in-\nspired and shared in my spiritual and earthly journey including Judi Hoyt,\nRobertFelty,AaronBraaten,AnitaBurke, JoeyHundert,MichaelHaynes,Bill\nHarder, Ernie Zelinski, Orest Andre, Dominic Misho, Boudewijn Wegerif\n(deceased), Jeff Wilson, Kelvin Hirsch, Randy Hirsch, Steve Janzen, Derek\nRasmussen, Pat Klak, Bernard Lietaer, Libba and Gifford Pinchot III, Pat\nCarmack, Mel Hurtig, Oscar Kjellberg, Karl-Heinrik Robert, Leslie Christ-\nian, Bob Willard, Bob Williams, Herman Daly, John Cobb Jr., Ken Chap-\nman, Marilyn Waring, Hazel Henderson, Janine Benyus, Linda McQuaig,\nHarold Wynne, Brian and Mary Nattrass, Michael Percy, Colin Soskolne, Bill\nRees, Dan Rubenstein, Sandra Zagon, Laszlo Pinter, John Rudolph, Edward\nSchreyer, Susan Sharpe, John McMurtry, Rob Smith, Sara Wilson, Rob Taylor,\nHeather Tischbein, Amy Taylor, Rob Macintosh, Peter Haslett, Joy Hecht,\nJohn Helliwell, Robert Putnam and Raf\u0160 Cavoukian. To all the others whom\nI treasure as friends \u2014 for real wealth is measured in terms of enduring rela-\ntionships.\n\nThis book is intended to inspire both current and future builders of the\nnew economy of well-being in the genuine pursuit of happiness and spiritual\nwell-being. I believe our hearts intuit better ways that are in genuine align-\nment with our core values to design, measure and manage our personal, com-\nmunity and world economies. We know that life is more than consumption\nand having more material possessions. We long to build living economies\nfounded on the premise of well-being that are just, sustainable and \u0161ourish-\ning; a society which is guided by the virtues of love, respect, shared responsi-\nbility, forgiveness, stewardship, cooperation, reciprocity, giving and receiving\nand restorative justice. This book is offered to those hearts and minds alive\nwith understanding the wisdom of the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II, Mother\nTheresa and St. Thomas Aquinas who teach us that love is the ultimate source\nof enduring power in the universe. \n\nMy \u0160nal thanks go to God and the Holy Spirit whose loving kindness\ntaught me to get out of the way of my own ego and sense of knowing and to\nrealize that all things come down to a singular breath: LOVE.\n\nxiv The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xiv\n\n\n\nxv\n\nForeword\nby Herman Daly\n\nSUPPOSE THAT GOD sent an auditor to Earth to review the accounts of indi-\nviduals, \u0160rms, municipalities, and nations, with the purpose of assessing\n\ntheir stewardship of Creation and their success in converting resources into\ngood lives lived abundantly, righteously, and joyfully. What accounts or\nledgers would this auditor want to review, and by what criteria would he\njudge their adequacy? In reading this book I could not help thinking of Mark\nAnielski as \u201cGod\u2019s auditor.\u201d I do not want to attribute to Mark any divine au-\nthority or ability (he certainly does not claim such), nor am I sure that the\nAlmighty would not ask for some parts of the report to be redone. Of course\nan omniscient God has no need of an auditor\u2019s report, and the intended audi-\nence and bene\u0160ciary of the audit is us human beings.\n\nThe main criterion guiding the audit is \u201cgenuine well-being\u201d which is\nderived from \u201cgenuine wealth,\u201d which in turn consists of \u0160ve capital accounts\nthat assess both the quantity and quality of each type of capital. These \u0160ve\ncapitals are: (1) human capital \u2014 individual minds, bodies, spirits and their\ncapabilities; (2) social capital \u2014 quality and strength of our relations in com-\nmunity: trust, honesty, common values, including tolerance; (3) natural capi-\ntal \u2014stocks and funds of things in nature that yield \u0161ows of natural resources\nand life-supporting ecosystem services; (4) built capital \u2014machines, tools,\ndurable consumer goods; (5) \u0160nancial capital \u2014 money and other liquid as-\nsets, fungible and acceptable for payment of transactions and debts.\n\nOur current system of national accounts focuses on (5), pays some atten-\ntion to (4), and ignores (1), (2), and (3). The problem is that it is the \u0160rst three\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xv\n\n\n\nthat are most responsible for genuine well-being. While there is some mar-\nginal substitution possible among these different forms of capital (often\noveremphasized by economists who advise not to worry about depleting, say,\nnatural capital as long as you accumulate an \u201cequal amount\u201d of built capital\nor human capital), it is important to recognize, as Anielski does, that the dif-\nferent forms of capital are mainly complementary. A shortage of any one lim-\nits the productivity of the others. In particular \u0160nancial capital quickly be-\ncomes worthless as natural capital is excessively depleted. And a lack of trust\n(social capital) limits the value of knowledge (human capital), etc. The fact\nthat \u0160nancial capital is the most measurable category has biased our attention\ntoo much in its direction. But just how measurable is money really? Do we\nmean M1, M2, or M3, and what kind of measuring rod is it that can be created\nout of nothing and then destroyed, and while it exists can become longer or\nshorter? We must not make a fetish out of measurability. What really counts\nis often not countable. Assets can be recognized and celebrated and main-\ntained and cared for even if we cannot add and subtract them.\n\nAnielski learns from many people: from Luca Pacioli the Italian inventor\nof double-entry bookkeeping, from Karl-Henrik Robert of the Natural Step,\nand Mathis Wackernagel of the Ecological Footprint analysis, and from many\nothers, including even me, which makes this old professor feel good. He looks\nat examples ranging from Ray Anderson\u2019s Interface Carpet Co. with its eco-\nlogical closed loop materials accounting, to China and the idea of xiaokang, or\nthe\u201cmoderatelywelloff society\u201dasanalternativetotheever-growing economy.\nHe studies the Italian province of Emilia Romagna, the Inuit, Bhutan, and\nthe city of Santa Monica. The style ranges from textbook to personal memoir,\nto philosophical re\u0161ection, but all aimed at elucidating and applying the con-\ncept of Genuine Wealth.\n\nSo, gentle reader, I will take up no more of your time with further sum-\nmary and endorsement. After all, you now have the book in your hands, so by\nall means read it carefully. You will be glad you did.\n\n\u2014 Herman E. Daly\n\nHerman E.

Each of us has our own unique journey in discovering these ultimate\n\nends. But what are the determinants of happiness and our conditions of well-\nbeing \u2014 our genuine wealth? What, as Robert Kennedy challenged, makes\nlife worthwhile? How might we measure our happiness and incorporate these\nmeasures into conventional economic measures of progress like the GDP? \n\nPrompted by such nagging questions I began a journey into the origins\nof economic thought and economic systems. I realized that economics is more\nlike a religion than either art or science. The more I probed its tenets, the\nmore the scales of economic dogma fell from my own eyes and the eyes of\nthose with whom I shared my ideas. In a sense our hearts began to open to\ntruths that have long been sti\u0161ed.\n\nWhile some have de\u0160ned economics as the dismal science, I \u0160nd it akin\nto religion precisely because economic principles and tools form the guidance\nsystem of our modern states. Economists are the high priests of our capitalist\nsystems. I count myself among the economic priesthood \u2014 but I am a priest\nwho longs to understand the very premises and value-origins of our thought.\nAs a professor of business and economics, I have found a hunger among my\nstudents to understand more clearly the articles of faith behind business prac-\ntices. Many students question whether pro\u0160t and \u0160nancial wealth maximiza-\ntion should be the primary goals of business; they long for a more meaningful\nworld where corporations are governed by ethics and principles of social and\nenvironmental responsibility. I am buoyed by this new generation of business\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xvii\n\n\n\nand economic graduates who understand at the heart level that the current\n\u201cnew world order\u201d can and must change.\n\nIn economics we have reduced humanity to a collection of individual, in-\ndependent, utility maximizing creatures. Success is de\u0160ned by the accumula-\ntion of material and \u0160nancial wealth over a lifetime. We are born into this free\nmarket ideology without questioning its morality or ethical foundations. So\nwatermarked is this spirit of economics and capitalism on our lives that even\nthough our hearts cry out for a more meaningful and genuine existence, we\nare sucked back into the squirrel cage of capitalism, running faster and faster\nto \u201ckeep up with the Jones,\u201d lamenting as we imagine a simpler, more mean-\ningful, more genuine life. \n\nI \u0160rmly believe we are at an important tipping point in human history. A\nshared consciousness is emerging which will be supported by enlightened,\nlife-af\u0160rming economics. This book presents my future vision: stewardship of\nwhat I call Genuine Wealth \u2014 those conditions of well-being that align with\nour heartfelt values about what makes life worth living. \n\nThe Economics of Happiness has four primary goals.First, I explore the nature\nand spirit of the current economic system. I want to better understand why\nmany in the sustainability movement can\u2019t seem to move towards a genuine,\nliving and sustainable economic system. I wonder how Adam Smith\u2019s seminal\neconomics text,TheWealth of Nations, failed toconsider theOldEnglishorigins\nof theword\u201cwealth,\u201dwhichliterallymeans\u201ctheconditionsofwell-being.\u201d The\nimportant work of Amitore Fanfani traced economic and capitalistic think-\ning back to the European Middle Ages where Fanfani located a pre-capitalist\nmodel that the sustainability movement may \u0160nd desirable.\n\nMy second goal is to introduce the concept of Genuine Wealth: a new\nand compelling model for managing our personal, household, business and\ncommunity well-being in accordance with the values that de\u0160ne our quality\nof life. Genuine Wealth is a practical system which measures and manages for\nsustainability the total capital assets of a community or organization. Syn-\nthesizing emerging concepts like natural capital and social capital, Genuine\nWealth creates a more comprehensive accounting system where human, so-\ncial, natural, built and \u0160nancial capital are all integrated into the balance sheet.\nThis vision of a living, sustainable economy is founded on the mutually rein-\nforcing and integrated principles of ef\u0160ciency, equity and reciprocity and was\ninspired by the cooperative economy of Emilia Romagna, a \u0161ourishing and\nvibrant region of Italy.\n\nxviii The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xviii\n\n\n\nThirdly I provide examples of applications of the Genuine Wealth model\nat the personal/household, corporate/business, community, state/provincial\nand national scales. I present stories from Nunavut in Canada\u2019s Arctic, the City\nof Santa Monica, California and Leduc, Alberta and explore systems like the US\nGenuine Progress Indicators (GPI) and the Alberta GPI Sustainable Well-\nbeing Accounting System.\n\nFourthly I examine the nature of money and the current debt-based\nbanking system. Mountains of unsustainable debt and the practice of charg-\ning interest on loans actually lead to the destruction of living capital and\nfundamentally undermine sustainable economies of well-being and happi-\nness. I offer examples of alternatives to the current banking systems like the\nJAK Members Bank in Sweden, a cooperative member-owned bank that does\nnot charge interest on loans. I present a Genuine Wealth money and banking\nmodel that returns the power of money creation to the people in community.\nMoney could be created to serve the genuine needs of an economy of happi-\nness, and private banks, by providing wise \u0160nancial counsel to households\nand businesses, could contribute directly to the development of genuine\neconomies of well-being.\n\nWhile there is a growing library of books about sustainability, I offer\nhere a new paradigm which is also a pragmatic system for the management\nand stewardship of the common wealth of nations. While other books might\ndespair at the sad state of the world and our environment, The Economics of\nHappiness holds out hope that a genuine renaissance in economics, accounting\nand business practices is possible and that you and I can build communities of\ngenuine well-being and happiness, a vision that is shared by many. This book\nis optimistic and predicated on faith that people of all nations understand in-\ntuitively what needs to change in order for humanity to move towards a more\nsustainable future.\n\n\u2014 Mark Anielski\n\nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada\n\nIntroduction xix\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xix\n\n\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xx\n\n\n\n1\n\nChapter 1\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth\n\nMany people have asked me \u201chow did you get to where you are?\u201d\nMy professional background includes economics, forestry, accounting\n\nand religious studies. After three university degrees and years working as a\nprofessional economist, I have developed an overview of the ways economic\nsystems operate throughout the world. In my inquiry into economic systems\nI continue to ask the simple question \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Why do economists, \u0160nancial analysts, politicians and media \u0160xate on\ngrowth measures (such as the GDP or gross domestic product) as the key\nindicator of human progress? \n\n\u2022 Why do economy and stock market indices have to keep growing if a com-\nmunity has achieved levels of material self-suf\u0160ciency and quality of life?\n\n\u2022 What is money and where does it come from? \n\u2022 Why is money always scarce? \n\u2022 What\u2019s wrong with a steady-state, subsistence economy which has\n\nachieved suf\u0160ciency and homeostasis? \n\u2022 Why does free-market, capitalist economics look more like a cancer cell\n\nthan the self-renewing life cycle of an ancient forest? \n\u2022 What is driving our more-growth, more-consumption obsession? \n\u2022 Why aren\u2019t economists and our leaders asking hard questions: more\n\ngrowth of what? for whom? \n\nThese are just some of the questions I began to ask myself as an economist\nworking in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a senior government\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 1\n\n\n\neconomic policy analyst at Alberta Environment my primary task was to de-\nrive monetary value for Alberta\u2019s natural capital assets or natural resources;\nmany of them, like wilderness, had no price in a market. I was puzzled that\nwe had to reduce the value of everything to a monetary \u0160gure so it could\ncount. If something had no monetary value \u2014 like the joy of a wilderness ex-\nperience or the sight of a grizzly bear \u2014 did this mean that it was worthless?\nI began questioning the meaning of the word value. I was learning that there\nmight be market and non-market values. Economist and author Marilyn\nWaring offered my \u0160rst plain language lesson in the art of national income ac-\ncounting and the shortcomings of the gross domestic product (GDP) as a\nmeasure of progress.1 Marilyn noted that if you want fantastic GDP growth\nyou would deliberately crash an oil tanker like the Exxon Valdez into an\nAlaskan reef rather than deliver its cargo of oil safely to a Seattle port. Mari-\nlyn was the \u0160rst economist to point out to me the origins of the word value\n(from the Latin valere meaning \u201cshowing worth\u201d). Her warnings about the\nshortcoming of the GNP (the gross national product, the GDP\u2019s cousin) as a\nmeasure of progress had been voiced by Robert Kennedy in 1968 just a few\nweeks before his untimely assassination. Kennedy lamented that while the\nGNP might be great at adding up all the money we spend on goods and serv-\nices in an economy, it was a lousy measure of what mattered most to Ameri-\ncans: their quality of life. No other politician has given such a poignant cri-\ntique of the world\u2019s key measure of progress.2 For me, Kennedy\u2019s rebuke was\na clarion call to research and develop better systems of measuring human\nprogress and well-being that make common sense to average citizens and\nalign with their values.\n\nLearning about natural capital and sustainability\nWith these insights, I began to examine new models for measuring progress,\nsustainability and well-being. I began to explore new methods for accounting\nor measuring sustainability, \u0160rst focused on natural capital and then expand-\ning into other forms of capital accounting including human capital (like\ntime, knowledge and health) and social capital3 (like trust and the strength of\nrelationships). In 1991 I discovered the pioneering work of Robert Repetto at\nthe World Resources Institute in Washington. Repetto argued that account-\nants should treat nature\u2019s capital in the same way they treat manufactured or\nproduced capital like buildings, equipment and computers. Accounting\nshould acknowledge that nature\u2019s capital \u2014 like forests, oil and agricultural\n\n2 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 2\n\n\n\nsoils \u2014 can either depreciate (that is, be depleted or degraded) or appreciate\n(that is, grow in volume or quality). Repetto\u2019s primary argument made good\nsense. I began to ask \u201cwhy don\u2019t we keep a balance sheet for nature\u2019s capital\nassets like forests, oil, gas, coal, wildlife, water and soils that are so vital to\nAlberta\u2019s and Canada\u2019s economy?\u201d I reasoned that economists ignored the\nvalue of nature\u2019s capital either because it was too hard to measure or count or\nbecause it was politically expedient.\n\nWith my curiosity piqued, I began informally examining Alberta\u2019s nat-\nural assets beginning with forests, oil/natural gas and carbon. Were Alberta\u2019s\nforests being managed sustainably? How many years of oil and natural gas\nsupply did Alberta have left? My preliminary results suggested that Alberta\u2019s\nforests might be approaching an unsustainability threshold: more trees were\nbeing harvested and destroyed by \u0160re and insects than the reported annual\ngrowth of the total forest. More disconcertingly, I lacked con\u0160dence in the an-\nnual growth rate of the forest. That was akin to lacking con\u0160dence in the rev-\nenue line on a conventional income statement or the interest rate on my bank\naccount! When I looked at oil and gas natural capital accounts, I was shocked\nto discover that the reserve life or years of future production of conventional\noil and natural gas left, at current production rates, was shrinking rapidly.\nBy my calculations Alberta would exhaust its precious oil and gas reserves\nwithin 12 years without new discoveries. Without information which natural\ncapital accounting provides to guide economic policy decisions, how could\nAlberta decision makers insure the long-term sustainability of Alberta\u2019s nat-\nural capital assets? How could there be so little interest shown in natural cap-\nital accounting practices by a government committed to accountability and\nperformance measurement? \n\nIn constructing these early natural capital accounts I learned an impor-\ntant lesson. While we had mountains of data and information, we seemed to\nlack the wisdom or capacity to understand what all the information was\ntelling us about sustainability. We had lost sight of the forest, so focused were\nwe on making money on the harvesting and export of trees. I realized that\nthere was an important role for accountants and economists to play in devel-\noping new capital accounting tools to assess the long-term sustainability of\nnature\u2019s capital assets as well as human and social capital. Economists could\nbegin developing revised national income accounts and adjusted GDP \u0160gures\nthat counted natural, human and social capital depreciation. I knew that such\naccounts could be constructed from the data we currently collected on the\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 3\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 3\n\n\n\nphysical state of our forests and other natural capital. Yet I knew that, like all\nmajor changes, a move to incorporate natural capital into the balance sheet of\nthe nation would be faced with resistance and reluctance to change. Fortu-\nnately almost 15 years later, the term natural capital has been popularized by\nothers (including by the Canada West Foundation in Calgary). Yet even today\nneither Canada\u2019s nor Alberta\u2019s income accounts or GDP \u0160gures count natural\ncapital assets that are critical to the well-being of Canadians. \n\nSince the early 1990s the idea of natural capitalism \u2014 that nature\u2019s as-\nsets or capital form one of the key foundations of an economy \u2014 has gained\npopularity in many books, countless articles and conferences. Natural Capi-\ntalism by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins contributed to this\ndebate. Its authors suggested that the world is on the verge of a new industri-\nal revolution founded on the principles of a system called natural capitalism.\nThey argued that traditional capitalism has always neglected to assign mone-\ntary value to its largest stock of capital \u2014 namely, the natural resources and\necosystem services that make possible all economic activity and all life. Nat-\nural capitalism, they stated, takes a proper and full accounting of these costs\nand redesigns industry on biological models that result in zero waste, shifts\nthe economy from the episodic acquisition of goods to the continual \u0161ow of\nvalue and service and prudently invests in sustaining and expanding stores of\nnatural capital. These words were music to my ears.4\n\nEncouraged by pioneering reports\nMoving to Alberta Treasury in 1995, I entered an exciting area: measuring\nthe overall performance of the government and the quality of life of Albertans.\nMeasuring Up5 was one of the \u0160rst triple-bottom-line performance reports in\nwhich a government described the conditions (using 24 core indicators) of\npeople, prosperity and preservation (the 3-Ps of progress). Measuring Up ri-\nvaled pioneer quality of life indicators in Oregon (Oregon Benchmarks),\nMinnesota (Minnesota Milestones) and Seattle (Sustainable Seattle). Alberta\nbecame one of Canada\u2019s (indeed North America\u2019s) models for government ac-\ncountability, business planning and performance outcome measurement by\nreporting to citizens on the outcomes of economic, health, social and environ-\nmental progress. The result expanded conventional economic reporting to in-\nclude such indicators as life expectancy, crime rates, educational attainment,\nthe sustainability of forests, the stock of oil and gas resources and the quality\nof air and water. Working with these new performance measurement and pol-\n\n4 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 4\n\n\n\nicy outcome indicators provided a personal opportunity to see the world in all\nits complexity and begin to understand the true meaning of the word wealth.\n\nWe had begun to diagnose the conditions of well-being \u2014 by de\u0160nition\nthe real wealth of Alberta. I realized that if we could account for nature\u2019s cap-\nital through resource accounts, we could also expand our accounting into the\nunchartered waters of human and social capital accounting. I imagined a new\nway of taking inventory and a new expanded balance sheet for our nation,\nprovince, communities and businesses. If we could measure the conditions of\nwell-being of nature\u2019s capital assets, then we could measure the human and\nsocial conditions of our communities. \n\nIn 1997 a most remarkable study landed in my inbox: the US Genuine\nProgress Indicator (GPI). The GPI was developed by a group of researchers in\n1994, led by Cliff Cobb at the San Francisco-based economic policy think\ntank Rede\u0160ning Progress. The GPI is an alternative measure of economic\nprogress that starts with the GDP and makes adjustments for the value of\nunpaid work (e.g. volunteerism and housework) and for various social and\nenvironmental depreciation costs. While the GDP measures growth by the\namount of money exchanged for goods and services in the economy, the GPI\nattempts to measure well-being according to what most people might de\u0160ne\nas progress. For example, while the GDP currently adds things like the \u0160nan-\ncial costs of auto crashes or the social costs of problem gambling, the GPI\nwould deduct these expenditures as regrettable costs. The GPI represented a\nbaby step towards addressing both Robert Kennedy\u2019s and Marilyn Waring\u2019s\nchallenges that measures of progress should re\u0161ect genuine improvements in\nsocietal well-being. Economists could use GPI accounting to contrast GDP\ngrowth with such regrettable trends as the depletion of nonrenewable oil re-\nserves, the health costs associated with air pollution or the cost of failed per-\nsonal relationships. Most of us would consider such costs as regrettable and\nthus deductible as human, social or natural capital depreciation costs against\nnational income. The US GPI results for the period 1950 to 1995 showed a\nremarkable trend: while the GDP and GPI rose in tandem from 1950 to\n1973, the GPI reached its peak in 1973 and then declined steadily even as the\nGDP continued to rise. The economists\u2019 mantra that a rising tide of the GDP\nlifts all economic boats had been soundly repudiated. \n\nAfter reading the US GPI work I knew that my life as an economist\nwould never be the same and that a lifetime of new research and development\nopportunities lay ahead. The US GPI work inspired me to replicate this\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 5\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 5\n\n\n\nimportant well-being measurement in my home province of Alberta and\nthroughout Canada. I dreamed of creating a Rede\u0160ning Progress Canada and\ndedicating my professional life to developing more meaningful tools for\nmeasuring progress and well-being. Sometimes life sends wonderful surprises.\nIn the spring of 1998 Rede\u0160ning Progress asked to interview me for the posi-\ntion of Sustainability Measurement director in San Francisco to oversee future\nUS GPI work. It seemed the opportunity of a lifetime. My wife Jennifer and I\nwere \u0161own down to San Francisco during the Easter long weekend of 1998.\nWined and dined, I was smitten by the idea of working with such a talented\ngroup of creative researchers and living in San Francisco! During my series of\ninterviews with Rede\u0160ning Progress staff I presented my own vision of a\nmore expansive GPI/well-being measurement system that went beyond full-\ncost accounting of regrettable social and environmental costs included in the\nGDP. My vision was to create a system of well-being accounting that would\nmeasure what mattered most to people: their actual physical and qualitative\nconditions of well-being. I reasoned that behind the monetized GPI estimate\nof progress lay people\u2019s real experiences of living which could be measured\nand used to create both a new index of well-being, but more importantly a\nnew well-being accounting and reporting system.\n\nYet, as compelling as the idea of working with Rede\u0160ning Progress in\nSan Francisco was, my own quality of life assessment (comparing the realities\nof the high cost of living in San Francisco with life in Edmonton close to fam-\nily) revealed that Edmonton held a clear quality of life advantage. After many\nlong discussions with Jennifer and with my own full-cost accounting \u0160gures\nin hand, we concluded that a move to San Francisco would likely lead to a net\nloss in our overall family well-being. In the end, our relationship with our\nfamily and friends was more important than moving to a dream job and a\ndream city. Our decision was an important lesson in both my professional and\npersonal life and was a turning point. It brought my professional interest in\nwell-being measurement down to a practical and personal level. We had\nmade our decision about economic well-being based on a review of our values\nand what we felt mattered most to the well-being of our relationship: our\nchildren and our respective families. We had made a decision to stay home, in\nEdmonton \u2014 the community in which I had grown up and which Jennifer\nnow calls home. Our decision was not based on money, income or material\nquality of life but on intangible, qualitative attributes of life that cannot be\neasily quanti\u0160ed. Neither money, material gains nor career advancement\n\n6 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 6\n\n\n\nmeant as much as being close to family, growing old with my grandparents\nand maintaining life-long friendships in Edmonton, North America\u2019s most\npopulous Northern city. I realize now in retrospect that we had made a choice\nbased on my \u0160rst personal Genuine Wealth assessment.\n\nAfter making this important decision, another door opened. Several\nmonths after the trip to San Francisco when I had returned to consulting work,\nI received a call from the woman who had accepted the position at Rede\u0160ning\nProgress. She said that the Ford Foundation (the key funder of the GPI work)\nwould like to see the GPI updated for 1999. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave the skills to do the work. Would you be interested in performing the\nwork on contract and as a Senior Fellow?\u201d I was stunned. The opportunity of\na lifetime had returned. After contemplating the idea for a few days and dis-\ncussing the opportunity with Jennifer, I decided to leave my high-paid posi-\ntion as a senior policy analyst with Government Policy Consultants (GPC)\nInternational and conduct the US GPI work from my home in Edmonton.\nWorking closely with Cliff Cobb and co-author and journalist Jonathan Rowe,\nI completed the US GPI study update by January 1999. This work was a\ndream come true. It was one of the most important turning points in my career,\nopening up new windows of opportunity to work in this exciting and emerg-\ning \u0160eld of real economics.\n\nCompleting the US GPI work turned out to be one of the most challeng-\ning and arduous economic exercises I had ever undertaken. In Washington\nDC, I had the opportunity to meet some of world\u2019s most progressive econo-\nmists at the World Bank, Resources for the Future, World Resources Institute\nand the University of Maryland to discuss their views of the future of GPI-\nstyle accounting. Most were bullish that the GPI was an important measure-\nment effort that should be sustained, but that the model required more\nrigorous quantitative economic analysis to improve the full cost accounting\nestimates and care that the measure not become too value-biased. My most\nmemorable experience was sitting down with Dr. Herman Daly in his tiny\nUniversity of Maryland of\u0160ce. I consider Daly, one of the founding fathers of\nthe transdisciplinary \u0160eld of ecological economics, to be one of the greatest\nliving economists of our time and deserving of a Nobel Prize for economics. I\nasked Herman a question that would change the course of my economics\ncareer: \u201cIs it possible that our efforts at devising a money-denominated indica-\ntor of economic well-being (the GPI) might be futile since we are attempting\nto monetize quality-of-life issues which have value beyond monetary terms?\u201d\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 7\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 7\n\n\n\nDaly responded to my question with enthusiasm and encouraged me to pur-\nsue the answers with all of my life energy. His challenge has shaped my life in\nways I could not have imagined that afternoon sitting across from this hum-\nble, loving and courageous economist. To understand the importance of the\nnature of money and how it is created, Daly encouraged me to read Michael\nRowbotham\u2019s The Grip of Death (the title inspired by the French word mort-\ngage \u2014 meaning \u201ca pledge unto death\u201d) which was one of the most important\nbooks I read on my long journey to discover the nature of money.6 Daly ex-\nplained that over 90% of the world\u2019s money supply was actually created in the\nform of bank debts, not as paper currency created by governments. I then un-\nderstood that GPI-accounting paled in importance to more fundamental\nchanges required in the nature of money creation and banking. I later came to\nsee that the failure of the sustainability movement to understand and address\nthe nature of our debt-based money system would lead to a dead end street,\nsince genuine sustainability, based on principles of material suf\u0160ciency and\nsubsistence, is anathema to the high priests of our debt-money-economic-\ngrowth system.7\n\nIn January of 1999, my co-author Jonathan Rowe (an economic journal-\nist with Rede\u0160ning Progress) released the 1999 update to the US GPI result-\ning in almost no US media attention. The \u0160rst US GPI estimates by Cliff\nCobb, Jonathan Rowe and Ted Halstead in 1995 had won the attention of the\nAtlantic Monthly with a lead article and magazine cover proclaiming \u201cIf the\nGDP is Up, Why is America Down?\u201d8 Other media also inquired into the re-\nsults at that time. With the 1999 update, it seemed that Americans were\nmore intent on levitating stock market indices than on regrettable news of a\nsustained slide in the US GPI.\n\nBeginning the work in Canada\nIf updating the US GPI had been my economic Mt. Everest, my next goal was\ndeveloping a solid and permanent base camp to advance GPI accounting in\nCanada. I wanted to develop Rede\u0160ning Progress Canada and take the origi-\nnal US GPI work to a new level of sophistication and practical application.\nMy friend and former economics thesis advisor, Dr. Michael Percy now Dean\nof the Faculty of Business at the University of Alberta, gave me the chance to\ncreate and run a research think tank at the University of Alberta to explore al-\nternative accounting and measurement systems. What I had hoped to accom-\nplish in San Francisco I would try to do in Canada. I co-founded the Center for\n\n8 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 8\n\n\n\nPerformance Measurement and Management to conduct applied research on\nalternative measures of economic well-being and performance. For two years I\nserved as the center\u2019s Executive Director and co-taught a course in business\nand the environment with Dr. Ray Rasmussen. During my time with the cen-\nter, my vision for expanding the original GPI accounting system took shape.\nThis was the genesis of the Genuine Wealth system. In the winter of 1999 I\ndeveloped a conceptual grand research agenda for creating a transdisciplinary\nnetwork (well-being.net) of University of Alberta\u2019s top researchers to work on\nthe development of a genuine well-being indicators accounting system. My\nmission was to design a sustainability accounting system for Alberta to assess\nthe long-term sustainability of Alberta\u2019s human, social, natural, produced\n(built) and \u0160nancial capital assets. Unfortunately, it soon became apparent\nfrom discussions with senior members of the University of Alberta that creat-\ning a place for such interdisciplinary research would take years of complex\nnegotiation.\n\nFortunately my vision of advancing GPI-sustainable well-being account-\ning caught the attention of Rob Macintosh, the co-founder of the Pembina\nInstitute for Appropriate Development, one of Canada\u2019s premier environmen-\ntal think tanks. In the fall of 1999, Rob encouraged me to join the Pembina\nteam on a part-time basis. I accepted the opportunity and began splitting my\ntime between the University of Alberta and the Pembina Institute. Rob asked\nme to co-author one of many green budget proposals for the National Round\nTable on the Environment and Economy (NRTEE) which would be present-\ned to then Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin for his Budget 2000.\n\nI proposed that NRTEE create a research Center for Applied Sustainable\nEconomics. The proposed center, with a $10 million three-year budget, would\nhave two main goals: \n\n1. To apply improved or innovative methods for measuring the total wealth\nor well-being of Canadians that leads towards economic, ecological and\nsocial sustainability\n\n2. To revise existing \u0160scal policy instruments to help Canada move towards\na future where quality of life and competitive ef\u0160ciency are shared objec-\ntives in a world of ecological limits\n\nMy proposal also included revising national income accounts and the GDP to\nincorporate natural, human and social capital accounts to compliment exist-\ning economic/\u0160nancial accounts.\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 9\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 9\n\n\n\nThe \u0160nal version of the document proposed developing a set of environ-\nment and sustainable development indicators for Canada that would be re-\nported in parallel with other conventional economic indicators of progress.\nTo my surprise, the Chair of the NRTEE Dr. Stuart Smith fully embraced this\nproposal and brought it forward to Finance Minister Martin, who subse-\nquently announced a three-year, nine million dollar initiative in his spring\nBudget 2000. Martin\u2019s remarks as part of this budget presentation shocked\neven the most seasoned policy analysts when he stated:\n\nFinally, as we move to more fully integrate economic and environ-\nmental policy, we must come to grips with the fact that the current\nmeans of measuring progress are inadequate. Therefore, we are an-\nnouncing today that the National Round Table on the Environment\nand the Economy and Environment Canada, in collaboration with\nStatistics Canada, will be provided funding over the next three years\nto develop a set of indicators to measure environmental performance\nin conjunction with economic performance. In the years ahead, these\nenvironmental indicators could well have a greater impact on public policy\nthan any other single measure we might introduce [my emphasis].9\n\nI knew that a new era in economic reporting in Canada had begun. I spent the\nnext three years traveling to Ottawa as Sustainability Measurement Director\nof the Pembina Institute, developing Canada\u2019s \u0160rst set of environment and\nsustainable development indicators. Our work was completed and released in\nMay 2003. The \u0160nal results were somewhat disappointing: only \u0160ve natural\ncapital indicators (forest cover, freshwater quality, air quality, greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions, extent of wetlands) and one human capital indicator (edu-\ncational attainment) would augment familiar economic data, including the\ngross domestic product (GDP) and the consumer price index (CPI). However,\nthe most important outcome was the recommendation that Statistics Canada\nbegin to explore the options for expanding the System of National Accounts\n(from which the GDP is derived) to include more detailed information on\nnatural, human and social capital. If this recommendation was implemented,\nCanada would be the \u0160rst nation in the world to adopt a total capital account-\ning system that could measure the overall sustainability of the nation. Could\nmy recommendation to Paul Martin for a new balance sheet for the nation to\nmeasure the well-being or Genuine Wealth of Canada become a reality? I\n\n10 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 10\n\n\n\nbegan to feel that the possibility existed, given the good fortune my journey\nwas enjoying on a provincial level.\n\nWhile still working part-time at the University of Alberta in January\n2000, I had proposed to Jason Brisbois, senior economist of the federal gov-\nernment department of Western Economic Diversi\u0160cation (WED), and Brant\nPopp, senior policy analyst at WED, a research project to develop the \u0160rst\nprovincial-scale prototype GPI sustainability accounting and measurement\nsystem for the province of Alberta. Both Jason and Brant were enthused by\nthe idea and suggested I submit a formal proposal. At the same time Rob\nMacintosh encouraged me to do this work through the Pembina Institute. I\ndecided to leave the University of Alberta School of Business and form my\nown Pembina Institute sustainability measurement research team. My re-\nsearch project proposal to WED was accepted in April of 2000, and a team of\n\u0160ve researchers at the Pembina Institute began work on the Genuine Progress\nIndicators Pilot Project \u2014 Alberta Case Study: Accounting for Sustainable Develop-\nment. Our goal was to develop a sustainable well-being accounting and report-\ning system with Alberta as the case study. I began to assemble my Alberta\nGPI research team: Amy Taylor (resource economist), Mary Grif\u0160ths (PhD\nmedical geography and scientist), Sara Wilson (ecological economist), Jeff\nWilson (ecological footprint analyst), with guidance from Barbara Campbell\n(accountant). We began by developing a blue-print for the Alberta GPI\naccounts identifying three key domains: economic/\u0160nancial, social/human\nhealth and environmental. Between April of 2000 and March of 2001 our\nPembina team developed 51 economic, social, health and environmental\nwell-being indicators (GPIs) accounting for Alberta\u2019s progress over four\ndecades from 1961 to 1999. We combed hundreds of statistical databases\n(mostly from Statistics Canada) to construct our well-being ledgers. We\nwanted to answer key questions: Has the overall quality of life of Albertan\u2019s\nimproved over forty years? Are we on a sustainable course for our children?\nWe built on the original US GPI full-cost accounting framework, estimating\nthe full costs of environmental, social and human capital values and deprecia-\ntion costs. We also expanded the US GPI model to what I envisioned as a new\nsustainable well-being accounting system with well-being ledgers that\nwould account for the quantitative (statistical data) and qualitative (opinion\ndata) conditions of well-being. Our 51 indicators, which included the GDP,\nwere based on the Alberta Government\u2019s 24 performance indicators for peo-\nple, prosperity and preservation in Measuring Up, plus other indicators that\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 11\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 11\n\n\n\nwe felt would resonate with quality of life issues important to Albertans.\nThese indicators included time spent with family and friends, volunteer time,\nleisure time, income inequality, personal debt levels, divorce rates, disease\nand suicide rates, problem gambling rates and the ecological footprint (a ro-\nbust measure of the sustainability of our individual lifestyles). Our overall\ngoal was to complete a comprehensive well-being checkup of Alberta, as a\ndoctor would complete an annual health checkup. \n\nAfter many long nights of research, number crunching and analysis we\nreleased the Alberta GPI report on Monday morning, April 23, 2001. Titled\nAlberta Sustainability Trends 2000: The Genuine Progress Indicators Report 1961\nto 1999, our report hit a home run in terms of media coverage. It made the\nfront pages of Canada\u2019s national newspaper, the Globe and Mail, on April 23,\n2001 with the title \u201cFat Cat Albertans Struggle with Happiness\u201d and the\nfront page of the Edmonton Journal with the title \u201cAlberta\u2019s Natural Capital\nSlipping.\u201d I was stunned by the media attention. The phone rang off the hook\nthat day. I was interviewed for CBC television\u2019s nightly newscast The National\nbroadcast on both French and English television channels. Radio interviews\nincluded Alberta-broadcast CHED 630 radio and CBC radio in Montreal and\nWhitehorse. After an exhausting media-frenzied day, I knew that we had\ntapped into a deep current of public consciousness. The average Albertan un-\nderstood that real progress should be measured by more than an increment in\nthe GDP or stock market indices. We had put a quality-of-life-reality-mirror\nup to the GDP using a Genuine Progress Index that revealed that while\nAlberta\u2019s GDP had risen an average 4.4 percent per year over the period 1960\nto 1999, the more comprehensive Genuine Progress Index had declined at an\naverage rate of 0.5 percent during the same period. Indeed, throughout the\n1980s and 1990s the GPI was virtually stagnant as the GDP continued its as-\ncent. The economic credo that a rising tide of the GDP lifts all boats had been\nrepudiated again.\n\nOur results were not unlike the US GPI study. Although Alberta\u2019s Gen-\nuine Progress Index had remained relatively steady throughout the 1980s\nand 1990s, the US GPI had been in steady decline since the mid 1970s. The\nGPI well-being diagnosis also revealed that the average real (de\u0161ated for in-\n\u0161ation) disposable incomes of average Albertans had stagnated since 1981\neven as the GDP continued to rise through to 1999. Most Albertans could re-\nlate to this reality. Other regrettable economic and social trends included ris-\ning rates of suicide, divorce, problem gambling and personal debt. Many of\n\n12 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 12\n\n\n\nthe environmental indicators also showed negative trends including declin-\ning oil and gas reserves, massive fragmentation of forest ecosystem and rising\nlevels of toxic waste production.\n\nOur report sustained media and public attention for several weeks. I was\ninvited to speak at numerous conferences about our \u0160ndings. We had provid-\ned the basis of an important dialogue in Alberta addressing economist Stanley\nK\u00fcznets\u2019 challenge: more growth of what and for whom? Interesting, but not\nsurprising, was the lack of any formal response from the Alberta Government\nand most notably from Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. Klein\u2019s response was\nsimply that we were entitled to our own view of progress \u2014 a compliment\ngiven his penchant for polemic outbursts.

He shares insights gained from various roles in economic policy and consulting, which led him to question traditional measures of progress like GDP and explore more holistic and meaningful metrics.\n\n### Chapter 3: What\u2019s Wrong with the Picture of Progress\n**Key Idea**: Traditional economic indicators such as GDP fail to account for real quality of life and sustainability.\n**Summary**: Anielski critiques traditional measures of progress, particularly GDP, which he argues paints an incomplete picture by ignoring important aspects like environmental degradation and social costs. He introduces alternative metrics like the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), which attempts to provide a more accurate reflection of true progress by accounting for both economic activity and social and environmental health.\n\n### Chapter 4: A Renaissance in Economics and Capitalism\n**Key Idea**: A rethinking of capitalism and economics is necessary to align them more closely with human and ecological well-being.\n**Summary**: This chapter discusses historical and philosophical bases for a transformation in economic thought and practice. Anielski explores how ancient and medieval economic practices, which focused more on moderation and sustainability, can inform modern capitalism. He suggests that a renaissance in economics would involve integrating ethics and recognizing the interdependence of economic activities with social and ecological systems.\n\n### Chapter 5: The Genuine Wealth Model\n**Key Idea**: The Genuine Wealth Model is a holistic approach to measure the well-being of individuals and communities.\n**Summary**: Anielski introduces the Genuine Wealth Model, which assesses the health of five types of capital: human, social, natural, built, and financial. This model is designed to help communities and nations measure and manage their resources for sustainable development, reflecting a broader definition of wealth that includes well-being and happiness.\n\n### Chapter 7: The Genuine Wealth of Communities and Nations\n**Key Idea**: The real wealth of communities and nations lies in their ability to sustain and improve the well-being of their citizens.\n**Summary**: This chapter examines how different communities and nations measure and perceive their wealth. Anielski presents case studies from various places that have implemented the Genuine Wealth Model, showing how it has led to better policy decisions and improved community well-being. He argues for a shift from wealth measured purely in financial terms to one that values social, human, and environmental health equally.\n\nThese summaries offer a glimpse into Anielski&#x27;s comprehensive approach to redefining wealth and economic success through more inclusive and realistic metrics."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "ecb7fa23-e86a-4542-941a-d76709bfd18d", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "880e2335eaee0e9b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ecb7fa23-e86a-4542-941a-d76709bfd18d", "children": ["aaa2c4a2-fe78-47be-9299-f1e10666bb0b"]}, "aaa2c4a2-fe78-47be-9299-f1e10666bb0b": {"id": "aaa2c4a2-fe78-47be-9299-f1e10666bb0b", "message": {"id": "aaa2c4a2-fe78-47be-9299-f1e10666bb0b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715475544.444762, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Hello Casidhe. While studying this week, I noticed that there was no shortage of metrics or projects like the Happy Planet Index measuring or quantifying the effects of social and environmental practices on a national level. In your post, you noted quite a few of them. However, outside of academia, I wondered where this data goes. Are any key stakeholders and decision-makers paying careful attention to this data and allowing it to inform policy? Anielski (2007) suggested that perhaps these more holistic measures were being used to create a better future, but today, things seem worse than ever, and Anielski&#x27;s (2007) analysis seems a bit idealistic as things have gotten worse than ever since then.\u00a0 Given the state of world affairs and the shortfall evident, do you think governments should prioritize more concrete and less idealistic solutions to social and environmental issues?\u00a0\n\nAre the assertions about Anielski in the text above supported  by the text in chapters listed below of  Anielski, M.

That is a world to which all of us can aspire\nand for which we can work, for the sake of our grandchildren\u2019s futures and\ntheirs. Read and lift your expectations; a saner world is possible, and surely\nmost desirable. \n\n\u2014 RAY ANDERSON, Founder and Chairman of Interface, Inc. \n\nMark Anielski does a wonderful job in laying bare the difference between\nmoney and genuine wealth and relating them to our economic growth addic-\ntion. It sounds easy but we all need a lot of training in the use of economic\nconcepts if we are going to be able to find a cure for the monetary madness in\nthis world. \n\n\u2014 OSCAR KJELLBERG, President &amp; CEO, JAK Members Bank, Stockholm\n\nAn inspired and readable inquiry into an \u201coikonomia for the people.\u201d Great\nquestions, with a wealth of perspectives and insightful answers. \n\n\u2014 RAFFI CAVOUKIAN, C.M., singer, author, ecology advocate, \nfounder of Child Honouring \n\nIt is essential that we transform our societies from ones that worship greed\ninto ones that are sustainable, compassionate, and peaceful. The Economics of\nHappiness provides a rationale for beginning this journey immediately and of-\nfers a detailed methodology for measuring our progress along the path. \n\n\u2014 JOHN PERKINS, New York Times bestselling author of Confessions of an \nEconomic Hit Man and The Secret History of the American Empire\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page i\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Happiness will spark an important discussion about one of the\nmajor challenges of our time: how to achieve a balanced, sustainable way of\nlife, where notions of progress and genuine wealth are understood as being\nfundamentally interrelated. To help us on this journey, Mark Anielski points\nto the promise of transformational work in raising our understanding about a\nnew perspective for how we conduct our present and future. \n\n\u2014 HON. ROY ROMANOW, P.C., O.C., Q.C., Former Premier of Saskatchewan,\nChair, Canadian Index of Wellbeing Network Board\n\nIf those who set the goals of society and measure success in reaching them \nbehaved rationally, they would long since have ceased to use per capita Gross\nDomestic Product as the major guide. Until now there has been no full-scale\nstudy demonstrating this and developing a more appropriate alternative.\nWith The Economics of Happiness, the last shred of justification for the exclusive\nfocus on market activity is gone. If this focus is continued, that can only mean\nthat those who profit from our wearing blinders control policy. \n\n\u2014 JOHN B. COBB, JR., theologian and co-author of For the Common Good\n\nWhat is the purpose of our economy and our work if not to support happy\nlives? The Economics of Happiness shows how far we have drifted from that goal\nand details ways to get back on the path to happiness in our personal lives, \nin our businesses and in economic policy.\n\n\u2014 GIFFORD PINCHOT III, Founder and President, \nBainbridge Graduate Institute\n\nReading The Economics of Happiness is a real treat; it is not often that one finds\necomonics, philosophy and ethics brought together so closely. \u201cBeggar the\nnext generation\u201d is no longer acceptable in resource policy. In other words,\nmake room for ethics. That is the message throughout this book.\n\n\u2014 RT. HON. EDWARD R.

In this power-\nful, insightful book, Mark Anielski exposes how this approach actually stunts\nour growth and prevents us from achieving a life that is rich in all senses of\nthe word. Breaking ranks with his fellow economists, Anielski shows how we\ncan make the economy serve the interests of society, not the other way around. \n\n\u2014 LINDA MCQUAIG, author and journalist\n\nMark Anielski\u2019s The Economics of Happiness provides an interesting and inform-\native look at money, economics, wealth and what it all means. The lessons in\nthis book provide a timely guide as our society begins the paradigm shift\naway from crass consumer capitalism toward more sustainable economies and\ncommunities where people and the planet matter. \n\n\u2014 DEAN KUBANi, Environmental Programs Manager \nfor the City of Santa Monica\n\nIn these times, even the best of us are falling short in courageously charting\nnew maps \u2014 and more importantly avoiding heading out without a map at\nall! Mark Anielski is a great pioneer of our time, and The Economics of Happi-\nness is \u201cthe emperor has no clothes\u201d rallying cry our world so desperately\nneeds. This book is a critical part of the architecture of a new system. It is a\nmust read for anyone serious about living differently with each other and the\nplanet. Quite simply \u2014 LOVE is the only true economics, and when we ex-\npress love it does not get used up, it multiplies.  \n\n\u2014 ANITA M. BURKE, Sustainability Elder and former Senior Advisor to the\nCommittee of Managing Directors at Shell International\n\nThe Economics of Happiness helps organizations evolve from satisfying \u201cShow\nme the money!\u201d demands from shareholders to satisfying \u201cShow me the gen-\nuine wealth!\u201d demands from stakeholders. Mark Anielski has provided a\ntimely guidebook for organizations undertaking that challenging journey.\nThis book is a must-read for enlightened business leaders. \n\n\u2014 Bob Willard, author of The Sustainability Advantage and \nThe Next Sustainability Wave\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page iii\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Happiness joins leading voices critical of the dominant econom-\nic paradigm, but it does much more than this. Being a critic is easy enough,\nand so is dreaming dreams. But designing the practical and modelled path to\nconnect the two in different and meaningful strategic alternatives, is the\nwork of exceptional people, and I rank Mark Anielski as one of these.\n\n\u2014 PROFESSOR MARILYN WARING, Institute of Public Policy, \nAuckland University of Technology\n\nMark Anielski is one of those rare Canadians, an economist/civil servant who\ncut loose from the system and became a true public servant. He did so by\nfollowing his values. In so doing he changed his own life, and we are all the\nbeneficiaries. The Economics of Happiness pushes economics back to its more\nhonorable roots and, in so doing, shows us the way towards what is truly a\nnew common wealth. \n\n\u2014 BOB WILLIAMS, Senior Research Fellow, \nVancouver City Savings Credit Union \n\nWe live in a world where money, always a means for something else, has become\na goal in itself. We need, now more than ever, an economic framework that\nhelps us remember what economy is all about: careful use of life sustaining\nresources to ensure love and happiness. Why has no one thought to write such\na book before? \n\n\u2014 KARL-HENRIK ROB\u00c8RT, MD, PhD, \nFounder of  The Natural Step International, \n\nAdjunct Professor of Sustainable Product Developoment, \nBlekinge Institute of Technology\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/26/2007  12:21 PM  Page iv\n\n\n\nNEW SOCIETY PUBLISHERS\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page v\n\n\n\nCataloging in Publication Data:\nA catalog record for this publication is available from the National Library of Canada.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2007 by Mark Anielski.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nCover design by Diane McIntosh.

Peter, an immigrant to\nCanada from Austria in the early 1920s, was a gardener all his life. He under-\nstood what made life worthwhile: the value of time spent with those he loved\nand in the many gardens he nurtured.\n\nTo my parents, Hans-Ulrich and Mary Ann Anielski, who taught me\nhow to dream and act on my dreams with conviction and leadership. They\ntaught me about how to live a life of faith, love, meaningful relationships and\nabout the virtue of meaningful, life-giving work as vocation. \n\nTo my life partner and wife, Jennifer Haslett, who has taught me the joys\nof love and reciprocal relationship; of reconciliation, laughter and most im-\nportantly of open and honest dialogue. And to our two daughters Ren\u00e9e and\nStephanie, who teach me every day about unconditional love and real hap-\npiness. Like my Opa and our elders, my children are teaching me how to\ncelebrate life in the moment of experience and how to breathe love in each\nprecious second of living. Children have a remarkable gift for asking tough\nquestions; this book is dedicated to answering some of those questions which\nstill linger into adulthood.\n\nLike the book of life, this book is the result of years of many wonderful\nconversations and enduring relationships with friends and colleagues around\nthe world. I would like to thank David Korten for encouraging me to write\nthis book and my students at Bainbridge Graduate Institute near Seattle,\nespecially Kate Kaemerle who took the \u0160rst steps with me on this journey by\ncompelling me to \u201cwrite it down, Mark!\u201d To Chris and Judith Plant and\nIngrid Witvoet of New Society Publishers for believing in my message. To\nBetsy Nuse, my wonderful editor whose loving edits have helped shape this\nbook into a crystal of wisdom. To Sue Custance and Diane McIntosh for the\nexquisite cover design that adorns this book, including the idea for a\n\nxiii\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/26/2007  12:21 PM  Page xiii\n\n\n\nFibonnaci sequence which is the golden ratio revealed in nature especially\n\u0161owers. To Jane Haslett, my mother-in-law whose unwavering dedication to\nthe initial edits of this book and her wonderful encouragement continually\nbuoyed my spirit. And to many other friends and colleagues who have in-\nspired and shared in my spiritual and earthly journey including Judi Hoyt,\nRobertFelty,AaronBraaten,AnitaBurke, JoeyHundert,MichaelHaynes,Bill\nHarder, Ernie Zelinski, Orest Andre, Dominic Misho, Boudewijn Wegerif\n(deceased), Jeff Wilson, Kelvin Hirsch, Randy Hirsch, Steve Janzen, Derek\nRasmussen, Pat Klak, Bernard Lietaer, Libba and Gifford Pinchot III, Pat\nCarmack, Mel Hurtig, Oscar Kjellberg, Karl-Heinrik Robert, Leslie Christ-\nian, Bob Willard, Bob Williams, Herman Daly, John Cobb Jr., Ken Chap-\nman, Marilyn Waring, Hazel Henderson, Janine Benyus, Linda McQuaig,\nHarold Wynne, Brian and Mary Nattrass, Michael Percy, Colin Soskolne, Bill\nRees, Dan Rubenstein, Sandra Zagon, Laszlo Pinter, John Rudolph, Edward\nSchreyer, Susan Sharpe, John McMurtry, Rob Smith, Sara Wilson, Rob Taylor,\nHeather Tischbein, Amy Taylor, Rob Macintosh, Peter Haslett, Joy Hecht,\nJohn Helliwell, Robert Putnam and Raf\u0160 Cavoukian. To all the others whom\nI treasure as friends \u2014 for real wealth is measured in terms of enduring rela-\ntionships.\n\nThis book is intended to inspire both current and future builders of the\nnew economy of well-being in the genuine pursuit of happiness and spiritual\nwell-being. I believe our hearts intuit better ways that are in genuine align-\nment with our core values to design, measure and manage our personal, com-\nmunity and world economies. We know that life is more than consumption\nand having more material possessions. We long to build living economies\nfounded on the premise of well-being that are just, sustainable and \u0161ourish-\ning; a society which is guided by the virtues of love, respect, shared responsi-\nbility, forgiveness, stewardship, cooperation, reciprocity, giving and receiving\nand restorative justice. This book is offered to those hearts and minds alive\nwith understanding the wisdom of the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II, Mother\nTheresa and St. Thomas Aquinas who teach us that love is the ultimate source\nof enduring power in the universe. \n\nMy \u0160nal thanks go to God and the Holy Spirit whose loving kindness\ntaught me to get out of the way of my own ego and sense of knowing and to\nrealize that all things come down to a singular breath: LOVE.\n\nxiv The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xiv\n\n\n\nxv\n\nForeword\nby Herman Daly\n\nSUPPOSE THAT GOD sent an auditor to Earth to review the accounts of indi-\nviduals, \u0160rms, municipalities, and nations, with the purpose of assessing\n\ntheir stewardship of Creation and their success in converting resources into\ngood lives lived abundantly, righteously, and joyfully. What accounts or\nledgers would this auditor want to review, and by what criteria would he\njudge their adequacy? In reading this book I could not help thinking of Mark\nAnielski as \u201cGod\u2019s auditor.\u201d I do not want to attribute to Mark any divine au-\nthority or ability (he certainly does not claim such), nor am I sure that the\nAlmighty would not ask for some parts of the report to be redone. Of course\nan omniscient God has no need of an auditor\u2019s report, and the intended audi-\nence and bene\u0160ciary of the audit is us human beings.\n\nThe main criterion guiding the audit is \u201cgenuine well-being\u201d which is\nderived from \u201cgenuine wealth,\u201d which in turn consists of \u0160ve capital accounts\nthat assess both the quantity and quality of each type of capital. These \u0160ve\ncapitals are: (1) human capital \u2014 individual minds, bodies, spirits and their\ncapabilities; (2) social capital \u2014 quality and strength of our relations in com-\nmunity: trust, honesty, common values, including tolerance; (3) natural capi-\ntal \u2014stocks and funds of things in nature that yield \u0161ows of natural resources\nand life-supporting ecosystem services; (4) built capital \u2014machines, tools,\ndurable consumer goods; (5) \u0160nancial capital \u2014 money and other liquid as-\nsets, fungible and acceptable for payment of transactions and debts.\n\nOur current system of national accounts focuses on (5), pays some atten-\ntion to (4), and ignores (1), (2), and (3). The problem is that it is the \u0160rst three\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xv\n\n\n\nthat are most responsible for genuine well-being. While there is some mar-\nginal substitution possible among these different forms of capital (often\noveremphasized by economists who advise not to worry about depleting, say,\nnatural capital as long as you accumulate an \u201cequal amount\u201d of built capital\nor human capital), it is important to recognize, as Anielski does, that the dif-\nferent forms of capital are mainly complementary. A shortage of any one lim-\nits the productivity of the others. In particular \u0160nancial capital quickly be-\ncomes worthless as natural capital is excessively depleted. And a lack of trust\n(social capital) limits the value of knowledge (human capital), etc. The fact\nthat \u0160nancial capital is the most measurable category has biased our attention\ntoo much in its direction. But just how measurable is money really? Do we\nmean M1, M2, or M3, and what kind of measuring rod is it that can be created\nout of nothing and then destroyed, and while it exists can become longer or\nshorter? We must not make a fetish out of measurability. What really counts\nis often not countable. Assets can be recognized and celebrated and main-\ntained and cared for even if we cannot add and subtract them.\n\nAnielski learns from many people: from Luca Pacioli the Italian inventor\nof double-entry bookkeeping, from Karl-Henrik Robert of the Natural Step,\nand Mathis Wackernagel of the Ecological Footprint analysis, and from many\nothers, including even me, which makes this old professor feel good. He looks\nat examples ranging from Ray Anderson\u2019s Interface Carpet Co. with its eco-\nlogical closed loop materials accounting, to China and the idea of xiaokang, or\nthe\u201cmoderatelywelloff society\u201dasanalternativetotheever-growing economy.\nHe studies the Italian province of Emilia Romagna, the Inuit, Bhutan, and\nthe city of Santa Monica. The style ranges from textbook to personal memoir,\nto philosophical re\u0161ection, but all aimed at elucidating and applying the con-\ncept of Genuine Wealth.\n\nSo, gentle reader, I will take up no more of your time with further sum-\nmary and endorsement. After all, you now have the book in your hands, so by\nall means read it carefully. You will be glad you did.\n\n\u2014 Herman E. Daly\n\nHerman E.

Each of us has our own unique journey in discovering these ultimate\n\nends. But what are the determinants of happiness and our conditions of well-\nbeing \u2014 our genuine wealth? What, as Robert Kennedy challenged, makes\nlife worthwhile? How might we measure our happiness and incorporate these\nmeasures into conventional economic measures of progress like the GDP? \n\nPrompted by such nagging questions I began a journey into the origins\nof economic thought and economic systems. I realized that economics is more\nlike a religion than either art or science. The more I probed its tenets, the\nmore the scales of economic dogma fell from my own eyes and the eyes of\nthose with whom I shared my ideas. In a sense our hearts began to open to\ntruths that have long been sti\u0161ed.\n\nWhile some have de\u0160ned economics as the dismal science, I \u0160nd it akin\nto religion precisely because economic principles and tools form the guidance\nsystem of our modern states. Economists are the high priests of our capitalist\nsystems. I count myself among the economic priesthood \u2014 but I am a priest\nwho longs to understand the very premises and value-origins of our thought.\nAs a professor of business and economics, I have found a hunger among my\nstudents to understand more clearly the articles of faith behind business prac-\ntices. Many students question whether pro\u0160t and \u0160nancial wealth maximiza-\ntion should be the primary goals of business; they long for a more meaningful\nworld where corporations are governed by ethics and principles of social and\nenvironmental responsibility. I am buoyed by this new generation of business\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xvii\n\n\n\nand economic graduates who understand at the heart level that the current\n\u201cnew world order\u201d can and must change.\n\nIn economics we have reduced humanity to a collection of individual, in-\ndependent, utility maximizing creatures. Success is de\u0160ned by the accumula-\ntion of material and \u0160nancial wealth over a lifetime. We are born into this free\nmarket ideology without questioning its morality or ethical foundations. So\nwatermarked is this spirit of economics and capitalism on our lives that even\nthough our hearts cry out for a more meaningful and genuine existence, we\nare sucked back into the squirrel cage of capitalism, running faster and faster\nto \u201ckeep up with the Jones,\u201d lamenting as we imagine a simpler, more mean-\ningful, more genuine life. \n\nI \u0160rmly believe we are at an important tipping point in human history. A\nshared consciousness is emerging which will be supported by enlightened,\nlife-af\u0160rming economics. This book presents my future vision: stewardship of\nwhat I call Genuine Wealth \u2014 those conditions of well-being that align with\nour heartfelt values about what makes life worth living. \n\nThe Economics of Happiness has four primary goals.First, I explore the nature\nand spirit of the current economic system. I want to better understand why\nmany in the sustainability movement can\u2019t seem to move towards a genuine,\nliving and sustainable economic system. I wonder how Adam Smith\u2019s seminal\neconomics text,TheWealth of Nations, failed toconsider theOldEnglishorigins\nof theword\u201cwealth,\u201dwhichliterallymeans\u201ctheconditionsofwell-being.\u201d The\nimportant work of Amitore Fanfani traced economic and capitalistic think-\ning back to the European Middle Ages where Fanfani located a pre-capitalist\nmodel that the sustainability movement may \u0160nd desirable.\n\nMy second goal is to introduce the concept of Genuine Wealth: a new\nand compelling model for managing our personal, household, business and\ncommunity well-being in accordance with the values that de\u0160ne our quality\nof life. Genuine Wealth is a practical system which measures and manages for\nsustainability the total capital assets of a community or organization. Syn-\nthesizing emerging concepts like natural capital and social capital, Genuine\nWealth creates a more comprehensive accounting system where human, so-\ncial, natural, built and \u0160nancial capital are all integrated into the balance sheet.\nThis vision of a living, sustainable economy is founded on the mutually rein-\nforcing and integrated principles of ef\u0160ciency, equity and reciprocity and was\ninspired by the cooperative economy of Emilia Romagna, a \u0161ourishing and\nvibrant region of Italy.\n\nxviii The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xviii\n\n\n\nThirdly I provide examples of applications of the Genuine Wealth model\nat the personal/household, corporate/business, community, state/provincial\nand national scales. I present stories from Nunavut in Canada\u2019s Arctic, the City\nof Santa Monica, California and Leduc, Alberta and explore systems like the US\nGenuine Progress Indicators (GPI) and the Alberta GPI Sustainable Well-\nbeing Accounting System.\n\nFourthly I examine the nature of money and the current debt-based\nbanking system. Mountains of unsustainable debt and the practice of charg-\ning interest on loans actually lead to the destruction of living capital and\nfundamentally undermine sustainable economies of well-being and happi-\nness. I offer examples of alternatives to the current banking systems like the\nJAK Members Bank in Sweden, a cooperative member-owned bank that does\nnot charge interest on loans. I present a Genuine Wealth money and banking\nmodel that returns the power of money creation to the people in community.\nMoney could be created to serve the genuine needs of an economy of happi-\nness, and private banks, by providing wise \u0160nancial counsel to households\nand businesses, could contribute directly to the development of genuine\neconomies of well-being.\n\nWhile there is a growing library of books about sustainability, I offer\nhere a new paradigm which is also a pragmatic system for the management\nand stewardship of the common wealth of nations. While other books might\ndespair at the sad state of the world and our environment, The Economics of\nHappiness holds out hope that a genuine renaissance in economics, accounting\nand business practices is possible and that you and I can build communities of\ngenuine well-being and happiness, a vision that is shared by many. This book\nis optimistic and predicated on faith that people of all nations understand in-\ntuitively what needs to change in order for humanity to move towards a more\nsustainable future.\n\n\u2014 Mark Anielski\n\nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada\n\nIntroduction xix\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xix\n\n\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xx\n\n\n\n1\n\nChapter 1\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth\n\nMany people have asked me \u201chow did you get to where you are?\u201d\nMy professional background includes economics, forestry, accounting\n\nand religious studies. After three university degrees and years working as a\nprofessional economist, I have developed an overview of the ways economic\nsystems operate throughout the world. In my inquiry into economic systems\nI continue to ask the simple question \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Why do economists, \u0160nancial analysts, politicians and media \u0160xate on\ngrowth measures (such as the GDP or gross domestic product) as the key\nindicator of human progress? \n\n\u2022 Why do economy and stock market indices have to keep growing if a com-\nmunity has achieved levels of material self-suf\u0160ciency and quality of life?\n\n\u2022 What is money and where does it come from? \n\u2022 Why is money always scarce? \n\u2022 What\u2019s wrong with a steady-state, subsistence economy which has\n\nachieved suf\u0160ciency and homeostasis? \n\u2022 Why does free-market, capitalist economics look more like a cancer cell\n\nthan the self-renewing life cycle of an ancient forest? \n\u2022 What is driving our more-growth, more-consumption obsession? \n\u2022 Why aren\u2019t economists and our leaders asking hard questions: more\n\ngrowth of what? for whom? \n\nThese are just some of the questions I began to ask myself as an economist\nworking in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a senior government\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 1\n\n\n\neconomic policy analyst at Alberta Environment my primary task was to de-\nrive monetary value for Alberta\u2019s natural capital assets or natural resources;\nmany of them, like wilderness, had no price in a market. I was puzzled that\nwe had to reduce the value of everything to a monetary \u0160gure so it could\ncount. If something had no monetary value \u2014 like the joy of a wilderness ex-\nperience or the sight of a grizzly bear \u2014 did this mean that it was worthless?\nI began questioning the meaning of the word value. I was learning that there\nmight be market and non-market values. Economist and author Marilyn\nWaring offered my \u0160rst plain language lesson in the art of national income ac-\ncounting and the shortcomings of the gross domestic product (GDP) as a\nmeasure of progress.1 Marilyn noted that if you want fantastic GDP growth\nyou would deliberately crash an oil tanker like the Exxon Valdez into an\nAlaskan reef rather than deliver its cargo of oil safely to a Seattle port. Mari-\nlyn was the \u0160rst economist to point out to me the origins of the word value\n(from the Latin valere meaning \u201cshowing worth\u201d). Her warnings about the\nshortcoming of the GNP (the gross national product, the GDP\u2019s cousin) as a\nmeasure of progress had been voiced by Robert Kennedy in 1968 just a few\nweeks before his untimely assassination. Kennedy lamented that while the\nGNP might be great at adding up all the money we spend on goods and serv-\nices in an economy, it was a lousy measure of what mattered most to Ameri-\ncans: their quality of life. No other politician has given such a poignant cri-\ntique of the world\u2019s key measure of progress.2 For me, Kennedy\u2019s rebuke was\na clarion call to research and develop better systems of measuring human\nprogress and well-being that make common sense to average citizens and\nalign with their values.\n\nLearning about natural capital and sustainability\nWith these insights, I began to examine new models for measuring progress,\nsustainability and well-being. I began to explore new methods for accounting\nor measuring sustainability, \u0160rst focused on natural capital and then expand-\ning into other forms of capital accounting including human capital (like\ntime, knowledge and health) and social capital3 (like trust and the strength of\nrelationships). In 1991 I discovered the pioneering work of Robert Repetto at\nthe World Resources Institute in Washington. Repetto argued that account-\nants should treat nature\u2019s capital in the same way they treat manufactured or\nproduced capital like buildings, equipment and computers. Accounting\nshould acknowledge that nature\u2019s capital \u2014 like forests, oil and agricultural\n\n2 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 2\n\n\n\nsoils \u2014 can either depreciate (that is, be depleted or degraded) or appreciate\n(that is, grow in volume or quality). Repetto\u2019s primary argument made good\nsense. I began to ask \u201cwhy don\u2019t we keep a balance sheet for nature\u2019s capital\nassets like forests, oil, gas, coal, wildlife, water and soils that are so vital to\nAlberta\u2019s and Canada\u2019s economy?\u201d I reasoned that economists ignored the\nvalue of nature\u2019s capital either because it was too hard to measure or count or\nbecause it was politically expedient.\n\nWith my curiosity piqued, I began informally examining Alberta\u2019s nat-\nural assets beginning with forests, oil/natural gas and carbon. Were Alberta\u2019s\nforests being managed sustainably? How many years of oil and natural gas\nsupply did Alberta have left? My preliminary results suggested that Alberta\u2019s\nforests might be approaching an unsustainability threshold: more trees were\nbeing harvested and destroyed by \u0160re and insects than the reported annual\ngrowth of the total forest. More disconcertingly, I lacked con\u0160dence in the an-\nnual growth rate of the forest. That was akin to lacking con\u0160dence in the rev-\nenue line on a conventional income statement or the interest rate on my bank\naccount! When I looked at oil and gas natural capital accounts, I was shocked\nto discover that the reserve life or years of future production of conventional\noil and natural gas left, at current production rates, was shrinking rapidly.\nBy my calculations Alberta would exhaust its precious oil and gas reserves\nwithin 12 years without new discoveries. Without information which natural\ncapital accounting provides to guide economic policy decisions, how could\nAlberta decision makers insure the long-term sustainability of Alberta\u2019s nat-\nural capital assets? How could there be so little interest shown in natural cap-\nital accounting practices by a government committed to accountability and\nperformance measurement? \n\nIn constructing these early natural capital accounts I learned an impor-\ntant lesson. While we had mountains of data and information, we seemed to\nlack the wisdom or capacity to understand what all the information was\ntelling us about sustainability. We had lost sight of the forest, so focused were\nwe on making money on the harvesting and export of trees. I realized that\nthere was an important role for accountants and economists to play in devel-\noping new capital accounting tools to assess the long-term sustainability of\nnature\u2019s capital assets as well as human and social capital. Economists could\nbegin developing revised national income accounts and adjusted GDP \u0160gures\nthat counted natural, human and social capital depreciation. I knew that such\naccounts could be constructed from the data we currently collected on the\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 3\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 3\n\n\n\nphysical state of our forests and other natural capital. Yet I knew that, like all\nmajor changes, a move to incorporate natural capital into the balance sheet of\nthe nation would be faced with resistance and reluctance to change. Fortu-\nnately almost 15 years later, the term natural capital has been popularized by\nothers (including by the Canada West Foundation in Calgary). Yet even today\nneither Canada\u2019s nor Alberta\u2019s income accounts or GDP \u0160gures count natural\ncapital assets that are critical to the well-being of Canadians. \n\nSince the early 1990s the idea of natural capitalism \u2014 that nature\u2019s as-\nsets or capital form one of the key foundations of an economy \u2014 has gained\npopularity in many books, countless articles and conferences. Natural Capi-\ntalism by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins contributed to this\ndebate. Its authors suggested that the world is on the verge of a new industri-\nal revolution founded on the principles of a system called natural capitalism.\nThey argued that traditional capitalism has always neglected to assign mone-\ntary value to its largest stock of capital \u2014 namely, the natural resources and\necosystem services that make possible all economic activity and all life. Nat-\nural capitalism, they stated, takes a proper and full accounting of these costs\nand redesigns industry on biological models that result in zero waste, shifts\nthe economy from the episodic acquisition of goods to the continual \u0161ow of\nvalue and service and prudently invests in sustaining and expanding stores of\nnatural capital. These words were music to my ears.4\n\nEncouraged by pioneering reports\nMoving to Alberta Treasury in 1995, I entered an exciting area: measuring\nthe overall performance of the government and the quality of life of Albertans.\nMeasuring Up5 was one of the \u0160rst triple-bottom-line performance reports in\nwhich a government described the conditions (using 24 core indicators) of\npeople, prosperity and preservation (the 3-Ps of progress). Measuring Up ri-\nvaled pioneer quality of life indicators in Oregon (Oregon Benchmarks),\nMinnesota (Minnesota Milestones) and Seattle (Sustainable Seattle). Alberta\nbecame one of Canada\u2019s (indeed North America\u2019s) models for government ac-\ncountability, business planning and performance outcome measurement by\nreporting to citizens on the outcomes of economic, health, social and environ-\nmental progress. The result expanded conventional economic reporting to in-\nclude such indicators as life expectancy, crime rates, educational attainment,\nthe sustainability of forests, the stock of oil and gas resources and the quality\nof air and water. Working with these new performance measurement and pol-\n\n4 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 4\n\n\n\nicy outcome indicators provided a personal opportunity to see the world in all\nits complexity and begin to understand the true meaning of the word wealth.\n\nWe had begun to diagnose the conditions of well-being \u2014 by de\u0160nition\nthe real wealth of Alberta. I realized that if we could account for nature\u2019s cap-\nital through resource accounts, we could also expand our accounting into the\nunchartered waters of human and social capital accounting. I imagined a new\nway of taking inventory and a new expanded balance sheet for our nation,\nprovince, communities and businesses. If we could measure the conditions of\nwell-being of nature\u2019s capital assets, then we could measure the human and\nsocial conditions of our communities. \n\nIn 1997 a most remarkable study landed in my inbox: the US Genuine\nProgress Indicator (GPI). The GPI was developed by a group of researchers in\n1994, led by Cliff Cobb at the San Francisco-based economic policy think\ntank Rede\u0160ning Progress. The GPI is an alternative measure of economic\nprogress that starts with the GDP and makes adjustments for the value of\nunpaid work (e.g. volunteerism and housework) and for various social and\nenvironmental depreciation costs. While the GDP measures growth by the\namount of money exchanged for goods and services in the economy, the GPI\nattempts to measure well-being according to what most people might de\u0160ne\nas progress. For example, while the GDP currently adds things like the \u0160nan-\ncial costs of auto crashes or the social costs of problem gambling, the GPI\nwould deduct these expenditures as regrettable costs. The GPI represented a\nbaby step towards addressing both Robert Kennedy\u2019s and Marilyn Waring\u2019s\nchallenges that measures of progress should re\u0161ect genuine improvements in\nsocietal well-being. Economists could use GPI accounting to contrast GDP\ngrowth with such regrettable trends as the depletion of nonrenewable oil re-\nserves, the health costs associated with air pollution or the cost of failed per-\nsonal relationships. Most of us would consider such costs as regrettable and\nthus deductible as human, social or natural capital depreciation costs against\nnational income. The US GPI results for the period 1950 to 1995 showed a\nremarkable trend: while the GDP and GPI rose in tandem from 1950 to\n1973, the GPI reached its peak in 1973 and then declined steadily even as the\nGDP continued to rise. The economists\u2019 mantra that a rising tide of the GDP\nlifts all economic boats had been soundly repudiated. \n\nAfter reading the US GPI work I knew that my life as an economist\nwould never be the same and that a lifetime of new research and development\nopportunities lay ahead. The US GPI work inspired me to replicate this\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 5\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 5\n\n\n\nimportant well-being measurement in my home province of Alberta and\nthroughout Canada. I dreamed of creating a Rede\u0160ning Progress Canada and\ndedicating my professional life to developing more meaningful tools for\nmeasuring progress and well-being. Sometimes life sends wonderful surprises.\nIn the spring of 1998 Rede\u0160ning Progress asked to interview me for the posi-\ntion of Sustainability Measurement director in San Francisco to oversee future\nUS GPI work. It seemed the opportunity of a lifetime. My wife Jennifer and I\nwere \u0161own down to San Francisco during the Easter long weekend of 1998.\nWined and dined, I was smitten by the idea of working with such a talented\ngroup of creative researchers and living in San Francisco! During my series of\ninterviews with Rede\u0160ning Progress staff I presented my own vision of a\nmore expansive GPI/well-being measurement system that went beyond full-\ncost accounting of regrettable social and environmental costs included in the\nGDP. My vision was to create a system of well-being accounting that would\nmeasure what mattered most to people: their actual physical and qualitative\nconditions of well-being. I reasoned that behind the monetized GPI estimate\nof progress lay people\u2019s real experiences of living which could be measured\nand used to create both a new index of well-being, but more importantly a\nnew well-being accounting and reporting system.\n\nYet, as compelling as the idea of working with Rede\u0160ning Progress in\nSan Francisco was, my own quality of life assessment (comparing the realities\nof the high cost of living in San Francisco with life in Edmonton close to fam-\nily) revealed that Edmonton held a clear quality of life advantage. After many\nlong discussions with Jennifer and with my own full-cost accounting \u0160gures\nin hand, we concluded that a move to San Francisco would likely lead to a net\nloss in our overall family well-being. In the end, our relationship with our\nfamily and friends was more important than moving to a dream job and a\ndream city. Our decision was an important lesson in both my professional and\npersonal life and was a turning point. It brought my professional interest in\nwell-being measurement down to a practical and personal level. We had\nmade our decision about economic well-being based on a review of our values\nand what we felt mattered most to the well-being of our relationship: our\nchildren and our respective families. We had made a decision to stay home, in\nEdmonton \u2014 the community in which I had grown up and which Jennifer\nnow calls home. Our decision was not based on money, income or material\nquality of life but on intangible, qualitative attributes of life that cannot be\neasily quanti\u0160ed. Neither money, material gains nor career advancement\n\n6 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 6\n\n\n\nmeant as much as being close to family, growing old with my grandparents\nand maintaining life-long friendships in Edmonton, North America\u2019s most\npopulous Northern city. I realize now in retrospect that we had made a choice\nbased on my \u0160rst personal Genuine Wealth assessment.\n\nAfter making this important decision, another door opened. Several\nmonths after the trip to San Francisco when I had returned to consulting work,\nI received a call from the woman who had accepted the position at Rede\u0160ning\nProgress. She said that the Ford Foundation (the key funder of the GPI work)\nwould like to see the GPI updated for 1999. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave the skills to do the work. Would you be interested in performing the\nwork on contract and as a Senior Fellow?\u201d I was stunned. The opportunity of\na lifetime had returned. After contemplating the idea for a few days and dis-\ncussing the opportunity with Jennifer, I decided to leave my high-paid posi-\ntion as a senior policy analyst with Government Policy Consultants (GPC)\nInternational and conduct the US GPI work from my home in Edmonton.\nWorking closely with Cliff Cobb and co-author and journalist Jonathan Rowe,\nI completed the US GPI study update by January 1999. This work was a\ndream come true. It was one of the most important turning points in my career,\nopening up new windows of opportunity to work in this exciting and emerg-\ning \u0160eld of real economics.\n\nCompleting the US GPI work turned out to be one of the most challeng-\ning and arduous economic exercises I had ever undertaken. In Washington\nDC, I had the opportunity to meet some of world\u2019s most progressive econo-\nmists at the World Bank, Resources for the Future, World Resources Institute\nand the University of Maryland to discuss their views of the future of GPI-\nstyle accounting. Most were bullish that the GPI was an important measure-\nment effort that should be sustained, but that the model required more\nrigorous quantitative economic analysis to improve the full cost accounting\nestimates and care that the measure not become too value-biased. My most\nmemorable experience was sitting down with Dr. Herman Daly in his tiny\nUniversity of Maryland of\u0160ce. I consider Daly, one of the founding fathers of\nthe transdisciplinary \u0160eld of ecological economics, to be one of the greatest\nliving economists of our time and deserving of a Nobel Prize for economics. I\nasked Herman a question that would change the course of my economics\ncareer: \u201cIs it possible that our efforts at devising a money-denominated indica-\ntor of economic well-being (the GPI) might be futile since we are attempting\nto monetize quality-of-life issues which have value beyond monetary terms?\u201d\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 7\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 7\n\n\n\nDaly responded to my question with enthusiasm and encouraged me to pur-\nsue the answers with all of my life energy. His challenge has shaped my life in\nways I could not have imagined that afternoon sitting across from this hum-\nble, loving and courageous economist. To understand the importance of the\nnature of money and how it is created, Daly encouraged me to read Michael\nRowbotham\u2019s The Grip of Death (the title inspired by the French word mort-\ngage \u2014 meaning \u201ca pledge unto death\u201d) which was one of the most important\nbooks I read on my long journey to discover the nature of money.6 Daly ex-\nplained that over 90% of the world\u2019s money supply was actually created in the\nform of bank debts, not as paper currency created by governments. I then un-\nderstood that GPI-accounting paled in importance to more fundamental\nchanges required in the nature of money creation and banking. I later came to\nsee that the failure of the sustainability movement to understand and address\nthe nature of our debt-based money system would lead to a dead end street,\nsince genuine sustainability, based on principles of material suf\u0160ciency and\nsubsistence, is anathema to the high priests of our debt-money-economic-\ngrowth system.7\n\nIn January of 1999, my co-author Jonathan Rowe (an economic journal-\nist with Rede\u0160ning Progress) released the 1999 update to the US GPI result-\ning in almost no US media attention. The \u0160rst US GPI estimates by Cliff\nCobb, Jonathan Rowe and Ted Halstead in 1995 had won the attention of the\nAtlantic Monthly with a lead article and magazine cover proclaiming \u201cIf the\nGDP is Up, Why is America Down?\u201d8 Other media also inquired into the re-\nsults at that time. With the 1999 update, it seemed that Americans were\nmore intent on levitating stock market indices than on regrettable news of a\nsustained slide in the US GPI.\n\nBeginning the work in Canada\nIf updating the US GPI had been my economic Mt. Everest, my next goal was\ndeveloping a solid and permanent base camp to advance GPI accounting in\nCanada. I wanted to develop Rede\u0160ning Progress Canada and take the origi-\nnal US GPI work to a new level of sophistication and practical application.\nMy friend and former economics thesis advisor, Dr. Michael Percy now Dean\nof the Faculty of Business at the University of Alberta, gave me the chance to\ncreate and run a research think tank at the University of Alberta to explore al-\nternative accounting and measurement systems. What I had hoped to accom-\nplish in San Francisco I would try to do in Canada. I co-founded the Center for\n\n8 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 8\n\n\n\nPerformance Measurement and Management to conduct applied research on\nalternative measures of economic well-being and performance. For two years I\nserved as the center\u2019s Executive Director and co-taught a course in business\nand the environment with Dr. Ray Rasmussen. During my time with the cen-\nter, my vision for expanding the original GPI accounting system took shape.\nThis was the genesis of the Genuine Wealth system. In the winter of 1999 I\ndeveloped a conceptual grand research agenda for creating a transdisciplinary\nnetwork (well-being.net) of University of Alberta\u2019s top researchers to work on\nthe development of a genuine well-being indicators accounting system. My\nmission was to design a sustainability accounting system for Alberta to assess\nthe long-term sustainability of Alberta\u2019s human, social, natural, produced\n(built) and \u0160nancial capital assets. Unfortunately, it soon became apparent\nfrom discussions with senior members of the University of Alberta that creat-\ning a place for such interdisciplinary research would take years of complex\nnegotiation.\n\nFortunately my vision of advancing GPI-sustainable well-being account-\ning caught the attention of Rob Macintosh, the co-founder of the Pembina\nInstitute for Appropriate Development, one of Canada\u2019s premier environmen-\ntal think tanks. In the fall of 1999, Rob encouraged me to join the Pembina\nteam on a part-time basis. I accepted the opportunity and began splitting my\ntime between the University of Alberta and the Pembina Institute. Rob asked\nme to co-author one of many green budget proposals for the National Round\nTable on the Environment and Economy (NRTEE) which would be present-\ned to then Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin for his Budget 2000.\n\nI proposed that NRTEE create a research Center for Applied Sustainable\nEconomics. The proposed center, with a $10 million three-year budget, would\nhave two main goals: \n\n1. To apply improved or innovative methods for measuring the total wealth\nor well-being of Canadians that leads towards economic, ecological and\nsocial sustainability\n\n2. To revise existing \u0160scal policy instruments to help Canada move towards\na future where quality of life and competitive ef\u0160ciency are shared objec-\ntives in a world of ecological limits\n\nMy proposal also included revising national income accounts and the GDP to\nincorporate natural, human and social capital accounts to compliment exist-\ning economic/\u0160nancial accounts.\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 9\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 9\n\n\n\nThe \u0160nal version of the document proposed developing a set of environ-\nment and sustainable development indicators for Canada that would be re-\nported in parallel with other conventional economic indicators of progress.\nTo my surprise, the Chair of the NRTEE Dr. Stuart Smith fully embraced this\nproposal and brought it forward to Finance Minister Martin, who subse-\nquently announced a three-year, nine million dollar initiative in his spring\nBudget 2000. Martin\u2019s remarks as part of this budget presentation shocked\neven the most seasoned policy analysts when he stated:\n\nFinally, as we move to more fully integrate economic and environ-\nmental policy, we must come to grips with the fact that the current\nmeans of measuring progress are inadequate. Therefore, we are an-\nnouncing today that the National Round Table on the Environment\nand the Economy and Environment Canada, in collaboration with\nStatistics Canada, will be provided funding over the next three years\nto develop a set of indicators to measure environmental performance\nin conjunction with economic performance. In the years ahead, these\nenvironmental indicators could well have a greater impact on public policy\nthan any other single measure we might introduce [my emphasis].9\n\nI knew that a new era in economic reporting in Canada had begun. I spent the\nnext three years traveling to Ottawa as Sustainability Measurement Director\nof the Pembina Institute, developing Canada\u2019s \u0160rst set of environment and\nsustainable development indicators. Our work was completed and released in\nMay 2003. The \u0160nal results were somewhat disappointing: only \u0160ve natural\ncapital indicators (forest cover, freshwater quality, air quality, greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions, extent of wetlands) and one human capital indicator (edu-\ncational attainment) would augment familiar economic data, including the\ngross domestic product (GDP) and the consumer price index (CPI). However,\nthe most important outcome was the recommendation that Statistics Canada\nbegin to explore the options for expanding the System of National Accounts\n(from which the GDP is derived) to include more detailed information on\nnatural, human and social capital. If this recommendation was implemented,\nCanada would be the \u0160rst nation in the world to adopt a total capital account-\ning system that could measure the overall sustainability of the nation. Could\nmy recommendation to Paul Martin for a new balance sheet for the nation to\nmeasure the well-being or Genuine Wealth of Canada become a reality? I\n\n10 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 10\n\n\n\nbegan to feel that the possibility existed, given the good fortune my journey\nwas enjoying on a provincial level.\n\nWhile still working part-time at the University of Alberta in January\n2000, I had proposed to Jason Brisbois, senior economist of the federal gov-\nernment department of Western Economic Diversi\u0160cation (WED), and Brant\nPopp, senior policy analyst at WED, a research project to develop the \u0160rst\nprovincial-scale prototype GPI sustainability accounting and measurement\nsystem for the province of Alberta. Both Jason and Brant were enthused by\nthe idea and suggested I submit a formal proposal. At the same time Rob\nMacintosh encouraged me to do this work through the Pembina Institute. I\ndecided to leave the University of Alberta School of Business and form my\nown Pembina Institute sustainability measurement research team. My re-\nsearch project proposal to WED was accepted in April of 2000, and a team of\n\u0160ve researchers at the Pembina Institute began work on the Genuine Progress\nIndicators Pilot Project \u2014 Alberta Case Study: Accounting for Sustainable Develop-\nment. Our goal was to develop a sustainable well-being accounting and report-\ning system with Alberta as the case study. I began to assemble my Alberta\nGPI research team: Amy Taylor (resource economist), Mary Grif\u0160ths (PhD\nmedical geography and scientist), Sara Wilson (ecological economist), Jeff\nWilson (ecological footprint analyst), with guidance from Barbara Campbell\n(accountant). We began by developing a blue-print for the Alberta GPI\naccounts identifying three key domains: economic/\u0160nancial, social/human\nhealth and environmental. Between April of 2000 and March of 2001 our\nPembina team developed 51 economic, social, health and environmental\nwell-being indicators (GPIs) accounting for Alberta\u2019s progress over four\ndecades from 1961 to 1999. We combed hundreds of statistical databases\n(mostly from Statistics Canada) to construct our well-being ledgers. We\nwanted to answer key questions: Has the overall quality of life of Albertan\u2019s\nimproved over forty years? Are we on a sustainable course for our children?\nWe built on the original US GPI full-cost accounting framework, estimating\nthe full costs of environmental, social and human capital values and deprecia-\ntion costs. We also expanded the US GPI model to what I envisioned as a new\nsustainable well-being accounting system with well-being ledgers that\nwould account for the quantitative (statistical data) and qualitative (opinion\ndata) conditions of well-being. Our 51 indicators, which included the GDP,\nwere based on the Alberta Government\u2019s 24 performance indicators for peo-\nple, prosperity and preservation in Measuring Up, plus other indicators that\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 11\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 11\n\n\n\nwe felt would resonate with quality of life issues important to Albertans.\nThese indicators included time spent with family and friends, volunteer time,\nleisure time, income inequality, personal debt levels, divorce rates, disease\nand suicide rates, problem gambling rates and the ecological footprint (a ro-\nbust measure of the sustainability of our individual lifestyles). Our overall\ngoal was to complete a comprehensive well-being checkup of Alberta, as a\ndoctor would complete an annual health checkup. \n\nAfter many long nights of research, number crunching and analysis we\nreleased the Alberta GPI report on Monday morning, April 23, 2001. Titled\nAlberta Sustainability Trends 2000: The Genuine Progress Indicators Report 1961\nto 1999, our report hit a home run in terms of media coverage. It made the\nfront pages of Canada\u2019s national newspaper, the Globe and Mail, on April 23,\n2001 with the title \u201cFat Cat Albertans Struggle with Happiness\u201d and the\nfront page of the Edmonton Journal with the title \u201cAlberta\u2019s Natural Capital\nSlipping.\u201d I was stunned by the media attention. The phone rang off the hook\nthat day. I was interviewed for CBC television\u2019s nightly newscast The National\nbroadcast on both French and English television channels. Radio interviews\nincluded Alberta-broadcast CHED 630 radio and CBC radio in Montreal and\nWhitehorse. After an exhausting media-frenzied day, I knew that we had\ntapped into a deep current of public consciousness. The average Albertan un-\nderstood that real progress should be measured by more than an increment in\nthe GDP or stock market indices. We had put a quality-of-life-reality-mirror\nup to the GDP using a Genuine Progress Index that revealed that while\nAlberta\u2019s GDP had risen an average 4.4 percent per year over the period 1960\nto 1999, the more comprehensive Genuine Progress Index had declined at an\naverage rate of 0.5 percent during the same period. Indeed, throughout the\n1980s and 1990s the GPI was virtually stagnant as the GDP continued its as-\ncent. The economic credo that a rising tide of the GDP lifts all boats had been\nrepudiated again.\n\nOur results were not unlike the US GPI study. Although Alberta\u2019s Gen-\nuine Progress Index had remained relatively steady throughout the 1980s\nand 1990s, the US GPI had been in steady decline since the mid 1970s. The\nGPI well-being diagnosis also revealed that the average real (de\u0161ated for in-\n\u0161ation) disposable incomes of average Albertans had stagnated since 1981\neven as the GDP continued to rise through to 1999. Most Albertans could re-\nlate to this reality. Other regrettable economic and social trends included ris-\ning rates of suicide, divorce, problem gambling and personal debt. Many of\n\n12 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 12\n\n\n\nthe environmental indicators also showed negative trends including declin-\ning oil and gas reserves, massive fragmentation of forest ecosystem and rising\nlevels of toxic waste production.\n\nOur report sustained media and public attention for several weeks. I was\ninvited to speak at numerous conferences about our \u0160ndings. We had provid-\ned the basis of an important dialogue in Alberta addressing economist Stanley\nK\u00fcznets\u2019 challenge: more growth of what and for whom? Interesting, but not\nsurprising, was the lack of any formal response from the Alberta Government\nand most notably from Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. Klein\u2019s response was\nsimply that we were entitled to our own view of progress \u2014 a compliment\ngiven his penchant for polemic outbursts.

Here&#x27;s how:\n\n1. **Chapter 1: My Journey to Genuine Wealth** - Anielski shares his personal and professional journey towards understanding and measuring wealth beyond traditional economic metrics. He explores the inception of the Genuine Wealth Model, indicating his early recognition of the limitations of conventional economic indicators like GDP. This supports his view of shifting towards more holistic measures that may better predict and influence a sustainable future.\n\n2. **Chapter 3: What\u2019s Wrong with the Picture of Progress** - This chapter critiques the adequacy of GDP as a measure of societal progress and discusses the development of alternative measures like the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). This supports Anielski&#x27;s perspective that traditional measures are insufficient for capturing true societal well-being and suggests a need for metrics that better reflect social and environmental health.\n\n3. **Chapter 4: A Renaissance in Economics and Capitalism** - Anielski argues for a significant transformation in the way economies operate and are measured, drawing on historical and philosophical bases for a systemic change. This reflects his view on the necessity of redefining economic success to align more closely with ecological sustainability and human well-being.\n\n4. **Chapter 5: The Genuine Wealth Model** - This chapter outlines the Genuine Wealth Model in detail, a comprehensive approach for measuring the well-being of communities through various forms of capital including natural, social, and human capital. This model embodies Anielski&#x27;s idealistic vision of integrating more meaningful metrics into economic evaluations and policy-making.\n\n5. **Chapter 7: The Genuine Wealth of Communities and Nations** - The practical application of the Genuine Wealth Model in various communities and its impact on improving policies and community well-being are explored here. This demonstrates Anielski&#x27;s claim that these measures can influence better futures, though, as you noted, the broader global adoption and effectiveness of such measures might seem overly optimistic given current global challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, while Anielski&#x27;s assertions are supported by the chapters, the practical impact and widespread adoption of these holistic measures in influencing policy on a global scale might indeed appear idealistic, especially considering the increasing environmental and social challenges faced worldwide. The question of whether governments should prioritize more concrete solutions over idealistic ones is valid and underscores a global debate on the efficacy of such innovative yet untraditional approaches."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "72a182ba-a976-4ae3-9e86-bc466bae5ce0", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "882676c71e34bb20-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "72a182ba-a976-4ae3-9e86-bc466bae5ce0", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "420f98ea-f1e3-4f98-a15f-ae677462af07", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "d3959edc-e60d-437b-b13b-64ae872940e0", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": ["well-being.net"], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "d3959edc-e60d-437b-b13b-64ae872940e0"}, {"title": "Sustainable Metrics for Italy", "create_time": 1715470165.667471, "update_time": 1715470170.9648, "mapping": {"5f450452-b6ba-4f11-ad1b-ad3307e02232": {"id": "5f450452-b6ba-4f11-ad1b-ad3307e02232", "message": {"id": "5f450452-b6ba-4f11-ad1b-ad3307e02232", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa10540-d5f4-4637-b37a-77bba69a4b35", "children": ["aaa291ad-175a-4707-9538-4b97af7db7cd"]}, "aaa10540-d5f4-4637-b37a-77bba69a4b35": {"id": "aaa10540-d5f4-4637-b37a-77bba69a4b35", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["5f450452-b6ba-4f11-ad1b-ad3307e02232"]}, "aaa291ad-175a-4707-9538-4b97af7db7cd": {"id": "aaa291ad-175a-4707-9538-4b97af7db7cd", "message": {"id": "aaa291ad-175a-4707-9538-4b97af7db7cd", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715470165.671194, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Based on the rubric and the composition below it,  did the person adequately meet the rubric?\n\n\nDettagli rubrica compito\nChiudi\nRubrica\nDiscussion Question Rubric 5.23 (1)\nDiscussion Question Rubric 5.23 (1)\nCriteri\tValutazioni\tPt\nQuesto criterio \u00e8 collegato a un esito di apprendimentoContent\n\u2022 Posts original and well-developed initial response that addresses the discussion question prompt.\n\u2022 Provides details, explanations, and examples.\n\u2022 Supports writing with course content (literature, readings, and media).\nQuesta area verr\u00e0 utilizzata dall&#x27;esaminatore per lasciare commenti relativi a questo criterio.\n15 pt\nQuesto criterio \u00e8 collegato a un esito di apprendimentoCritical Analysis\n\u2022 Compares, contrasts, and/or integrates theory and course content with work environment or experience.\n\u2022 Analyzes or criticizes course materials or concepts.\n\u2022 Incorporates theory and/or practice to develop new ideas and ways of conceptualizing.\nQuesta area verr\u00e0 utilizzata dall&#x27;esaminatore per lasciare commenti relativi a questo criterio.\n10 pt\nQuesto criterio \u00e8 collegato a un esito di apprendimentoClarity, Mechanics, and Organization\n\u2022 Demonstrates graduate level writing with correct grammar, spelling, punctuation, and evidence of proofreading.\n\u2022 Structure of responses are clear, logical, and easy to follow.\nQuesta area verr\u00e0 utilizzata dall&#x27;esaminatore per lasciare commenti relativi a questo criterio.\n10 pt\nQuesto criterio \u00e8 collegato a un esito di apprendimentoAPA Standards\n\u2022 Cites course content according to APA standards with in-text citations and references.\nQuesta area verr\u00e0 utilizzata dall&#x27;esaminatore per lasciare commenti relativi a questo criterio.\n5 pt\nQuesto criterio \u00e8 collegato a un esito di apprendimentoParticipation: Responses to Peers Posts\n\u2022 Responds substantively to at least two classmates.\n\u2022 Builds on the discussion by adding own examples, course materials, asking questions, etc.\n\n* Note: Late responses to peers are not accepted.\nQuesta area verr\u00e0 utilizzata dall&#x27;esaminatore per lasciare commenti relativi a questo criterio.\n10 pt\nPunti totali: 50\n\nPart 1: Pick a country to assess. Create a set of up to 10 metrics \u2013 including economic, environmental, and social indicators \u2013 that you believe should be incorporated into the national sustainability planning for that country. Research the country\u2019s performance against these metrics and create a \u2018country profile\u2019 briefly explaining why you chose these indicators, how your country performed, and innovative ideas you might have for increasing their sustainability across social, economic, and environmental measures.\nOkay, I will say it over and over again. I will say it until it ends or there is no more breath in my body: Capitalism is a cancer to humanity, and until we heal the cancer, we are merely trying to bail out a sinking ship with a teaspoon and an idealistic plan. To envision a future where resources are sustainably maintained, I keep returning to the same thought. As long as profit remains the bottom line for countries and all activities are measured solely by their economic effects, we sabotage our success before we even begin. We sabotage society by not prioritizing our primary objective, which should be societal well-being and happiness. Unfortunately, profit is the primary objective in a capitalist society, not societal well-being. Therefore, the ten metrics I would propose for Italy&#x27;s sustainability planning: \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: This is a measure of economic activity within a country. It\u2019s not a measure of wealth or productivity but is often used as such.\nGini Coefficient: This is a measure of inequality in a society. A lower Gini Coefficient indicates a more equal distribution of wealth.\nEnvironmental Performance Index (EPI): measures a nation\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions: This is a measure of a country\u2019s impact on climate change.\nRenewable Energy Consumption: The nation\u2019s percentage of total energy consumption that comes from renewable sources.\nEducation Index: This is a component of the Human Development Index (HDI) and measures years of schooling for adults and expected years of schooling for children.\nLife Expectancy at Birth: This is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, assuming that current mortality rates remain constant throughout their lifetime.\nCultural Diversity Index: This measures a country&#x27;s cultural diversity, including languages, ethnicities, and religions.\nHappiness Index: This measures subjective well-being and asks people to rate their overall satisfaction with life.\nSocial Support Index: This measures the level of social support an average individual has, which is crucial for mental health and well-being.\nHowever, these metrics do not truly indicate where Italy or any country is at because they are based on the platform of capitalism. The financial metrics heavily influences the social and environmental indicators and all non-financial metrics. Ultimately, a country&#x27;s ability to sustainably manage resources depends on its economic resources and regulation of commerce.\nUpon reviewing the data presented by the Happiness Index, Italy ranks 18th globally. However, regarding metrics concerning sustainable practices and pollution, Italy finds itself in the red. While the economic situation in Italy is less favorable than one would hope, wage inequality runs rampant. Simultaneously, as in many other nations worldwide, inflation abounds, particularly in the housing market. One may wonder how the 18th most happy country out of over 120 nations (Happy Planet Index \u2013 Good Lives Don\u2019t Have to Cost the Earth, n.d.) can experience such issues. Would it be premature to assign blame to capitalism?\n\n\nBefore Italy became the republic it is today, a place I live, know, and love, there were the evil fascists who committed atrocities such as giving land to people, constructing entire blocks and neighborhoods, and creating a sense of nationalism and unity under one Italian flag. Finally, they empowered a man whom my Italian-born and bred fiance described as &quot;inferiority complex...pavido... apathetic, rapist.&quot; Of course, he referred to the austere and shining figure of Italian fascism, il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Back then, they had a different system, perhaps less democratic, but seemingly more for the people with arguably better, more sustainable industrial, commercial, and lifestyle practices. However, that is a paradox for another discussion post. \n\n\nToday, in Italy&#x27;s economic climate, there is some uncertainty amongst the populace regarding the feasibility and sustainability of Capitalism, both locally and internationally. The causes and effects of these uncertainties affect their overall well-being. Thus, the first measure of my criteria is the people&#x27;s ability to earn a living, essentially their economic ability to achieve their most important ends - clean water, food, housing, and healthcare. These necessities are the most crucial gross domestic products to consider. Hence, Italy&#x27;s GDP and Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality within a nation (The World Bank, 2024), should factor into its national sustainability plan. Italy has fared well so far, but like many other places, it could do better.\n\n\nItaly\u2019s GDP per capita stands at approximately $34,776.40, reflecting a robust economic framework, yet this figure only skims the surface of the nation\u2019s broader socio-economic reality (The World Bank, 2024). The Gini Coefficient 34.8 signals significant income disparity, an issue that economic indicators alone cannot resolve (The World Bank, 2024). \nItaly\u2019s moderate Environmental Performance Index (EPI) score of 57.70 suggests a commitment to environmental sustainability, but there is substantial room for improvement, especially in enhancing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions further and bolster renewable energy initiatives (Yale University., 2024). The nation\u2019s push towards renewable energy is commendable, with 32.4% of its electricity demand met by renewables as of 2022 (International Trade Administration, 2023). Such efforts are crucial in transitioning to a sustainable energy future. Moreover, Italy\u2019s high life expectancy of 82.8 years (Happy Planet Index \u2013 Good Lives Don\u2019t Have to Cost the Earth, n.d.) and a moderate Happiness Index score of 6.26 (Italy | Environmental Performance Index, n.d.) reflect a society that enjoys a good quality of life. Yet, these figures mask the underlying challenges of social inequality and environmental concerns (Rowan, 2023).\nGiven these data points, Italy\u2019s sustainability planning should pivot from a purely capitalist focus to a more holistic approach that balances economic performance with social equity and environmental stewardship. The drive towards a sustainable future in Italy could be likened to the intricate art of making the perfect tiramisu\u2014meticulously balancing the bitter with the sweet to achieve harmony. Achieving a balance between economic growth, social equity, and environmental conservation is crucial to securing a better future for Italy. Although a complete overhaul of the current capitalist system is unlikely, it is vital that the country strives to create a more cooperative and equitable global community. By prioritizing societal well-being, Italy can foster sustainable practices that promote the health and prosperity of both its citizens and the planet.\n\n\nPart 2: \nShould international governmental organizations, such as the United Nations, the IMF, and World Bank, adopt new economic metrics that incorporate social well-being and environmental resource utilization into their economic modeling?\n\nYes, the organizations referenced above should adopt new metrics that measure more than the economic value of an action or activity. The economic value of an action does not always reflect its contribution to society&#x27;s overall well-being (Sturgeon, 2019). \nTo what degree have they adopted these types of metrics already?\n Some organizations and nations have begun to adopt more holistic metrics; however, the degree to which these metrics have been implemented varies from aspirational to newly implemented (Enhancing IMF-World Bank Collaboration, n.d.; Incorporating Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Factors Into Fixed Income Investments, n.d.).  \nWhat is the argument for and/or against this type of shift in performance measurement? \nThe argument is straightforward: economic indicators fail to capture the full societal benefits. Therefore, we need additional metrics that can measure and indicate the overall benefits, including those relevant to national and global sustainable planning (Sturgeon, 2019).  \nHow could this spur a more holistic and transparent view of economies, social progress, and environmental sustainability?\nBy prioritizing what truly matters and allocating our attention accordingly, we can expect to see a decline in misguided policies and economic systems that lack insight and compassion. When we accurately gauge what needs to be measured, we can more readily identify aspects that detract from the well-being of society as a whole.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8825f3761b00ba8b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5f450452-b6ba-4f11-ad1b-ad3307e02232", "children": ["08b6a35a-879b-483a-87bb-df54c7d47478"]}, "08b6a35a-879b-483a-87bb-df54c7d47478": {"id": "08b6a35a-879b-483a-87bb-df54c7d47478", "message": {"id": "08b6a35a-879b-483a-87bb-df54c7d47478", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715470170.19035, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Based on the provided rubric, let&#x27;s assess the person&#x27;s response:\n\n1. **Content (15/15 points):** The response addresses the discussion question prompt by proposing a set of metrics for Italy&#x27;s sustainability planning and discussing the current economic climate and potential improvements.

Is it premature to assign the blame to Capitalism?\n\n\nBefore Italy became the republic it is today, a place I know and love, there were the evil fascists who committed atrocities such as giving land to people, constructing entire blocks and neighborhoods, and creating a sense of nationalism and unity under one Italian flag. Finally, they empowered a man, whom my Italian-born and bred fiance described as &quot;inferiority complex...pavido..., apathetic, rapist.&quot; Of course, he referred to the austere and shining figure of Italian fascism, il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Back then, they had a different system, perhaps less democratic, but seemingly more for the people with arguably better, more sustainable industrial, commercial, and lifestyle practices. However, that is a paradox for another discussion post. \n\n\nToday, in Italy&#x27;s economic climate, there is some uncertainty amongst the populace regarding the feasibility and sustainability of Capitalism, both locally and internationally. The causes and effects of these uncertainties affect their overall well-being. Thus, the first measure of my criteria is the people&#x27;s ability to earn a living, essentially their economic ability to achieve their most important ends - clean water, food, housing, and healthcare. These necessities are the most crucial gross domestic products to consider. Hence, Italy&#x27;s GDP, as well as its Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality within a nation, should factor into its national sustainability plan. Italy seems to have fared well so far, but like many other places, it could do better.\nInsert data-rich descriptive and supporting paragraph  based around this info cited in apa 7 format with apa reference list at end: \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: As of 2022, Italy\u2019s GDP per capita was approximately $33,28112.\nGini Coefficient: The Gini Coefficient for Italy, which measures income inequality, was around 34.8 in 20213.\nEnvironmental Performance Index (EPI): Italy\u2019s EPI score was approximately 57.7456, indicating a moderate commitment to environmental sustainability.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions: Italy has made efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions7891011.

The selected metrics\u2014GDP per capita, Gini Coefficient, EPI, and others\u2014offer a multi-dimensional view of Italy&#x27;s progress and challenges in both economic and socio-environmental realms. In 2022, Italy\u2019s GDP per capita was approximately $33,281, reflecting its status as a developed economy, though this figure alone does not capture the nuances of wealth distribution or productivity (1). This is underscored by Italy\u2019s Gini Coefficient of about 34.8 in 2021, indicating a moderate level of income inequality within the country (2). \n\nEnvironmental sustainability, as measured by the EPI score of approximately 57.74, shows Italy\u2019s moderate commitment to environmental health and vitality (3). Despite significant efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the effectiveness of these initiatives fluctuates, highlighting the complexity of sustainable environmental management (4). On a brighter note, Italy\u2019s shift towards renewable energy is commendable, with renewables accounting for about 32.4% of its electricity demand by 2022, showcasing a successful transition in energy consumption (5).\n\nThe educational achievements are notable, with Italy demonstrating a high level of educational commitment, though specific data for an &quot;Education Index&quot; was not directly available (6).

Research the country\u2019s performance against these metrics and create a \u2018country profile\u2019 briefly explaining why you chose these indicators, how your country performed, and innovative ideas you might have for increasing their sustainability across social, economic, and environmental measures.\nComplete the passage below to answer the question above and follow the insert prompts . \n\nOkay, I\u2019ll say it over and over again. I\u2019ll say it until it ends or there is no more breath in my body: Capitalism is a cancer to humanity and until we kill the cancer we are merely trying to bail out a sinking ship with a teaspoon and an idealistic plan. To envision a future where resources are sustainably maintained, I keep coming back to the same thought: as long as profit remains the bottom line for countries, and all activities are measured solely by their economic effects, we sabotage our success before we even begin. This is because we do not prioritize our primary objective, which should be societal well-being and happiness. Unfortunately, in a capitalist society, profit is the primary objective, not societal well-being. Therefore, the 10 metrics I would propose for Italy&#x27;s sustainability planning: \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: This is a measure of economic activity within a country. It\u2019s not a measure of wealth or productivity but is often used as such.\nGini Coefficient: This is a measure of inequality in a society. A lower Gini Coefficient indicates a more equal distribution of wealth.\nEnvironmental Performance Index (EPI): This index measures a nation\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions: This is a measure of a country\u2019s impact on climate change.\nRenewable Energy Consumption: The percentage of total energy consumption that comes from renewable sources.\nEducation Index: This is a component of the Human Development Index (HDI) and is a measure of years of schooling for adults and expected years of schooling for children.\nLife Expectancy at Birth: This is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, assuming that current mortality rates remain constant throughout their lifetime.\nCultural Diversity Index: This measures the cultural diversity in a country, including languages, ethnicities, and religions.\nHappiness Index: This measures subjective well-being and asks people to rate their overall satisfaction with life.\nSocial Support Index: This measures the level of social support an average individual has, which is crucial for mental health and well-being.\ndo not truly indicate where Italy or any country is at, because they are based on the platform of capitalism. The social and environmental indicators, as well as all non-financial metrics, are heavily influenced by the financial metrics. Ultimately, a country&#x27;s ability to sustainably manage resources depends on its financial resources and regulation of commerce.\nUpon reviewing the data presented by the Happiness Index, Italy ranks 18th globally. However, in terms of metrics concerning sustainable practices and pollution, Italy finds itself in the red. While the economic situation in Italy is not as positive as one would hope, wage inequality runs rampant. Simultaneously, as in many other nations currently around the world, inflation, particularly in the housing market, abounds. One may wonder how the 18th most happy country, out of over 120 nations, can experience such issues. Is it premature to assign the blame to Capitalism?\n\n\nBefore Italy became the republic it is today, a place I know and love, there were the evil fascists who committed atrocities such as giving land to people, constructing entire blocks and neighborhoods, and creating a sense of nationalism and unity under one Italian flag. Finally, they empowered a man, whom my Italian-born and bred fiance described as &quot;inferiority complex...pavido..., apathetic, rapist.&quot; Of course, he referred to the austere and shining figure of Italian fascism, il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Back then, they had a different system, perhaps less democratic, but seemingly more for the people with arguably better, more sustainable industrial, commercial, and lifestyle practices. However, that is a paradox for another discussion post. \n\n\nToday, in Italy&#x27;s economic climate, there is some uncertainty amongst the populace regarding the feasibility and sustainability of Capitalism, both locally and internationally. The causes and effects of these uncertainties affect their overall well-being. Thus, the first measure of my criteria is the people&#x27;s ability to earn a living, essentially their economic ability to achieve their most important ends - clean water, food, housing, and healthcare. These necessities are the most crucial gross domestic products to consider. Hence, Italy&#x27;s GDP, as well as its Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality within a nation, should factor into its national sustainability plan.

While it&#x27;s clear that financial health is imperative for sustaining basic societal functions, the focus on capitalism alone overshadows equally critical social and environmental concerns.\n\nItaly&#x27;s GDP per capita stands at approximately $33,281, reflecting a robust economic framework, yet this figure only skims the surface of the nation&#x27;s broader socio-economic reality. The Gini Coefficient, at 34.8, signals significant income disparity, an issue that economic indicators alone cannot resolve. Italy\u2019s moderate Environmental Performance Index (EPI) score of 57.7456 suggests a commitment to environmental sustainability, but there&#x27;s substantial room for improvement, especially in enhancing policies to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and bolster renewable energy initiatives.\n\nThe nation&#x27;s push towards renewable energy is commendable, with 32.4% of its electricity demand met by renewables as of 2022. Such efforts are crucial in transitioning to a sustainable energy future. Moreover, Italy\u2019s high life expectancy of 82.8 years and a moderate Happiness Index score of 6.47 reflect a society that enjoys a good quality of life, yet these figures mask the underlying challenges of social inequality and environmental concerns.\n\nGiven these data points, Italy\u2019s sustainability planning should pivot from a purely capitalist focus to a more holistic approach that balances economic performance with social equity and environmental stewardship. The drive towards a sustainable future in Italy could be likened to the intricate art of making a perfect espresso\u2014meticulously balancing the bitter with the sweet to achieve harmony. As Italy moves forward, it must blend economic robustness with social justice and environmental care, ensuring that its sustainability is as enduring as its cultural legacy.\n\n**References:**\n1.

For example, they can contain high levels of B vitamins, iron, magnesium, selenium, and fatty acids.\n3. **Hypoallergenic**: Insect protein can be a good alternative for dogs that are allergic to more common protein sources like chicken or beef.\n4. **Sustainable**: Insects are a more environmentally friendly source of protein since they require less land, water, and food than traditional livestock.\n\nCommon insects used in dog food include crickets, black soldier fly larvae, and mealworms. These insects are usually processed into a meal or powder and added to kibble or wet food formulations.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to ensure that any insects fed to dogs are sourced from safe, reputable suppliers that prepare them specifically for pet consumption.

Some dogs might need more or less protein or other nutrients than others.\n\n4. **Allergies or Sensitivities**: If your dog has food allergies or sensitivities, confirm that none of the ingredients in the food are known allergens for your pet.\n\n5. **Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing**: If sustainability and ethical practices are important to you, research the brand\u2019s sourcing and manufacturing processes. Many companies that produce insect-based dog food are keen on promoting these aspects.\n\n6. **Reviews and Recommendations**: Look for reviews from other pet owners who have tried this food.

White privilege refers to the societal advantages that white people experience simply by virtue of being white, often at the expense of people of color. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Representation in Media**: White people are more likely to see people who look like them represented positively and frequently in mainstream media, including movies, television shows, and advertisements. People of color are often underrepresented or portrayed in stereotypical and limited roles.\n\n2. **Access to Education**: White students are more likely to attend well-funded schools with experienced teachers and a wide range of academic opportunities. People of color, especially those from low-income communities, often attend underfunded schools with fewer resources and higher rates of discipline.\n\n3. **Employment Opportunities**: White job applicants are more likely to be hired and promoted compared to equally qualified applicants of color. This is due to biases in hiring processes, as well as networks and connections that often exclude people of color.\n\n4. **Criminal Justice System**: White people are less likely to be stopped, arrested, or sentenced harshly compared to people of color for the same offenses. This disparity is evident in various stages of the criminal justice system, including policing, prosecution, and sentencing.\n\n5. **Access to Healthcare**: White people generally have better access to quality healthcare services, including health insurance coverage and medical facilities. People of color often face barriers such as discrimination, lack of culturally competent care, and limited access to healthcare facilities in their communities.\n\n6. **Housing Discrimination**: White people are more likely to secure housing in desirable neighborhoods with higher property values and better amenities. People of color often face discrimination in housing markets, including redlining and racial steering, which limit their housing options and perpetuate segregation.\n\n7. **Social and Cultural Norms**: White cultural norms and values are often considered the default in society, while the experiences and perspectives of people of color are marginalized or ignored. This can manifest in various ways, from language and dress codes to beauty standards and social interactions.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how white privilege operates in society. It&#x27;s important to recognize that white privilege doesn&#x27;t mean that individual white people haven&#x27;t faced hardships or struggles in their lives, but rather that systemic advantages exist for them based on their race."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "default_model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2f922-d349-4b37-9758-cb995757e550", "request_id": "880533570b2cbaee-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2f922-d349-4b37-9758-cb995757e550", "children": ["aaa25641-fd7b-4627-b693-fb4996bc0524"]}, "aaa25641-fd7b-4627-b693-fb4996bc0524": {"id": "aaa25641-fd7b-4627-b693-fb4996bc0524", "message": {"id": "aaa25641-fd7b-4627-b693-fb4996bc0524", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715127107.924396, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["is there white priveledge to access to education in italy? can you give examples with sources?

However, there are still instances where certain groups, often those perceived as &quot;white&quot; or of European descent, may have advantages in accessing education compared to others.\n\nHere are some examples of disparities in access to education in Italy:\n\n1. **Migrant Children and Education**: Children of migrants, particularly those from non-European countries, often face barriers in accessing education in Italy. According to a report by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) in 2019, migrant children are more likely to drop out of school compared to Italian children. This can be due to factors such as language barriers, discrimination, and lack of support systems.\n\n2. **Segregation in Schools**: There have been instances of segregation and discrimination in Italian schools, particularly against Roma and Sinti children. A report by Amnesty International in 2018 highlighted how Roma and Sinti children are often placed in separate classes or schools, limiting their access to quality education and perpetuating social exclusion.\n\n3. **Language Barriers**: Children from immigrant families, especially those whose first language is not Italian, may face challenges in the education system due to language barriers. While there are support programs such as Italian language courses for immigrant children, these may not always be sufficient to address the linguistic and cultural needs of all students.\n\n4. **Access to Higher Education**: Despite legal provisions for equal access to higher education, students from marginalized backgrounds may still face obstacles in pursuing higher education in Italy. This can include financial barriers, lack of information about available opportunities, and discrimination in admissions processes.\n\n5. **Racial Discrimination**: Discrimination based on race or ethnicity can affect students&#x27; experiences in Italian schools, including interactions with teachers and peers, disciplinary practices, and opportunities for academic and extracurricular activities. While there is limited research specifically on racial discrimination in Italian schools, anecdotal evidence and reports from advocacy groups suggest that it remains a concern.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to note that while Italy does not have the same history of racial segregation and discrimination as countries like the United States, issues of inequality and discrimination still exist and can impact access to education for marginalized groups, including immigrants and ethnic minorities.\n\nSources:\n1.

It&#x27;s clear that he values seeing people as individuals and wants to promote equality. Recognizing his intentions can help set a positive tone for the conversation.\n\n2. **Share Your Personal Experience**: Explain to your partner how your experiences as a Black person from America have shaped your understanding of privilege and identity. Share specific examples of how your race has influenced the way you are perceived and treated in various situations, including in education, employment, and social interactions.\n\n3. **Discuss Systemic Inequality**: Help your partner understand that while it&#x27;s admirable to see everyone as equals, systemic inequalities based on race still exist. These inequalities can affect access to opportunities, resources, and treatment in society. Share statistics and research to illustrate the disparities that persist, even if they may not be immediately apparent to him.\n\n4. **Highlight Your Partner&#x27;s Privileges**: Encourage your partner to reflect on his own privileges, such as being white and not having to navigate certain challenges that come with being a person of color. Help him understand that acknowledging these privileges doesn&#x27;t diminish his worth as an individual but can instead foster empathy and awareness of others&#x27; experiences.\n\n5. **Explain the Importance of Cultural Identity**: Share with your partner why cultural identity is meaningful to you and why it&#x27;s not something you can simply choose to ignore. Explain how cultural identity shapes one&#x27;s sense of self, community, and belonging, and how it can influence various aspects of life, including language, traditions, and perspectives.\n\n6. **Encourage Open Dialogue**: Emphasize the importance of having open and honest conversations about these topics, even if they may be uncomfortable at times. Encourage your partner to ask questions and express any concerns or uncertainties he may have, and be prepared to listen and respond empathetically.\n\nBy approaching the conversation with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to engage with each other&#x27;s perspectives, you and your partner can deepen your understanding of privilege, identity, and the complexities of navigating these issues in society."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "default_model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "pad": "AAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa23f94-a560-4af4-a9ad-523b3ec9781a", "request_id": "8805b54f2c86bac9-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa23f94-a560-4af4-a9ad-523b3ec9781a", "children": ["aaa298f1-a2bd-4cd8-9a44-565184002bb2"]}, "aaa298f1-a2bd-4cd8-9a44-565184002bb2": {"id": "aaa298f1-a2bd-4cd8-9a44-565184002bb2", "message": {"id": "aaa298f1-a2bd-4cd8-9a44-565184002bb2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715132193.297189, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["but my partner is one of those people who feel like they know what they know and if reports and facts don&#x27;t align with what they know, they discount them"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8805b82eca4d839a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c27cc30c-864b-4530-bde0-57978c572171", "children": ["d053184f-7fde-490f-94bb-1477b7b6eeee"]}, "d053184f-7fde-490f-94bb-1477b7b6eeee": {"id": "d053184f-7fde-490f-94bb-1477b7b6eeee", "message": {"id": "d053184f-7fde-490f-94bb-1477b7b6eeee", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715132199.196007, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Navigating conversations with someone who is resistant to new information or alternative perspectives can be challenging. Here are some strategies you might consider when discussing privilege and identity with your partner:\n\n1. **Start with Shared Values**: Begin the conversation by emphasizing shared values, such as a commitment to fairness, equality, and empathy. By framing the discussion in terms of values you both hold dear, you may create a more receptive environment for exploring difficult topics.\n\n2. **Use Personal Stories**: Sometimes, personal anecdotes and stories can be more impactful than statistics or reports. Share your own experiences with your partner and encourage them to do the same. Personal stories can help humanize the issues and foster empathy and understanding.\n\n3. **Appeal to Empathy**: Help your partner understand the importance of empathy in understanding the experiences of others. Encourage them to imagine themselves in someone else&#x27;s shoes and consider how they might feel or react in similar situations. Emphasize that empathy is not about agreeing with or condoning others&#x27; experiences but about recognizing and validating their feelings and perspectives.\n\n4. **Provide Relatable Examples**: Offer examples of privilege and discrimination that your partner can relate to in their own life. This could include instances where they may have benefited from privilege or instances where they have witnessed discrimination firsthand. Relatable examples can make abstract concepts more tangible and easier to understand.\n\n5. **Encourage Critical Thinking**: Encourage your partner to approach new information with an open mind and a willingness to critically evaluate their own beliefs and assumptions. Remind them that learning and growth often require questioning and challenging our existing knowledge and perspectives.\n\n6. **Seek Professional Help**: If you find that discussions with your partner consistently reach an impasse or become emotionally charged, consider seeking the guidance of a professional counselor or therapist. A neutral third party can provide support and facilitate constructive dialogue in a safe and respectful environment.\n\nUltimately, fostering open communication, empathy, and a willingness to engage with uncomfortable topics can help bridge the gap between differing perspectives and promote understanding and growth within your relationship."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "default_model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "pad": "A", "parent_id": "aaa298f1-a2bd-4cd8-9a44-565184002bb2", "request_id": "8805b82eca4d839a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa298f1-a2bd-4cd8-9a44-565184002bb2", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "d053184f-7fde-490f-94bb-1477b7b6eeee", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "3d380f0f-8779-4898-a042-489dc58b665d", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "3d380f0f-8779-4898-a042-489dc58b665d"}, {"title": "Fascist Principles Explained", "create_time": 1715127695.422649, "update_time": 1715127703.524612, "mapping": {"bd41414c-a9dc-42ab-8f94-638fc3d44342": {"id": "bd41414c-a9dc-42ab-8f94-638fc3d44342", "message": {"id": "bd41414c-a9dc-42ab-8f94-638fc3d44342", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa170a7-7ea9-4828-b308-3250f6d2a7b2", "children": ["aaa210ce-a51d-4da4-ba1a-67d9a52c92c4"]}, "aaa170a7-7ea9-4828-b308-3250f6d2a7b2": {"id": "aaa170a7-7ea9-4828-b308-3250f6d2a7b2", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["bd41414c-a9dc-42ab-8f94-638fc3d44342"]}, "aaa210ce-a51d-4da4-ba1a-67d9a52c92c4": {"id": "aaa210ce-a51d-4da4-ba1a-67d9a52c92c4", "message": {"id": "aaa210ce-a51d-4da4-ba1a-67d9a52c92c4", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715127695.424661, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["principles of fascism"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "88054a5f3a190d68-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "bd41414c-a9dc-42ab-8f94-638fc3d44342", "children": ["52937bd5-6f4c-4d0a-9621-ded0430504d0"]}, "52937bd5-6f4c-4d0a-9621-ded0430504d0": {"id": "52937bd5-6f4c-4d0a-9621-ded0430504d0", "message": {"id": "52937bd5-6f4c-4d0a-9621-ded0430504d0", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715127703.018478, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Fascism is a complex and controversial ideology that emerged in the early 20th century, particularly in Italy under Benito Mussolini and Germany under Adolf Hitler. While there isn&#x27;t a single, universally agreed-upon set of principles of fascism, there are common themes and characteristics typically associated with fascist movements. Here are some of them:\n\n1. **Authoritarianism**: Fascism advocates for a strong, centralized government led by a single leader or dictator. This leader often has almost absolute power and authority over the state.\n\n2. **Nationalism**: Fascism emphasizes the importance of the nation or ethnic group above all else. It promotes a sense of national unity, pride, and superiority, often at the expense of other nations or groups deemed inferior.\n\n3. **Totalitarianism**: Fascist regimes seek to control all aspects of society, including politics, the economy, culture, and even private life. They often employ censorship, propaganda, and repression to maintain control and suppress dissent.\n\n4. **Militarism**: Fascism glorifies war and military strength as essential components of national greatness. It often seeks to expand territory through conquest and views military aggression as a legitimate means to achieve national goals.\n\n5. **Anti-democracy**: Fascism rejects liberal democracy and views it as weak, decadent, and inefficient. Instead, it advocates for a form of &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;integral&quot; democracy, in which the nation is represented by a single party or leader who embodies the will of the people.\n\n6. **Social hierarchy**: Fascism promotes the idea of a hierarchical society, with certain groups (usually defined by race, ethnicity, or nationality) considered superior to others. It often discriminates against minority groups and seeks to maintain the dominance of the ruling class.\n\n7. **Corporate statism**: Fascism advocates for close collaboration between the state and large corporations, with the state playing a dominant role in directing economic activity. This form of corporatism is intended to promote national unity and economic development.\n\n8. **Cult of personality**: Fascist leaders are often elevated to near-divine status and portrayed as charismatic saviors or strongmen who can rescue the nation from crisis and lead it to greatness.\n\n9. **Scapegoating and propaganda**: Fascist regimes often scapegoat minority groups, political opponents, or external enemies for societal problems or national decline. Propaganda is used to manipulate public opinion and rally support for the regime&#x27;s policies.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to note that while these principles capture common features of fascism, the ideology can manifest differently in different contexts and historical periods. Additionally, not all fascist movements adhere strictly to all of these principles, and there is ongoing debate among scholars about the precise definition and characteristics of fascism."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "default_model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa210ce-a51d-4da4-ba1a-67d9a52c92c4", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "88054a5f3a190d68-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa210ce-a51d-4da4-ba1a-67d9a52c92c4", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "52937bd5-6f4c-4d0a-9621-ded0430504d0", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "509c0aa6-2990-4fda-8b46-429bcd682c05", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "text-davinci-002-render-sha", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "509c0aa6-2990-4fda-8b46-429bcd682c05"}, {"title": "Salted Baccal\u00e0 Recipe", "create_time": 1715110930.110126, "update_time": 1715111609.357376, "mapping": {"0b4892ae-e744-4067-bd50-32ea8be20932": {"id": "0b4892ae-e744-4067-bd50-32ea8be20932", "message": {"id": "0b4892ae-e744-4067-bd50-32ea8be20932", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "3001e53d-81b6-4e7f-a5df-5ef62ea31823", "children": ["25377846-e8a2-4d52-8722-99f48892f646"]}, "3001e53d-81b6-4e7f-a5df-5ef62ea31823": {"id": "3001e53d-81b6-4e7f-a5df-5ef62ea31823", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["0b4892ae-e744-4067-bd50-32ea8be20932"]}, "25377846-e8a2-4d52-8722-99f48892f646": {"id": "25377846-e8a2-4d52-8722-99f48892f646", "message": {"id": "25377846-e8a2-4d52-8722-99f48892f646", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715110930.111493, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Recipes for salted baccal\u00e0 "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8803b1101cee0e49-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "0b4892ae-e744-4067-bd50-32ea8be20932", "children": ["c9d7409b-d955-4305-b1e6-9ca3e83bb074"]}, "c9d7409b-d955-4305-b1e6-9ca3e83bb074": {"id": "c9d7409b-d955-4305-b1e6-9ca3e83bb074", "message": {"id": "c9d7409b-d955-4305-b1e6-9ca3e83bb074", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715110934.097104, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Salted baccal\u00e0, or salt cod, is a classic ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine.
