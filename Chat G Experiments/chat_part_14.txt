Effective management ensures the sustainable use of water, balancing human needs with environmental protection. Here&#x27;s an overview of the global context and the relevance of the water bottling industry:\n\n### Global Context of Water Resources Management\n\n1. **Water Scarcity and Stress**:\n   - Over 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress.\n   - Climate change exacerbates water scarcity by altering precipitation patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events.\n\n2. **Population Growth**:\n   - The global population is projected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050, increasing the demand for water for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use.\n\n3. **Agricultural Demand**:\n   - Agriculture accounts for about 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, making efficient water use in this sector crucial for food security and sustainability.\n\n4. **Pollution and Quality**:\n   - Industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and inadequate wastewater treatment contribute to water pollution, affecting both human health and ecosystems.\n\n5. **Transboundary Water Management**:\n   - Many water bodies cross national borders, requiring cooperation between countries to manage shared resources sustainably.\n\n### Relevance of the Water Bottling Industry\n\n1. **Market Growth**:\n   - The bottled water industry has seen significant growth, driven by concerns about water quality, convenience, and health.\n\n2. **Economic Impact**:\n   - The industry provides jobs and economic benefits in regions with bottling plants and contributes to local economies through sales and distribution networks.\n\n3. **Environmental Concerns**:\n   - The production and disposal of plastic bottles contribute to environmental pollution. The industry faces criticism for its role in plastic waste and its carbon footprint from production and transportation.\n\n4. **Resource Extraction**:\n   - Bottling companies often extract large quantities of groundwater, which can lead to depletion of local water resources and impact communities and ecosystems.\n\n5. **Regulatory and Sustainability Efforts**:\n   - There is increasing pressure on the water bottling industry to adopt sustainable practices, including improved water management, reduction of plastic use, and enhanced recycling efforts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEffective water resources management is essential to address global challenges such as water scarcity, pollution, and climate change. The water bottling industry, while economically significant, must navigate environmental and social concerns to ensure sustainable and equitable access to water resources."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Water-related disasters account for 70% of all deaths related to natural disasters. The World Bank helps countries ensure sustainability of water use, build climate resilience and strengthen integrated management.\n\n  * Context &amp; Challenges\n  * Strategy\n  * Results &amp; Initiatives\n\nToday, most countries are placing unprecedented pressure on water resources. The global population is growing fast, and estimates show that with current practices, the world will face a 40% shortfall between forecast demand and available supply of water by 2030. Furthermore, chronic water scarcity, hydrological uncertainty, and extreme weather events (floods and droughts) are perceived as some of the biggest threats to global prosperity and stability. Acknowledgment of the role that water scarcity and drought are playing in aggravating fragility and conflict is increasing.\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020View the Full Infographic&gt;&gt;\u3011\n\nFeeding \u3010331\u202010 billion people by 2050 will require a 50% increase in agricultural production\u2020www.unwater.org\u3011, (which consumes 70% of the resource today), and a 15%\u00a0increase in water withdrawals. Besides this increasing demand, the resource is already scarce in many parts of the world. Estimates indicate that over 40% of the world population live in water scarce areas, and approximately \u00bc of world\u2019s GDP is exposed to this challenge. \u3010332\u2020By 2040, an estimated one in four children will live in areas with extreme water shortages\u2020mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms\u3011.\u00a0Water security is a major \u2013 and often growing \u2013challenge for many countries today.\n\nClimate change will worsen the situation by altering hydrological cycles, making water more unpredictable and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. The roughly 1 billion people living in monsoonal basins and the 500 million people living in deltas are especially vulnerable.\u00a0 Flood damages are estimated around $120 billion per year (only from property damage), and droughts pose, among others, constraints to the rural poor, highly dependent on rainfall variability for subsistence.\u00a0\n\nThe fragmentation of this resource also constrains water security. There are 276 transboundary basins, shared by 148 countries, which account for 60% of the global freshwater flow. Similarly, 300 aquifers systems are transboundary in nature, with 2.5 billion people worldwide are dependent on groundwater. The challenges of fragmentation are often replicated at the national scale, meaning cooperation is needed to achieve optimal water resources management and development solutions for all riparians. To deal with these complex and interlinked water challenges, countries will need to improve the way they manage their water resources and associated services.\n\nTo strengthen water security against this backdrop of increasing demand, water scarcity, growing uncertainty, greater extremes, and fragmentation challenges, clients will need to invest in institutional strengthening, information management, and (natural and man-made) infrastructure development. Institutional tools such as legal and regulatory frameworks, water pricing, and incentives are needed to better allocate, regulate, and conserve water resources.

The roughly 1 billion people living in monsoonal basins and the 500 million people living in deltas are especially vulnerable.\u00a0 Flood damages are estimated around $120 billion per year (only from property damage), and droughts pose, among others, constraints to the rural poor, highly dependent on rainfall variability for subsistence.\u00a0\n\nThe fragmentation of this resource also constrains water security. There are 276 transboundary basins, shared by 148 countries, which account for 60% of the global freshwater flow. Similarly, 300 aquifers systems are transboundary in nature, with 2.5 billion people worldwide are dependent on groundwater. The challenges of fragmentation are often replicated at the national scale, meaning cooperation is needed to achieve optimal water resources management and development solutions for all riparians. To deal with these complex and interlinked water challenges, countries will need to improve the way they manage their water resources and associated services.\n\nTo strengthen water security against this backdrop of increasing demand, water scarcity, growing uncertainty, greater extremes, and fragmentation challenges, clients will need to invest in institutional strengthening, information management, and (natural and man-made) infrastructure development. Institutional tools such as legal and regulatory frameworks, water pricing, and incentives are needed to better allocate, regulate, and conserve water resources.

The SDGs provide an opportunity for the World Bank Group and development partners to work together in support of this vision.\n\nAnd, in 2019, the Water GP launched its new Strategic Action Plan. Our vision remains a Water Secure World for All, to be delivered through three inter-related pillars: (1)\u00a0sustain water resources, (2)\u00a0deliver services, and (3)\u00a0build resilience. The World Bank has played a key role in driving delivery when it comes to the SDGs. We continue to implement programs and projects across the world, convene a wide range of actors to achieve cross-sectoral solutions, and share our data, knowledge and know-how with others in service of a water-secure world for all.\n\nWith a portfolio of water investments of almost US$30 billion and a staff of hundreds of water experts across the world, the Water GP is uniquely positioned to address these themes, developing and sharing global knowledge while amplifying the impact of lending through technical assistance on the ground.\n\nThe World Bank has identified five priority themes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal in the water sector (SDG 6). To address the challenges of increasing water scarcity and variability and to ensure that results are maintained in the future, a renewed focus on the multiple facets of resilience and sustainability is needed. However, without new efforts to improve inclusion, many will still be unable to reap the benefits of water and will be disproportionately impacted by water-related disasters.\n\nHelping countries achieve greater sustainability and inclusion in the water sector requires investment in institutions, to complement the traditional focus on building infrastructure. Building the institutions and infrastructure needed for universal access and more sustainable water management practices also demands a vast increase in financing for the water sector, which can only be achieved by improving financial viability and leveraging donor funding to tap other sources of finance.\n\nThese five priority themes form the core of a partnership for a water-secure world, supported by the \u3010340\u2020Global Water Security &amp; Sanitation Partnership (GWSP)\u3011. This is a Multi-Donor Trust Fund, launched in 2017 that enables the Water GP to address the five themes across its global portfolio.\n\nTo more effectively bring critical resources to the front lines, the GWSP has been designed as a Water GP core asset\u2014its \u201cthink-tank\u201d\u2014which expands and deepens the impact of its lending program.\n\nIn 2018, the \u3010341\u20202030 Water Resources Group (2030 WRG)\u2020www.2030wrg.org\u3011\u00a0\u2014 a public-private-civil society partnership \u2014 became part of the Water GP family. 2030 WRG supports government-accelerated reforms with the aim of ensuring sustainable water resources management for long-term development and economic growth.\n\nTo respond to COVID-19, action in the WASH sector is critical for both containing the virus and lowering its immediate impact and aftermath.

During an infectious disease outbreak, services should meet minimum quality standards and should be separated for infected vs. non-infected patients. Support should ensure services are not disrupted and products such as soap and alcohol-based hand rubs are available. These services should also be available in temporary HCFs and quarantine sites.\u00a0\n\n  2. [Image 9: Sign Language]Improving handwashing behavior, food hygiene, and safe water practices.

As of 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, 3.5 billion lacked access to safely managed sanitation, and 2 billion lacked access to basic hand hygiene facilities. Today, global investment needs in the water sector exceed $1.37 trillion. To meet SDG 6 by 2030, investments must increase sixfold from the current level. Scaling up water investments will result in healthier people and ecosystems, climate-resilient irrigation and drainage services for farmers and improved water storage. In fiscal year 2023, the World Bank saw increased demand from client countries for assistance in building effective and efficient institutions for delivery of water and sanitation services, achieving climate-resilient irrigation, and managing worsening flood and drought risks. GWSP provided support for designing and implementing projects that are sustainable and resilient as well as inclusive policy advice. Over the past year, GWSP informed more than $13.5 billion of World Bank projects.

As of 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, 3.5 billion lacked access to safely managed sanitation, and 2 billion lacked access to basic hand hygiene facilities. Today, global investment needs in the water sector exceed $1.37 trillion. To meet SDG 6 by 2030, investments must increase sixfold from the current level. Scaling up water investments will result in healthier people and ecosystems, climate-resilient irrigation and drainage services for farmers and improved water storage. In fiscal year 2023, the World Bank saw increased demand from client countries for assistance in building effective and efficient institutions for delivery of water and sanitation services, achieving climate-resilient irrigation, and managing worsening flood and drought risks. GWSP provided support for designing and implementing projects that are sustainable and resilient as well as inclusive policy advice. Over the past year, GWSP informed more than $13.5 billion of World Bank projects.

By 2030, the world could face a 40% shortfall between forecasted demand and available water supply\u30108\u2020source\u3011\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Water Use**:\n   - Agriculture consumes 70% of global freshwater resources, with this percentage rising to 90% in low-income countries. Industrial and domestic uses account for the remaining water withdrawals\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n   - Between 1960 and 2018, global water withdrawals increased by 100% in agriculture, 90% in industry, and 300% in domestic use\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Impact of Climate Change**:\n   - Climate change is exacerbating water scarcity by altering hydrological cycles, leading to more frequent and intense floods and droughts. This affects approximately 1 billion people living in monsoonal basins and 500 million in deltas\u30108\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Transboundary Water Management**:\n   - There are 276 transboundary river basins worldwide, shared by 148 countries, accounting for 60% of global freshwater flow. Effective management of these resources requires international cooperation\u30108\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Relevance of the Water Bottling Industry\n\n1. **Economic Impact**:\n   - The bottled water industry is a significant economic sector, contributing to local economies through production, sales, and distribution. It provides numerous jobs and stimulates related industries\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **Environmental Concerns**:\n   - The industry faces criticism for its environmental impact, particularly regarding plastic waste and the carbon footprint associated with production and transportation. Efforts are underway to promote sustainable practices, including recycling and reducing plastic use\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Water Extraction**:\n   - Bottling companies often extract large quantities of groundwater, which can lead to the depletion of local water resources, affecting communities and ecosystems\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Regulation and Sustainability**:\n   - Increasing regulatory pressures and consumer demand for sustainability are driving the industry towards more environmentally friendly practices. This includes adopting better water management techniques and investing in infrastructure to reduce the environmental impact\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Key Statistics\n\n- **Population Affected by Water Issues**:\n  - 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water.\n  - 3.5 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation.\n  - 2 billion people lack basic hygiene services\u301012\u2020source\u3011.\n\n- **Economic Investments**:\n  - Global investment needs in the water sector exceed $1.37 trillion to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6) by 2030. Current investment levels need to increase sixfold to achieve these goals\u301012\u2020source\u3011.\n\nFor more detailed data and reports, you can visit the [World Bank Water Resources Management](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water) page and the [Global Water Security and Sanitation Partnership Annual Report 2023](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/gwsp-annual-report-2023)."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Water-related disasters account for 70% of all deaths related to natural disasters. The World Bank helps countries ensure sustainability of water use, build climate resilience and strengthen integrated management.\n\n  * Context &amp; Challenges\n  * Strategy\n  * Results &amp; Initiatives\n\nToday, most countries are placing unprecedented pressure on water resources. The global population is growing fast, and estimates show that with current practices, the world will face a 40% shortfall between forecast demand and available supply of water by 2030. Furthermore, chronic water scarcity, hydrological uncertainty, and extreme weather events (floods and droughts) are perceived as some of the biggest threats to global prosperity and stability. Acknowledgment of the role that water scarcity and drought are playing in aggravating fragility and conflict is increasing.\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020View the Full Infographic&gt;&gt;\u3011\n\nFeeding \u3010331\u202010 billion people by 2050 will require a 50% increase in agricultural production\u2020www.unwater.org\u3011, (which consumes 70% of the resource today), and a 15%\u00a0increase in water withdrawals. Besides this increasing demand, the resource is already scarce in many parts of the world. Estimates indicate that over 40% of the world population live in water scarce areas, and approximately \u00bc of world\u2019s GDP is exposed to this challenge. \u3010332\u2020By 2040, an estimated one in four children will live in areas with extreme water shortages\u2020mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms\u3011.\u00a0Water security is a major \u2013 and often growing \u2013challenge for many countries today.\n\nClimate change will worsen the situation by altering hydrological cycles, making water more unpredictable and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. The roughly 1 billion people living in monsoonal basins and the 500 million people living in deltas are especially vulnerable.\u00a0 Flood damages are estimated around $120 billion per year (only from property damage), and droughts pose, among others, constraints to the rural poor, highly dependent on rainfall variability for subsistence.\u00a0\n\nThe fragmentation of this resource also constrains water security. There are 276 transboundary basins, shared by 148 countries, which account for 60% of the global freshwater flow. Similarly, 300 aquifers systems are transboundary in nature, with 2.5 billion people worldwide are dependent on groundwater. The challenges of fragmentation are often replicated at the national scale, meaning cooperation is needed to achieve optimal water resources management and development solutions for all riparians. To deal with these complex and interlinked water challenges, countries will need to improve the way they manage their water resources and associated services.\n\nTo strengthen water security against this backdrop of increasing demand, water scarcity, growing uncertainty, greater extremes, and fragmentation challenges, clients will need to invest in institutional strengthening, information management, and (natural and man-made) infrastructure development. Institutional tools such as legal and regulatory frameworks, water pricing, and incentives are needed to better allocate, regulate, and conserve water resources.

Population growth naturally leads to more pressure on water resources, as illustrated by the correlation between population size and water withdrawals.\n\nWhile that correlation holds at the global level, there is significant variation from country to country.\n\nIn Uruguay for instance, water withdrawals have increased much faster than the population. This is partly explained by Uruguay\u2019s agricultural sector\u2019s specialization in water intensive products like beef, soybeans, and rice.\n\nIn contrast, owing to more efficient use of water resources, the United States has managed to withdraw less water over the same period of time, despite of a growing population.\n\nSource: [link: http://fao.org/aquastat/statistics/query/index.html?lang=en FAO Aquastat database].

Water-related disasters account for 70% of all deaths related to natural disasters. The World Bank helps countries ensure sustainability of water use, build climate resilience and strengthen integrated management.\n\n  * Context &amp; Challenges\n  * Strategy\n  * Results &amp; Initiatives\n\nToday, most countries are placing unprecedented pressure on water resources. The global population is growing fast, and estimates show that with current practices, the world will face a 40% shortfall between forecast demand and available supply of water by 2030. Furthermore, chronic water scarcity, hydrological uncertainty, and extreme weather events (floods and droughts) are perceived as some of the biggest threats to global prosperity and stability. Acknowledgment of the role that water scarcity and drought are playing in aggravating fragility and conflict is increasing.\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020View the Full Infographic&gt;&gt;\u3011\n\nFeeding \u3010331\u202010 billion people by 2050 will require a 50% increase in agricultural production\u2020www.unwater.org\u3011, (which consumes 70% of the resource today), and a 15%\u00a0increase in water withdrawals. Besides this increasing demand, the resource is already scarce in many parts of the world. Estimates indicate that over 40% of the world population live in water scarce areas, and approximately \u00bc of world\u2019s GDP is exposed to this challenge. \u3010332\u2020By 2040, an estimated one in four children will live in areas with extreme water shortages\u2020mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms\u3011.\u00a0Water security is a major \u2013 and often growing \u2013challenge for many countries today.\n\nClimate change will worsen the situation by altering hydrological cycles, making water more unpredictable and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. The roughly 1 billion people living in monsoonal basins and the 500 million people living in deltas are especially vulnerable.\u00a0 Flood damages are estimated around $120 billion per year (only from property damage), and droughts pose, among others, constraints to the rural poor, highly dependent on rainfall variability for subsistence.\u00a0\n\nThe fragmentation of this resource also constrains water security. There are 276 transboundary basins, shared by 148 countries, which account for 60% of the global freshwater flow. Similarly, 300 aquifers systems are transboundary in nature, with 2.5 billion people worldwide are dependent on groundwater. The challenges of fragmentation are often replicated at the national scale, meaning cooperation is needed to achieve optimal water resources management and development solutions for all riparians.

Water-related disasters account for 70% of all deaths related to natural disasters. The World Bank helps countries ensure sustainability of water use, build climate resilience and strengthen integrated management.\n\n  * Context &amp; Challenges\n  * Strategy\n  * Results &amp; Initiatives\n\nToday, most countries are placing unprecedented pressure on water resources. The global population is growing fast, and estimates show that with current practices, the world will face a 40% shortfall between forecast demand and available supply of water by 2030. Furthermore, chronic water scarcity, hydrological uncertainty, and extreme weather events (floods and droughts) are perceived as some of the biggest threats to global prosperity and stability. Acknowledgment of the role that water scarcity and drought are playing in aggravating fragility and conflict is increasing.\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020View the Full Infographic&gt;&gt;\u3011\n\nFeeding \u3010331\u202010 billion people by 2050 will require a 50% increase in agricultural production\u2020www.unwater.org\u3011, (which consumes 70% of the resource today), and a 15%\u00a0increase in water withdrawals. Besides this increasing demand, the resource is already scarce in many parts of the world. Estimates indicate that over 40% of the world population live in water scarce areas, and approximately \u00bc of world\u2019s GDP is exposed to this challenge. \u3010332\u2020By 2040, an estimated one in four children will live in areas with extreme water shortages\u2020mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms\u3011.\u00a0Water security is a major \u2013 and often growing \u2013challenge for many countries today.\n\nClimate change will worsen the situation by altering hydrological cycles, making water more unpredictable and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. The roughly 1 billion people living in monsoonal basins and the 500 million people living in deltas are especially vulnerable.\u00a0 Flood damages are estimated around $120 billion per year (only from property damage), and droughts pose, among others, constraints to the rural poor, highly dependent on rainfall variability for subsistence.\u00a0\n\nThe fragmentation of this resource also constrains water security. There are 276 transboundary basins, shared by 148 countries, which account for 60% of the global freshwater flow. Similarly, 300 aquifers systems are transboundary in nature, with 2.5 billion people worldwide are dependent on groundwater. The challenges of fragmentation are often replicated at the national scale, meaning cooperation is needed to achieve optimal water resources management and development solutions for all riparians. To deal with these complex and interlinked water challenges, countries will need to improve the way they manage their water resources and associated services.\n\nTo strengthen water security against this backdrop of increasing demand, water scarcity, growing uncertainty, greater extremes, and fragmentation challenges, clients will need to invest in institutional strengthening, information management, and (natural and man-made) infrastructure development.

The SDGs provide an opportunity for the World Bank Group and development partners to work together in support of this vision.\n\nAnd, in 2019, the Water GP launched its new Strategic Action Plan. Our vision remains a Water Secure World for All, to be delivered through three inter-related pillars: (1)\u00a0sustain water resources, (2)\u00a0deliver services, and (3)\u00a0build resilience. The World Bank has played a key role in driving delivery when it comes to the SDGs. We continue to implement programs and projects across the world, convene a wide range of actors to achieve cross-sectoral solutions, and share our data, knowledge and know-how with others in service of a water-secure world for all.\n\nWith a portfolio of water investments of almost US$30 billion and a staff of hundreds of water experts across the world, the Water GP is uniquely positioned to address these themes, developing and sharing global knowledge while amplifying the impact of lending through technical assistance on the ground.\n\nThe World Bank has identified five priority themes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal in the water sector (SDG 6). To address the challenges of increasing water scarcity and variability and to ensure that results are maintained in the future, a renewed focus on the multiple facets of resilience and sustainability is needed. However, without new efforts to improve inclusion, many will still be unable to reap the benefits of water and will be disproportionately impacted by water-related disasters.\n\nHelping countries achieve greater sustainability and inclusion in the water sector requires investment in institutions, to complement the traditional focus on building infrastructure. Building the institutions and infrastructure needed for universal access and more sustainable water management practices also demands a vast increase in financing for the water sector, which can only be achieved by improving financial viability and leveraging donor funding to tap other sources of finance.\n\nThese five priority themes form the core of a partnership for a water-secure world, supported by the \u3010340\u2020Global Water Security &amp; Sanitation Partnership (GWSP)\u3011. This is a Multi-Donor Trust Fund, launched in 2017 that enables the Water GP to address the five themes across its global portfolio.\n\nTo more effectively bring critical resources to the front lines, the GWSP has been designed as a Water GP core asset\u2014its \u201cthink-tank\u201d\u2014which expands and deepens the impact of its lending program.\n\nIn 2018, the \u3010341\u20202030 Water Resources Group (2030 WRG)\u2020www.2030wrg.org\u3011\u00a0\u2014 a public-private-civil society partnership \u2014 became part of the Water GP family. 2030 WRG supports government-accelerated reforms with the aim of ensuring sustainable water resources management for long-term development and economic growth.\n\nTo respond to COVID-19, action in the WASH sector is critical for both containing the virus and lowering its immediate impact and aftermath. Three priority areas are identified as part of the emergency response:\n\n  1. [Image 8: Medical]Safe WASH services in health care facilities (HCFs) to deliver quality health services; protect patients, health workers, and staff; and to prevent further transmission.

During an infectious disease outbreak, services should meet minimum quality standards and should be separated for infected vs. non-infected patients. Support should ensure services are not disrupted and products such as soap and alcohol-based hand rubs are available. These services should also be available in temporary HCFs and quarantine sites.\u00a0\n\n  2. [Image 9: Sign Language]Improving handwashing behavior, food hygiene, and safe water practices.

The SDGs provide an opportunity for the World Bank Group and development partners to work together in support of this vision.\n\nAnd, in 2019, the Water GP launched its new Strategic Action Plan. Our vision remains a Water Secure World for All, to be delivered through three inter-related pillars: (1)\u00a0sustain water resources, (2)\u00a0deliver services, and (3)\u00a0build resilience. The World Bank has played a key role in driving delivery when it comes to the SDGs. We continue to implement programs and projects across the world, convene a wide range of actors to achieve cross-sectoral solutions, and share our data, knowledge and know-how with others in service of a water-secure world for all.\n\nWith a portfolio of water investments of almost US$30 billion and a staff of hundreds of water experts across the world, the Water GP is uniquely positioned to address these themes, developing and sharing global knowledge while amplifying the impact of lending through technical assistance on the ground.\n\nThe World Bank has identified five priority themes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal in the water sector (SDG 6). To address the challenges of increasing water scarcity and variability and to ensure that results are maintained in the future, a renewed focus on the multiple facets of resilience and sustainability is needed. However, without new efforts to improve inclusion, many will still be unable to reap the benefits of water and will be disproportionately impacted by water-related disasters.\n\nHelping countries achieve greater sustainability and inclusion in the water sector requires investment in institutions, to complement the traditional focus on building infrastructure. Building the institutions and infrastructure needed for universal access and more sustainable water management practices also demands a vast increase in financing for the water sector, which can only be achieved by improving financial viability and leveraging donor funding to tap other sources of finance.\n\nThese five priority themes form the core of a partnership for a water-secure world, supported by the \u3010340\u2020Global Water Security &amp; Sanitation Partnership (GWSP)\u3011. This is a Multi-Donor Trust Fund, launched in 2017 that enables the Water GP to address the five themes across its global portfolio.\n\nTo more effectively bring critical resources to the front lines, the GWSP has been designed as a Water GP core asset\u2014its \u201cthink-tank\u201d\u2014which expands and deepens the impact of its lending program.\n\nIn 2018, the \u3010341\u20202030 Water Resources Group (2030 WRG)\u2020www.2030wrg.org\u3011\u00a0\u2014 a public-private-civil society partnership \u2014 became part of the Water GP family. 2030 WRG supports government-accelerated reforms with the aim of ensuring sustainable water resources management for long-term development and economic growth.\n\nTo respond to COVID-19, action in the WASH sector is critical for both containing the virus and lowering its immediate impact and aftermath. Three priority areas are identified as part of the emergency response:\n\n  1. [Image 8: Medical]Safe WASH services in health care facilities (HCFs) to deliver quality health services; protect patients, health workers, and staff; and to prevent further transmission. The WASH in Health Care Facilities Global Baseline Report (JMP, 2019) highlighted that one in four HCFs lacks basic water service (affecting more than 900 million people), one in five HCFs has no sanitation service (affecting about 1.5 billion people), and one in six HCFs has no hygiene service. During an infectious disease outbreak, services should meet minimum quality standards and should be separated for infected vs. non-infected patients. Support should ensure services are not disrupted and products such as soap and alcohol-based hand rubs are available. These services should also be available in temporary HCFs and quarantine sites.\u00a0\n\n  2. [Image 9: Sign Language]Improving handwashing behavior, food hygiene, and safe water practices. Materials for handwashing and hygiene may include provision of fixed and portable handwashing facilities, purchase of soap and alcohol-based hand rubs, provision of water supplies for handwashing, and point of use water treatment. Schools, workplaces, markets, transport stations, and other areas where people gather all require easy access to handwashing facilities and water and soap for handwashing. Proven behavior change techniques can help increase the frequency and improve the practice of critical hygiene behaviors. Resources such as the\u00a0\u3010342\u2020Global Handwashing Partnership\u2020globalhandwashing.org\u3011\u00a0can be tapped to mobilize private, public, and civil society actors to support developing messaging and materials to respond to COVID-19 outbreaks in country.\u00a0\n\n  3. Emergency support to secure and extend water and sanitation service provision, including:\n\n  * [Image 10: Sink]Rapid and low-cost water service and sanitation provision for communities, health care facilities, and schools is critical to enable handwashing, hygiene, and disinfection.

As of 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, 3.5 billion lacked access to safely managed sanitation, and 2 billion lacked access to basic hand hygiene facilities. Today, global investment needs in the water sector exceed $1.37 trillion. To meet SDG 6 by 2030, investments must increase sixfold from the current level. Scaling up water investments will result in healthier people and ecosystems, climate-resilient irrigation and drainage services for farmers and improved water storage. In fiscal year 2023, the World Bank saw increased demand from client countries for assistance in building effective and efficient institutions for delivery of water and sanitation services, achieving climate-resilient irrigation, and managing worsening flood and drought risks.

Water-related disasters account for 70% of all deaths related to natural disasters. The World Bank helps countries ensure sustainability of water use, build climate resilience and strengthen integrated management.\n\n  * Context &amp; Challenges\n  * Strategy\n  * Results &amp; Initiatives\n\nToday, most countries are placing unprecedented pressure on water resources. The global population is growing fast, and estimates show that with current practices, the world will face a 40% shortfall between forecast demand and available supply of water by 2030. Furthermore, chronic water scarcity, hydrological uncertainty, and extreme weather events (floods and droughts) are perceived as some of the biggest threats to global prosperity and stability. Acknowledgment of the role that water scarcity and drought are playing in aggravating fragility and conflict is increasing.\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u3010330\u2020View the Full Infographic&gt;&gt;\u3011\n\nFeeding \u3010331\u202010 billion people by 2050 will require a 50% increase in agricultural production\u2020www.unwater.org\u3011, (which consumes 70% of the resource today), and a 15%\u00a0increase in water withdrawals. Besides this increasing demand, the resource is already scarce in many parts of the world. Estimates indicate that over 40% of the world population live in water scarce areas, and approximately \u00bc of world\u2019s GDP is exposed to this challenge. \u3010332\u2020By 2040, an estimated one in four children will live in areas with extreme water shortages\u2020mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms\u3011.\u00a0Water security is a major \u2013 and often growing \u2013challenge for many countries today.\n\nClimate change will worsen the situation by altering hydrological cycles, making water more unpredictable and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. The roughly 1 billion people living in monsoonal basins and the 500 million people living in deltas are especially vulnerable.\u00a0 Flood damages are estimated around $120 billion per year (only from property damage), and droughts pose, among others, constraints to the rural poor, highly dependent on rainfall variability for subsistence.\u00a0\n\nThe fragmentation of this resource also constrains water security. There are 276 transboundary basins, shared by 148 countries, which account for 60% of the global freshwater flow. Similarly, 300 aquifers systems are transboundary in nature, with 2.5 billion people worldwide are dependent on groundwater. The challenges of fragmentation are often replicated at the national scale, meaning cooperation is needed to achieve optimal water resources management and development solutions for all riparians. To deal with these complex and interlinked water challenges, countries will need to improve the way they manage their water resources and associated services.\n\nTo strengthen water security against this backdrop of increasing demand, water scarcity, growing uncertainty, greater extremes, and fragmentation challenges, clients will need to invest in institutional strengthening, information management, and (natural and man-made) infrastructure development. Institutional tools such as legal and regulatory frameworks, water pricing, and incentives are needed to better allocate, regulate, and conserve water resources. Information systems are needed for resource monitoring, decision making under unce"}, {"matched_text": "\u301010\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 327, "end_idx": 338, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "Clean water &amp; sanitation | SDG 6: Clean water &amp; sanitation", "url": "https://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgatlas/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\n# Water withdrawal has increased in many countries\n\n## Total freshwater withdrawal (billion m^{3}/year) and Total population\n\n[Image 8: Loading] \n\n\u301020\u2020Data\u3011 Image Copy Link\n\nSource: [link: http://fao.org/aquastat/statistics/query/index.html?lang=en FAO Aquastat database].

The World Bank has played a key role in driving delivery when it comes to the SDGs. We continue to implement programs and projects across the world, convene a wide range of actors to achieve cross-sectoral solutions, and share our data, knowledge and know-how with others in service of a water-secure world for all.\n\nWith a portfolio of water investments of almost US$30 billion and a staff of hundreds of water experts across the world, the Water GP is uniquely positioned to address these themes, developing and sharing global knowledge while amplifying the impact of lending through technical assistance on the ground.\n\nThe World Bank has identified five priority themes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal in the water sector (SDG 6). To address the challenges of increasing water scarcity and variability and to ensure that results are maintained in the future, a renewed focus on the multiple facets of resilience and sustainability is needed. However, without new efforts to improve inclusion, many will still be unable to reap the benefits of water and will be disproportionately impacted by water-related disasters.\n\nHelping countries achieve greater sustainability and inclusion in the water sector requires investment in institutions, to complement the traditional focus on building infrastructure. Building the institutions and infrastructure needed for universal access and more sustainable water management practices also demands a vast increase in financing for the water sector, which can only be achieved by improving financial viability and leveraging donor funding to tap other sources of finance.\n\nThese five priority themes form the core of a partnership for a water-secure world, supported by the \u3010340\u2020Global Water Security &amp; Sanitation Partnership (GWSP)\u3011.

Three priority areas are identified as part of the emergency response:\n\n  1. [Image 8: Medical]Safe WASH services in health care facilities (HCFs) to deliver quality health services; protect patients, health workers, and staff; and to prevent further transmission. The WASH in Health Care Facilities Global Baseline Report (JMP, 2019) highlighted that one in four HCFs lacks basic water service (affecting more than 900 million people), one in five HCFs has no sanitation service (affecting about 1.5 billion people), and one in six HCFs has no hygiene service. During an infectious disease outbreak, services should meet minimum quality standards and should be separated for infected vs. non-infected patients. Support should ensure services are not disrupted and products such as soap and alcohol-based hand rubs are available. These services should also be available in temporary HCFs and quarantine sites.\u00a0\n\n  2. [Image 9: Sign Language]Improving handwashing behavior, food hygiene, and safe water practices. Materials for handwashing and hygiene may include provision of fixed and portable handwashing facilities, purchase of soap and alcohol-based hand rubs, provision of water supplies for handwashing, and point of use water treatment. Schools, workplaces, markets, transport stations, and other areas where people gather all require easy access to handwashing facilities and water and soap for handwashing. Proven behavior change techniques can help increase the frequency and improve the practice of critical hygiene behaviors. Resources such as the\u00a0\u3010342\u2020Global Handwashing Partnership\u2020globalhandwashing.org\u3011\u00a0can be tapped to mobilize private, public, and civil society actors to support developing messaging and materials to respond to COVID-19 outbreaks in country.\u00a0\n\n  3.

During an infectious disease outbreak, services should meet minimum quality standards and should be separated for infected vs. non-infected patients. Support should ensure services are not disrupted and products such as soap and alcohol-based hand rubs are available. These services should also be available in temporary HCFs and quarantine sites.\u00a0\n\n  2. [Image 9: Sign Language]Improving handwashing behavior, food hygiene, and safe water practices.

As of 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, 3.5 billion lacked access to safely managed sanitation, and 2 billion lacked access to basic hand hygiene facilities. Today, global investment needs in the water sector exceed $1.37 trillion. To meet SDG 6 by 2030, investments must increase sixfold from the current level. Scaling up water investments will result in healthier people and ecosystems, climate-resilient irrigation and drainage services for farmers and improved water storage. In fiscal year 2023, the World Bank saw increased demand from client countries for assistance in building effective and efficient institutions for delivery of water and sanitation services, achieving climate-resilient irrigation, and managing worsening flood and drought risks. GWSP provided support for designing and implementing projects that are sustainable and resilient as well as inclusive policy advice. Over the past year, GWSP informed more than $13.5 billion of World Bank projects.

As of 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water, 3.5 billion lacked access to safely managed sanitation, and 2 billion lacked access to basic hand hygiene facilities. Today, global investment needs in the water sector exceed $1.37 trillion. To meet SDG 6 by 2030, investments must increase sixfold from the current level. Scaling up water investments will result in healthier people and ecosystems, climate-resilient irrigation and drainage services for farmers and improved water storage. In fiscal year 2023, the World Bank saw increased demand from client countries for assistance in building effective and efficient institutions for delivery of water and sanitation services, achieving climate-resilient irrigation, and managing worsening flood and drought risks. GWSP provided support for designing and implementing projects that are sustainable and resilient as well as inclusive policy advice. Over the past year, GWSP informed more than $13.5 billion of World Bank projects.

Although olive oil itself is a renewable resource derived from olives, the environmental, social, and economic impacts of its production processes can align well with the assignment criteria. Here are a few angles to consider:\n\n### Sustainability Issues in Olive Oil Production\n1. **Water Usage**: Olive cultivation, especially in regions like the Mediterranean, requires substantial water resources, which can be problematic in water-scarce areas.\n2. **Land Use and Deforestation**: Intensive farming practices for olive production can lead to land degradation, loss of biodiversity, and deforestation.\n3. **Chemical Use**: The use of pesticides and fertilizers in olive farming can have detrimental effects on the soil quality and surrounding ecosystems.\n4. **Energy Consumption**: The processes of harvesting, pressing, and bottling olive oil can be energy-intensive, often relying on non-renewable energy sources.\n\n### Economic, Social, and Environmental Consequences\n- **Local Communities**: Assess how olive oil production affects local economies, including impacts on employment and local businesses.\n- **Global Markets**: Consider the economic ramifications on a global scale, including export markets and price volatility.\n- **Environmental Impact**: Analyze the carbon footprint, effects on local wildlife, and broader ecological impacts.\n\n### Regulation and Sustainability Initiatives\n- **Organic and Sustainable Certification**: Explore how these certifications affect practices and perceptions in the olive oil industry.\n- **EU Regulations and Subsidies**: Discuss how European policies (for major producers like Spain, Italy, and Greece) support or hinder sustainable practices.\n- **Water Management Policies**: Assess the role of local and regional water management policies in sustainable olive cultivation.\n\n### Conceptual and Analytical Frameworks\n- **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**: Conduct or review an LCA for olive oil to identify major environmental hotspots throughout the product&#x27;s life cycle.\n- **SWOT Analysis**: A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis can help frame the economic and environmental aspects of olive oil production.\n\n### Presentation and Argument\nYour paper should culminate in a series of well-considered recommendations for improving sustainability within the industry.

Extra virgin olive oil, as a product of olives, technically comes from a renewable source \u2014 the olive trees. The key issues in its production tend to revolve around sustainable agricultural practices rather than the extraction of non-renewable resources.\n\n**Clarifying the Fit with the Assignment**:\n1. **Renewable vs. Non-renewable**: The assignment focuses on industries extracting non-renewable resources. Typical examples include mining, logging in non-managed forests, or fossil fuel extraction. These resources do not replenish within a human lifespan or are finite.\n\n2. **Sustainability Issues**: While the olive oil industry does face sustainability issues such as water use, land use, and impact on biodiversity, these concerns are rooted more in the realm of agricultural sustainability and management of renewable biological resources rather than non-renewable resource extraction.\n\n3. **Social Dilemma**: The social dilemmas in non-renewable resource industries typically arise from the resource&#x27;s depletion and the environmental degradation it causes, which impacts future generations&#x27; ability to utilize these resources. In contrast, the dilemmas in olive oil production are more about managing renewable resources responsibly to ensure long-term viability.\n\n**A More Suitable Topic**:\nConsidering the specifics of your assignment, focusing on an industry that extracts non-renewable resources would likely be more appropriate. Examples of more fitting topics could include:\n- **Coal Mining**: Issues include landscape degradation, water pollution, and air quality impacts, along with economic dependency of local communities on a dwindling resource.\n- **Overfishing**: Fits the model of exploiting a &quot;renewable&quot; resource in a non-renewable manner, leading to depletion of fish stocks, disruption of marine ecosystems, and impact on global food supply chains.\n- **Rare Earth Element (REE) Mining**: Critical for electronics and green technologies but associated with significant environmental contamination and geopolitical tensions due to concentrated supply chains.\n\nEach of these industries involves the extraction of resources in a manner that is either non-renewable or managed in unsustainable ways that mimic non-renewable extraction, thereby fitting the assignment&#x27;s description more accurately."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, it doesn&#x27;t directly align with the specific directive of the assignment, which asks for an analysis of a &quot;resource-extracting, non-renewable industry&quot; that creates social dilemmas through unsustainable practices.\n\nAI and robotics, as industries, generally involve technological innovation and manufacturing, which differ from traditional resource extraction like mining, logging, or fossil fuel extraction. These sectors are more about the creation and deployment of technology rather than the extraction of non-renewable natural resources. Here\u2019s how you might adjust or realign:\n\n### Adjusting the Focus to Fit the Assignment\nTo more closely align with the assignment\u2019s focus on non-renewable resource industries, consider industries where AI and robotics are applied and have significant environmental and social impacts. For instance:\n- **Mining and Automated Drilling**: These are classic examples of non-renewable resource extraction where AI and robotics are increasingly utilized. You could analyze how automation and robotics increase efficiency but also displace traditional jobs, potentially leading to local unemployment or social unrest, and how they enable faster resource depletion.\n- **Electronic Waste from Robotics**: If focusing more on the robotics industry, consider the life cycle of robots, which involves significant use of metals and rare earth elements that are non-renewable. The disposal of obsolete robots contributes to electronic waste, posing environmental and health hazards.\n\n### Suggested Structure for Impact Assessment\nIf you choose a more aligned topic within AI and robotics applications in a non-renewable resource context, here\u2019s how you might structure the paper:\n\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Briefly introduce the significance of AI and robotics in the chosen non-renewable industry (e.g., mining).\n   - State your thesis about how this integration impacts social structures, job displacement, and environmental sustainability.\n\n2. **Industry Overview**\n   - Describe how AI and robotics are used in the industry.\n   - Discuss the scale of the industry and its importance in global economic contexts.\n\n3. **Impact Assessment**\n   - **Social Impacts**: Analyze job displacement, changes in workforce skills requirements, and impacts on local communities.\n   - **Environmental Impacts**: Evaluate how AI and robotics might lead to faster depletion of non-renewable resources, or contribute to environmental degradation (e.g., increased waste).\n   - **Economic Impacts**: Discuss who benefits from the use of AI and robotics in the industry and how wealth is distributed.\n\n4. **Regulatory Frameworks**\n   - Review existing policies that regulate the use of technology in the industry.\n   - Discuss gaps in regulations that might allow unsustainable practices to proliferate.\n\n5. **Recommendations**\n   - Propose initiatives to mitigate negative impacts, such as retraining programs, stricter environmental regulations, or technology to reduce waste.\n   - Suggest policies to ensure more equitable benefits from technology use in the industry.\n\n6. **Conclusion**\n   - Summarize the main findings and reiterate the importance of sustainable practices in integrating AI and robotics into non-renewable industries.\n\n7. **References**\n   - List all sources in APA format.\n\nThis approach ensures your paper aligns with the assignment&#x27;s requirements while still allowing you to explore critical and contemporary issues related to technology, employment, and sustainability."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

There are several significant challenges to consider:\n\n1. **Economic Costs**: Although renewable energy costs have been decreasing, the initial investment for setting up renewable-powered desalination plants is still substantial. The infrastructure for capturing, converting, and storing renewable energy, along with the desalination equipment, requires significant capital investment. Additionally, operating and maintenance costs can be high.\n\n2. **Geographic Limitations**: Not all locations are suitable for renewable-powered desalination. For example, effective solar or wind-powered facilities require specific climatic conditions to operate efficiently. Similarly, regions far from coasts would face challenges in transporting desalinated water from coastal areas, adding to the costs and complexity.\n\n3. **Technological and Infrastructure Challenges**: Building the necessary infrastructure to distribute clean water from desalination plants to inland areas involves extensive and often expensive distribution systems. There&#x27;s also the need for technological advancements to increase efficiency and reduce costs further.\n\n4. **Environmental Concerns**: Despite the use of renewable energy, desalination has other environmental impacts. For instance, the intake and discharge involved in the process can harm marine ecosystems. Managing the highly concentrated brine discharge is a significant environmental challenge.\n\n5. **Political and Social Factors**: Water access is also influenced by political, administrative, and social factors. In some regions, political instability or poor governance can hinder the implementation and maintenance of water infrastructure. Water rights and access can also be a source of conflict.\n\n6. **Sustainability**: Over-reliance on desalination might shift focus away from other sustainable water management practices such as water conservation, recycling, and the protection of natural freshwater resources.\n\nIn summary, while technological and economic factors are crucial, addressing the global water crisis requires a multifaceted approach that includes technical, economic, environmental, and socio-political strategies. Ensuring every human has access to fresh, clean drinking water is as much about infrastructure and technology as it is about governance, policy, and community engagement."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

These costs include not only initial capital investment but also ongoing operational, maintenance, and infrastructure costs. Economies of scale may help reduce these costs over time, as technological advancements and increased adoption can lead to more efficient processes and cheaper materials.\n\n2. **Using Brine as Anti-Ice**: The idea of using brine from desalination as an anti-icing agent on roads is an interesting example of looking for productive uses of by-products. Brine is already used in some areas for road deicing because of its lower freezing point compared to water. However, the brine produced by desalination is typically much saltier than the brine currently used on roads, which might pose environmental challenges such as increased soil salinity and potential harm to wildlife and vegetation. Research into appropriate dilution and the environmental impacts would be necessary.\n\n3. **Financial Influences on Environmental and Sustainability Issues**: While financial considerations heavily influence environmental and sustainability issues, these are also separate categories because they involve non-financial factors such as ecological balance, biodiversity, and long-term viability of natural systems. Addressing these requires integrated approaches that balance economic, environmental, and social factors.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Solutions**: The idea of using desalination byproducts beneficially is part of a broader approach known as &#x27;circular economy,&#x27; which aims to minimize waste and make the most of resources. Such approaches can help mitigate some of the environmental impacts of desalination and make the processes more sustainable.\n\nUltimately, the financial aspects are indeed significant, but they are intertwined with technical, environmental, and social issues. Addressing the global water crisis effectively will likely require not only overcoming economic hurdles but also innovating in ways that minimize environmental impact and are socially and politically feasible. Collaborative international efforts, increased funding for research and development, public-private partnerships, and policy frameworks that encourage sustainable practices are all crucial components of a holistic approach to this challenge."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Proponents of cooperative or communal management systems argue that such frameworks can potentially address many global and social issues more effectively by prioritizing shared well-being over individual profit. Here are a few aspects to consider regarding this perspective:\n\n1. **Resource Distribution**: In a cooperative system, resources would be distributed based on need rather than the ability to pay. This could potentially ensure more equitable access to essentials like water, food, healthcare, and education.\n\n2. **Environmental Sustainability**: Cooperative management might prioritize long-term environmental sustainability over short-term gains. This could lead to more responsible use of resources, reducing environmental degradation and promoting the preservation of ecosystems for future generations.\n\n3. **Reduction in Inequality**: Without the profit motive, disparities in wealth and power could be reduced, potentially leading to a more egalitarian society. This could also decrease social tensions and increase societal stability.\n\n4. **Collaborative Innovation and Problem-Solving**: With resources and knowledge shared openly rather than guarded for competitive advantage, innovation could become more collaborative and occur at a faster pace.\n\n5. **Governance and Participation**: In a cooperative system, governance could become more participatory, with decisions made through democratic processes that involve all stakeholders. This could lead to policies that more accurately reflect the desires and needs of the population.\n\nHowever, there are significant challenges and critiques associated with implementing such a system globally:\n\n- **Economic Efficiency and Motivation**: Critics argue that without the incentives provided by the market system, such as profits and competition, there might be less motivation for innovation and efficiency. Determining how to motivate individuals and organizations to perform at their best without these incentives remains a challenge.\n\n- **Resource Allocation**: Deciding how to allocate resources fairly and effectively without a pricing mechanism could be complex. There needs to be a robust system to assess needs and distribute resources without bias or favoritism.\n\n- **Implementation and Transition**: Transitioning from a market-based system to a cooperative one involves profound changes not only in economics but also in cultural values and social structures. Such a transition could be tumultuous and fraught with conflict.\n\n- **Governance Complexity**: In practice, managing all global resources cooperatively would require unprecedented levels of cooperation and trust among all nations and cultures, which could be challenging to achieve and sustain.\n\nWhile cooperative management of the Earth\u2019s resources offers a compelling vision of a more equitable and sustainable future, it also poses significant theoretical and practical challenges.

This perspective is often discussed in terms of historical context, social conditioning, and the potential for change.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nHistorically, people often accepted their societal roles because they were deeply integrated into their cultural, religious, and social frameworks. This acceptance was influenced by limited exposure to alternatives and the prevailing belief systems that endorsed such hierarchies as natural or divinely ordained. In many societies, change began when these belief systems were questioned, whether through exposure to new ideas, economic shifts, or technological advancements.\n\n### Shifts in Perspective\n\nYour point about shifting motivations in a non-capitalist society suggests that if people&#x27;s basic needs are guaranteed, their motivations might shift from survival and personal gain towards self-actualization and societal well-being. This aligns with psychological theories like Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, which posits that once basic needs are met, individuals are more likely to pursue higher-order needs such as esteem and self-actualization.\n\n### Incentives in Non-Capitalist Societies\n\n1. **Individual Benefit**: Even in a society where wealth is not the primary motivator, individuals can find fulfillment in mastery of their work, recognition from their peers, and the intrinsic satisfaction of contributing to the community. These can be powerful motivators.\n\n2. **Societal Benefit**: In a cooperative system, the societal benefit is often more directly visible to the individual. If people see that their contributions lead to tangible improvements in their community, this visibility can reinforce their motivation to contribute meaningfully.\n\n3. **Education and Cultural Shifts**: Education can play a critical role in shifting perspectives from individualistic to more communal values. Cultivating a culture that values collaboration, sustainability, and community welfare could foster an environment where people are motivated by contributing to the greater good.\n\n### Challenges\n\nDespite these potential benefits, the challenges of implementing such a system on a large scale are significant. They include ensuring fair distribution, maintaining efficient productivity without traditional capitalist incentives, and managing diverse human desires and aspirations. Societal structures would need to evolve to support these new values, which would likely require significant changes in governance, legal frameworks, and cultural norms.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are historical precedents for people accepting less than optimal living conditions, the shift towards a society where both individual and communal benefits are valued equally could potentially lead to higher levels of satisfaction and fulfillment.

Using AI and robotics in ways that prioritize communal benefit over individual profit is an intriguing idea and could indeed help mitigate many of the potential negative impacts of these technologies, such as exacerbating income inequality.\n\n### Potential Benefits of Technological Advancements in a Cooperative Society\n\n1. **Automating Labor-Intensive Work**: Robots and AI can perform repetitive, labor-intensive tasks, freeing humans to engage in more creative, fulfilling, and socially beneficial activities. This could lead to a more engaged and contented society if managed properly.\n\n2. **Improving Resource Management**: AI can optimize the use of resources in production, distribution, and consumption, reducing waste and ensuring that resources are distributed according to need rather than economic power.\n\n3. **Enhancing Education and Healthcare**: AI and robotics can transform education and healthcare, providing personalized learning and medical treatment that could be universally accessible, significantly improving quality of life.\n\n4. **Creating New Economic Models**: With the automation of many jobs, traditional economic models based on labor for income might become outdated. This could spur the development of new models such as a universal basic income, where the wealth generated by AI and robotic labor is distributed to ensure that everyone\u2019s basic needs are met.\n\n### Challenges and Considerations\n\n1. **Managing Technological Displacement**: As AI and robotics take over more jobs, managing the displacement of workers will be a crucial challenge. Training and retraining programs, along with new job creation in sectors that AI cannot easily replicate, such as in the arts, human services, and other creative industries, will be vital.\n\n2. **Ensuring Equity in Technology Access**: Ensuring that AI and robotics technologies are used for the benefit of all, rather than creating further divisions, requires careful regulation and governance. Policies need to ensure that these technologies do not solely benefit a wealthy elite.\n\n3. **Ethical and Social Implications**: There are significant ethical considerations in how AI is programmed and used. Decisions made by AI systems can have profound effects on individuals and communities, so embedding ethical considerations into AI development is essential.\n\n4. **Cultural Shifts**: Adopting a technology-driven cooperative society would require significant cultural shifts. People would need to see themselves as part of a larger community where individual success is linked to the collective well-being.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nTo achieve the future you envision, it\u2019s crucial to have proactive governance that can anticipate and manage the changes brought by AI and robotics. This involves not only technological and economic adjustments but also ethical and cultural adaptations. Education will play a key role in preparing future generations for this shift, emphasizing cooperative skills, ethical technology use, and the stewardship of shared resources.\n\nBy aligning technological advancements with the goal of a sustainable, equitable society, there is indeed the potential to achieve remarkable things, reducing disparities and improving quality of life on a broad scale."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

While there are products that claim to help prevent the formation of tartar or reduce plaque, fully dissolving existing tartar typically requires professional dental cleaning. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what is available:\n\n### Prevention and Maintenance\n1. **Toothpaste and Mouthwash**: Many toothpastes and mouthwashes are formulated to help prevent the buildup of plaque and tartar. These often contain active ingredients such as:\n   - **Fluoride**: Strengthens tooth enamel and helps prevent decay.\n   - **Pyrophosphates and Zinc Citrate**: Help prevent the crystallization of plaque into tartar.\n   - **Triclosan**: An antibacterial agent that helps reduce plaque.\n\n2. **Whitening Products**: Some toothpastes and mouthwashes are designed to whiten teeth by removing surface stains, but they do not dissolve tartar. Common active ingredients include:\n   - **Hydrogen Peroxide or Carbamide Peroxide**: Bleaching agents that can help whiten teeth.\n   - **Baking Soda**: Mild abrasive that can help remove surface stains.\n\n### Tartar Removal\n1. **Home Remedies**: Some people use baking soda or vinegar as a home remedy to help reduce tartar. While these can help to some extent with plaque, they are not effective at dissolving hardened tartar and can be abrasive if not used properly.\n\n2. **Professional Dental Cleaning**: The most effective way to remove tartar is through professional dental cleaning. Dentists use special tools, such as ultrasonic scalers and hand instruments, to remove tartar from teeth and below the gum line.\n\n3. **Dental Tools for Home Use**: There are some dental tools available for home use that can help remove plaque and tartar, such as:\n   - **Dental Scalers**: Manual tools similar to those used by dentists, but they require skill and care to avoid damaging the gums.\n   - **Ultrasonic Cleaners**: Devices that use ultrasonic vibrations to help break up plaque and tartar, but their effectiveness can vary and they are not a substitute for professional cleaning.\n\n### Prevention of Periodontitis\nPreventing periodontitis involves maintaining good oral hygiene:\n- **Regular Brushing and Flossing**: Essential for removing plaque before it hardens into tartar.\n- **Regular Dental Check-ups**: Professional cleanings and check-ups help catch and manage issues early.\n- **Healthy Diet**: Reducing sugar intake and eating a balanced diet can help maintain oral health.\n\n### Conclusion\nThere is no product that can fully dissolve existing tartar at home. The best approach is prevention through good oral hygiene and regular professional dental cleanings.

When your blood sugar levels drop, your body may crave quick energy sources like sugar to feel energized immediately.\n\n2. **Mood Enhancement**: Consuming sugar leads to the release of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that boosts mood and provides a feeling of happiness and relaxation. This biochemical response can make sugar cravings particularly strong when you&#x27;re feeling low or stressed.\n\n3. **Habit and Conditioning**: If you regularly consume sweet foods, your body can become conditioned to crave sugar. This is also linked to the reward centers in your brain, which activate when you eat something pleasurable (like sugar), reinforcing the habit.\n\n4. **Dietary Patterns**: If your diet is irregular or you frequently miss meals, you might experience intense sugar cravings as your body seeks the fastest route to raise blood sugar levels.\n\n5. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Sometimes, cravings can indicate deficiencies in your diet. For example, a lack of certain nutrients like chromium, which helps regulate blood sugar, can increase sugar cravings.\n\nTo manage sugar cravings, it&#x27;s beneficial to maintain a balanced diet rich in whole foods, proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, which help stabilize blood sugar levels.

They work by using several specific features:\n\n1. **Electric Heating**: Smokeless grills are typically electric. They use a heating element to cook food instead of open flames or burning charcoal, which are major contributors to smoke production. The absence of combustion significantly reduces smoke.\n\n2. **Cooling Drip Trays**: One of the key innovations in smokeless grills is the use of a drip tray that stays cool during cooking. When fats and juices drip from the food, instead of landing on a hot surface and vaporizing into smoke, they hit this cooler surface. The cool drip tray often contains water to help cool the drippings quickly and prevent them from smoking.\n\n3. **Built-in Fans**: Some advanced models of smokeless grills include built-in fans or air filtration systems. These fans help to extract any smoke that does form, filtering it and circulating air to reduce the overall amount of smoke that escapes into the room.\n\n4. **Infrared Technology**: Some smokeless grills use infrared heating elements that cook food evenly while minimizing the overheating of fats and juices, thus reducing smoke. This technology can also help in cooking food more quickly, retaining more moisture, and evenly distributing heat.\n\n5. **Temperature Control**: Accurate temperature control helps in preventing overheating, which is another reason smoke might be generated. By keeping the temperature at an optimal level, smokeless grills ensure that food is cooked thoroughly without burning fats that create smoke.\n\nThese features make smokeless grills a convenient option for indoor grilling, allowing for a BBQ-style cooking experience without the usual smoke and fumes associated with traditional grilling methods."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This assertion suggested that perhaps olive oil is mislabeled or willfully misrepresented by manufacturers as olive oil when in reality they are some other cheaper more common oil like canola.  The video suggested a test to determine the authenticity of olive oil by refrigerating it to see if it remained in a liquid state a characteristic of genuine extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Intrigued by this I decided to investigate the claim myself focusing on my preferred brand Farchioni and investigating through the lens of authority and knowledge one might expect of Farchioni\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer. Given the high demand and available agricultural resources are the current levels of EVOO production sustainable?\nBackground of EVOO Production\nItaly stands out as a leading producer of olive oil reflecting a rich blend of tradition and modernity in its agricultural practices. This duality is embodied in every bottle of olive oil such as my 1-liter bottle of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) from Farchioni which I recently placed in the fridge to chill. As I waited to observe the results of my experiment I reflected on Farchioni\u2019s claims of harmoniously combining age-old techniques with contemporary methods to meet today&#x27;s sustainability standards (Sustainability n.d.). This integration helps maintain the ecological balance and ensures the survival of traditional practices cherished across generations.\nFarchioni a prominent figure in the olive oil market serves as a prime example of the successful integration of tradition and modernity in EVOO production. Their production process combines advanced machinery to enhance efficiency and reduce waste with traditional methods like hand-picking and first-cold-pressing(Sustainability n.d.) . These traditional methods are crucial for maintaining the distinct quality and authenticity of their EVOO setting a benchmark for sustainable production in the industry. Farchioni&#x27;s approach reflects a broader commitment across Italy to innovate while preserving the integrity of the olive oil heritage. \nAs the olive oil industry evolves regions like Umbria where Farchioni&#x27;s farms are located encounter their share of challenges. These include high operational costs and an aging workforce which necessitate further technological advancements. Modern tools like open-source spectrophotometers and AI are now being used to enhance traceability and ensure the purity of EVOO (Bayreuth n.d.; Violino et al. 2020). These technologies strengthen the &#x27;Made in Italy&#x27; label a crucial asset in the global marketplace and drive significant environmental improvements. For instance optimizing distribution and updating packaging materials are proposed to reduce the carbon footprint of EVOO production (Pisanelli et al. 2023) . This paints a picture of a future where tradition and innovation continue to merge ensuring the sustainability and authenticity of Italian olive oil on a global scale.\nSustainability Metrics and Indicator Analysis\nTo comprehensively assess the sustainability of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) production it is essential to consider a range of indicators that align with the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency substitution economic environmental social sustainability inter-generational equity and institutional sustainability. These principles can be measured using specific metrics such as material and energy intensity water consumption emission of toxic substances human health implications fair labor practices and the overall impact on the community. These metrics help in evaluating the breadth and depth of sustainability practices within the EVOO production process and are critical for making informed decisions aimed at improving sustainability outcomes over time (Maesano et al. 2021; Safeie-Noghlbari et al. 2024).\nIn the context of material intensity EVOO production demands significant resources particularly in packaging and equipment. Commonly used for oil bottling glass is energy-intensive to produce and contributes to higher CO2 emissions. This highlights the need for more sustainable packaging solutions such as recycled or lighter glass which could decrease material intensity and environmental impact(Maesano et al. 2021; Rinaldi et al. 2014; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo 2012). Similarly the metals used in processing equipment also require consideration particularly in terms of the energy and resources consumed during their manufacture and eventual recycling or disposal (Hansen 2022; Pisanelli et al. 2023; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo 2012)\nEnergy and water consumption are equally critical metrics. The operation of irrigation systems and processing facilities consumes substantial energy which can be mitigated by integrating renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power to reduce the carbon footprint of production processes (Allen et al. 1998; Hansen 2022; Rinaldi et al. 2014; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo 2012). Concerning water consumption olive cultivation particularly in drier regions necessitates significant water usage. Employing sustainable water management practices such as adopting drip irrigation systems can dramatically decrease water consumption preserving vital water resources. Additionally using pesticides and fertilizers in olive farming introduces toxic emissions and pollutants that can affect soil and water quality. Implementing organic farming practices and optimizing transportation and logistics can help minimize these environmental impacts (Ivic et al. 2021; Maesano et al. 2021).\nBeyond environmental considerations the human dimension of sustainability is pivotal. Protecting human health and safety in EVOO production involves minimizing workers&#x27; exposure to harmful chemicals ensuring proper safety training and providing adequate protective equipment (Connor &amp; Fereres 2010; Ncube et al. 2022). Furthermore adhering to labor laws and embracing fair trade practices are essential to guarantee fair wages and good working conditions for all employees. Finally the broader community impact of companies like Farchioni should be recognized as they often support local initiatives in education and healthcare contributing positively to the social fabric of their operating regions (Ncube et al. 2022). These efforts enhance community well-being and bolster the social sustainability of the business practices. By addressing these various sustainability indicators companies can comply with current standards and set new benchmarks for responsible production in the industry.\nSupply Chain Model\nThe supply chain for EVOO includes several stages: olive cultivation and harvesting processing and extraction packaging and storage and distribution and retail. Each stage presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. Improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the product&#x27;s overall sustainability (Maesano et al. 2021). Information Gaps and InferencesThere are notable gaps in available data particularly regarding comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production. Data on the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing is limited. However comparative analysis with similar agricultural products such as wine or almond production provides insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products show that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints (Gennaro &amp; Nardone 2014; Maesano et al. 2021).\nRole as Chief Sustainability Officer\nAs Farchioni\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer several measures can be prioritized to enhance sustainability in the company&#x27;s operations. These include enhancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use implementing sustainable water management practices improving waste management and reducing emissions and ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions. Progress can be measured by setting specific measurable goals conducting regular sustainability audits publicly reporting on sustainability performance engaging stakeholders and maintaining open communication about progress and challenges (Allen et al. 1998; Maesano et al. 2021; Safeie-Noghlbari et al. 2024; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo 2012).\nConclusion\nReflecting on the initial question of whether the levels of EVOO production are sustainable the answer is complex. Farchioni&#x27;s EVOO did not solidify in the refrigerator maintaining its same viscosity and overall physical properties indicating its authenticity (Bayreuth n.d.). However the sustainability of EVOO production can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use water consumption emissions and social impacts. Cooperative resource allocation systems emphasizing community involvement and fair practices are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry. By adopting these measures companies can contribute to a more sustainable future while maintaining the cultural and economic significance of EVOO production in Italy.\nReferences\nAllen R. G.

Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n### Adherence to Assignment Requirements\nThe paper clearly addresses the topic of sustainability in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) production. It begins with a personal anecdote to engage with the topic, then moves into detailed analyses across various aspects of sustainability (environmental, social, economic), using both the specific example of Farchioni and broader industry practices. This shows a comprehensive understanding of the subject, matching what would likely be required by an assignment on sustainability.\n\n### Quality and Depth of Analysis\nThe student presents a multi-faceted view of sustainability, considering:\n- **Environmental Impact**: Discussion of carbon footprint, energy and water use, and waste management.\n- **Social Impact**: Examination of labor practices and community involvement.\n- **Economic Impact**: Mention of operational efficiencies and cost considerations.\n\nThe analysis uses a variety of sources to back claims, indicating thorough research and an understanding of the topic&#x27;s complexity. This is a strong point in favor of the paper.\n\n### Clarity and Structure\nThe paper is well-organized, logically progressing from an introduction to detailed analysis, and finally to conclusions. Each section builds on the previous, with clear headings and concise, informative writing that maintains academic standards.\n\n### Originality and Insight\nThe personal experiment with refrigerating olive oil to test for authenticity adds an original element, showing initiative and a practical approach to the subject. This kind of personal engagement with the topic can demonstrate deeper learning and application, which are often highly valued in academic assessments.\n\n### Potential Errors or Misrepresentations\nThe claim regarding the refrigeration test for EVOO authenticity is indeed questionable. While it&#x27;s a popular myth, scientific sources suggest that this test is not a reliable indicator of olive oil purity. The fact that the oil remains liquid or solidifies at low temperatures can be influenced by various factors, not just whether it&#x27;s genuinely EVOO. The reliance on this test without adequate critical assessment or citation from authoritative sources on this specific claim could be seen as a significant error, potentially undermining the paper&#x27;s overall credibility.\n\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the paper demonstrates a solid understanding and analysis of the sustainability practices in olive oil production, especially highlighting the student\u2019s engagement with the topic through personal experimentation. However, the potential error in relying on a non-scientifically supported test for oil authenticity could be a point of contention.\n\nIf the grading rubric heavily penalizes factual inaccuracies or unscientific claims, this could prevent the paper from receiving full marks. A suggestion for improvement would be to address this error either by correcting the claim or by discussing its presence in public discourse critically, rather than endorsing it."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This paints a picture of a future where tradition and innovation continue to merge ensuring the sustainability and authenticity of Italian olive oil on a global scale.\nSustainability Metrics and Indicator Analysis\nTo comprehensively assess the sustainability of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) production it is essential to consider a range of indicators that align with the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency substitution economic environmental social sustainability inter-generational equity and institutional sustainability. These principles can be measured using specific metrics such as material and energy intensity water consumption emission of toxic substances human health implications fair labor practices and the overall impact on the community. These metrics help in evaluating the breadth and depth of sustainability practices within the EVOO production process and are critical for making informed decisions aimed at improving sustainability outcomes over time (Maesano et al. 2021; Safeie-Noghlbari et al. 2024).\nIn the context of material intensity EVOO production demands significant resources particularly in packaging and equipment. Commonly used for oil bottling glass is energy-intensive to produce and contributes to higher CO2 emissions. This highlights the need for more sustainable packaging solutions such as recycled or lighter glass which could decrease material intensity and environmental impact(Maesano et al. 2021; Rinaldi et al. 2014; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo 2012). Similarly the metals used in processing equipment also require consideration particularly in terms of the energy and resources consumed during their manufacture and eventual recycling or disposal (Hansen 2022; Pisanelli et al. 2023; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo 2012)\nEnergy and water consumption are equally critical metrics. The operation of irrigation systems and processing facilities consumes substantial energy which can be mitigated by integrating renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power to reduce the carbon footprint of production processes (Allen et al. 1998; Hansen 2022; Rinaldi et al. 2014; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo 2012). Concerning water consumption olive cultivation particularly in drier regions necessitates significant water usage. Employing sustainable water management practices such as adopting drip irrigation systems can dramatically decrease water consumption preserving vital water resources. Additionally using pesticides and fertilizers in olive farming introduces toxic emissions and pollutants that can affect soil and water quality. Implementing organic farming practices and optimizing transportation and logistics can help minimize these environmental impacts (Ivic et al. 2021; Maesano et al. 2021).\nBeyond environmental considerations the human dimension of sustainability is pivotal. Protecting human health and safety in EVOO production involves minimizing workers&#x27; exposure to harmful chemicals ensuring proper safety training and providing adequate protective equipment (Connor &amp; Fereres 2010; Ncube et al. 2022). Furthermore adhering to labor laws and embracing fair trade practices are essential to guarantee fair wages and good working conditions for all employees. Finally the broader community impact of companies like Farchioni should be recognized as they often support local initiatives in education and healthcare contributing positively to the social fabric of their operating regions (Ncube et al. 2022). These efforts enhance community well-being and bolster the social sustainability of the business practices. By addressing these various sustainability indicators companies can comply with current standards and set new benchmarks for responsible production in the industry.\nSupply Chain Model\nThe supply chain for EVOO includes several stages: olive cultivation and harvesting processing and extraction packaging and storage and distribution and retail. Each stage presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. Improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the product&#x27;s overall sustainability (Maesano et al. 2021). Information Gaps and InferencesThere are notable gaps in available data particularly regarding comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production. Data on the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing is limited. However comparative analysis with similar agricultural products such as wine or almond production provides insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products show that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints (Gennaro &amp; Nardone 2014; Maesano et al. 2021).\nRole as Chief Sustainability Officer\nAs Farchioni\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer several measures can be prioritized to enhance sustainability in the company&#x27;s operations. These include enhancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use implementing sustainable water management practices improving waste management and reducing emissions and ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions. Progress can be measured by setting specific measurable goals conducting regular sustainability audits publicly reporting on sustainability performance engaging stakeholders and maintaining open communication about progress and challenges (Allen et al. 1998; Maesano et al. 2021; Safeie-Noghlbari et al. 2024; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo 2012).\nConclusion\nReflecting on the initial question of whether the levels of EVOO production are sustainable the answer is complex. Farchioni&#x27;s EVOO did not solidify in the refrigerator maintaining its same viscosity and overall physical properties indicating its authenticity (Bayreuth n.d.). However the sustainability of EVOO production can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use water consumption emissions and social impacts. Cooperative resource allocation systems emphasizing community involvement and fair practices are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry. By adopting these measures companies can contribute to a more sustainable future while maintaining the cultural and economic significance of EVOO production in Italy.\nReferences\nAllen R. G.

To create a visual model of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) supply chain based on the description from the paper, we&#x27;ll proceed with the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Stages\nWe begin by clearly defining the four main stages mentioned in the narrative:\n\n1. **Olive Cultivation and Harvesting**: This is where the journey begins. The cultivation involves the agricultural practices employed to grow olive trees, including the selection of cultivars suited to the region&#x27;s climate and soil. Harvesting may vary from traditional hand-picking to more modern mechanical methods, depending on the scale and sustainability practices of the producer.\n\n2. **Processing and Extraction**: Once harvested, olives are transported to a processing facility. Here, olives are cleaned, crushed, and the oil is extracted. The method of extraction, especially if it involves cold pressing, is crucial as it influences the quality and flavor of the EVOO.\n\n3. **Packaging and Storage**: After extraction, the oil is stored in tanks and later bottled. Packaging materials (often glass or tin) and the conditions of storage (like temperature control) are pivotal for preserving the oil&#x27;s quality until it reaches consumers.\n\n4. **Distribution and Retail**: The final stage involves the logistics of distributing the oil to various retail outlets where it is sold to consumers. This stage also considers the environmental impact of transportation and the efficiency of the distribution network.\n\n### Step 2: Gather Visual Elements\nFor each stage, gather images or icons that represent each process. For instance:\n- **Olive Trees** for cultivation\n- **Oil Press** machine for extraction\n- **Bottles** for packaging\n- **Truck** for distribution\n\n### Step 3: Create the Flow Diagram\nUsing a diagramming tool (like Microsoft Visio, Google Drawings, or any online flowchart maker), start by placing the icons in a linear or circular flow to represent the progression from one stage to the next. Connect these icons with arrows to show the direction of the process flow, indicating how one stage feeds into the next.\n\n### Step 4: Add Descriptive Labels\nNext to each icon, add brief labels or bullet points that describe key activities or considerations for each stage:\n- For cultivation, mention the type of agricultural practices (e.g., organic, irrigated).\n- For extraction, note the method used (e.g., cold pressing).\n- For packaging, highlight the type of materials used and the reasons (e.g., glass to prevent oxidation).\n- For distribution, indicate the geographical scope and the mode of transportation.\n\n### Step 5: Highlight Sustainability Aspects\nGiven the focus of your paper, integrate visual cues or side notes that highlight sustainability measures at each stage. For example, you could use a green color code for activities that are particularly sustainable or add a leaf symbol next to practices that significantly reduce environmental impact.\n\n### Step 6: Review and Refine\nReview your diagram to ensure that it accurately represents the EVOO supply chain as described in the narrative. Check for clarity and readability, ensuring that the flow is logical and that the visual elements are not overcrowded. Adjust the layout, font sizes, and colors to enhance visual appeal and comprehension.\n\n### Step 7: Final Presentation\nOnce your visual supply chain model is complete, save it in a suitable format (like PNG or PDF) for easy inclusion in your paper or presentation. This visual model will not only complement the detailed narrative provided but also offer a quick, informative overview that enhances understanding of the supply chain&#x27;s complexity and sustainability.\n\nBy following these steps, you create not only a functional educational tool but also a visually appealing element that reinforces the sustainability themes discussed in your paper. This diagram will serve as a bridge, connecting theoretical concepts with real-world applications, making the overall presentation more engaging and effective."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

As my 1 liter bottle of  EVOO, made by renowned olive oil producer Farchioni, sat chilling in the fridge, I reflected on their blend of traditional and modern production methods (Statista, n.d.; Sustainability, n.d.). Farchioni\u2019s approach highlights both the potential and the challenges of sustainability. The Umbria region, known for its small-scale farms, faces high management costs and an aging farming population. Innovative approaches, such as fuzzy cognitive mapping, have been employed to address these challenges, focusing on sustainability and climate change adaptation (Pisanelli et al., 2023).\n\nModern technology, such as open-source spectrophotometers and artificial intelligence, enhances traceability and quality assurance, ensuring the authenticity of EVOO and protecting against fraud (Violino et al., 2020). These technologies support the &quot;Made in Italy&quot; brand, crucial for maintaining the market value of Italian EVOO. Studies have identified distribution and packaging as significant sources of environmental impact, suggesting improvements in transportation policies, lighter packaging materials, and renewable energy sources to reduce the carbon and energy footprints of EVOO (Ncube et al., 2022).\n\n\nThe passage above is  talking about many different subjects and not flowing between them neatly. There are thre distinct topics touched on in the first paragraph. Please create threee paragraphs of at least three sentences each that discusses each of the topics in turn and also flows neatly into  each other. \n\nthe three ideas: \n-Italy, a major producer of olive oil, exemplifies the complexities of maintaining sustainability in this industry\nFarchioni&#x27;s  blend of traditional and modern production methods (Statista, n.d.; Sustainability, n.d.)\nThe Umbria region, known for its small-scale farms, faces high management costs and an aging farming population  (Pisanelli et al., 2023).\n\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "88a1aeae9d1d59b9-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a44364cc-25b0-46a2-bf1c-12b12f123f06", "children": ["54a418a0-6c21-4633-a6e0-5e3f4950fac1"]}, "54a418a0-6c21-4633-a6e0-5e3f4950fac1": {"id": "54a418a0-6c21-4633-a6e0-5e3f4950fac1", "message": {"id": "54a418a0-6c21-4633-a6e0-5e3f4950fac1", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716767594.281814, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Italy is renowned globally as a major producer of olive oil, presenting a unique landscape of opportunities and challenges in sustainable agriculture.

Specific metrics include material intensity, energy intensity, water consumption, toxic emissions and pollutants, human health and safety, fair wages and working conditions, and community impact (Maesano et al., 2021).\n\n Analysis of Sustainability Indicators\n\nMaterial Intensity: EVOO production involves various materials, such as glass bottles for packaging and metal for processing equipment. Glass production is energy-intensive, contributing to CO2 emissions.\nEnergy Intensity: Significant energy consumption occurs in powering irrigation systems and processing facilities. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind can reduce the carbon footprint.\nWater Consumption: Olive cultivation requires substantial water, especially in arid regions. Sustainable water management practices, such as drip irrigation, can significantly reduce water usage.\nToxic Emissions and Pollutants: Pesticides and fertilizers used in olive farming can pollute soil and water. Emissions from transportation and processing contribute to air pollution. Organic farming practices and optimized logistics can mitigate these impacts.\nHuman Health and Safety: Exposure to chemicals and poor working conditions pose health risks to workers. It is crucial to ensure safe, non-toxic inputs and provide proper safety training and equipment.\nFair Wages and Working Conditions: Ensuring compliance with labor laws and supporting fair trade practices can improve workers&#x27; quality of life.\nCommunity Impact: Companies like Farchioni engage in social responsibility initiatives that benefit local communities, such as supporting education and healthcare (Armstrong, n.d.; Hansen, 2022; Maesano et al., 2021; Ncube et al., 2022; Salomone &amp; Ioppolo, 2012).\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "88a1d84048544be8-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "80aad827-0ccd-437d-9b94-5324ec2dc384", "children": ["b8a7413f-b95c-42a2-9a23-16bdb9dacd4d"]}, "b8a7413f-b95c-42a2-9a23-16bdb9dacd4d": {"id": "b8a7413f-b95c-42a2-9a23-16bdb9dacd4d", "message": {"id": "b8a7413f-b95c-42a2-9a23-16bdb9dacd4d", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716769303.543295, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To comprehensively assess the sustainability of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) production, it is essential to consider a range of indicators that align with the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency, substitution, economic, environmental, social sustainability, inter-generational equity, and institutional sustainability. Each of these principles can be measured using specific metrics, such as material and energy intensity, water consumption, emission of toxic substances, human health implications, fair labor practices, and the overall impact on the community. These metrics help in evaluating the breadth and depth of sustainability practices within the EVOO production process and are critical for making informed decisions aimed at improving sustainability outcomes over time.\n\nIn the context of material intensity, EVOO production demands significant resources, particularly in packaging and equipment. Glass, commonly used for oil bottling, is notably energy-intensive to produce and contributes to higher CO2 emissions. This highlights the need for more sustainable packaging solutions, such as recycled or lighter glass, which could decrease material intensity and environmental impact. Similarly, the metals used in processing equipment also require consideration, particularly in terms of the energy and resources consumed during their manufacture and eventual recycling or disposal.\n\nEnergy and water consumption are equally critical metrics. The operation of irrigation systems and processing facilities consumes substantial energy, which can be mitigated by integrating renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to reduce the carbon footprint of production processes. On the water front, olive cultivation, particularly in drier regions, necessitates significant water usage. Employing sustainable water management practices, such as the adoption of drip irrigation systems, can dramatically decrease water consumption, preserving vital water resources. Additionally, the use of pesticides and fertilizers in olive farming introduces toxic emissions and pollutants that can affect both soil and water quality. Implementing organic farming practices and optimizing transportation and logistics can help minimize these environmental impacts.\n\nBeyond environmental considerations, the human dimension of sustainability is pivotal. Protecting human health and safety in EVOO production involves minimizing workers&#x27; exposure to harmful chemicals, ensuring proper safety training, and providing adequate protective equipment. Furthermore, adhering to labor laws and embracing fair trade practices are essential to guarantee fair wages and good working conditions for all employees. Finally, the broader community impact of companies like Farchioni should be recognized, as they often support local initiatives in education and healthcare, contributing positively to the social fabric of their operating regions. These efforts not only enhance community well-being but also bolster the social sustainability of the business practices. By addressing these various sustainability indicators, companies can not only comply with current standards but also set new benchmarks for responsible production in the industry."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

[&quot;So I saw a TikTok on Thursday, and on the opening, the introduction was discussing how there is another sort of mythical TikToker, who I&#x27;ve never like seen before, but I have heard of many people referencing his words, so I know it has to be out there, saying that like the amount of olive oil that you can just see, like if you go into the store, the amount of olive oil on the shelves or whatever, like just the selection in and of itself, that there are not enough olive groves in the entire world to support like the amount of product that people consume or is just present within their local consumer place, I guess. And um, anyway, this lady then goes to be like, but the way that you can tell if your olive oil is real, and then she does this thing where she had like two different kinds of olive oil, and she puts one of the olive oils in the refrigerator, like to see if it solidifies, because as we all know, olive oil should, it has a kind of a viscosity or whatever. Anyway, I don&#x27;t know the science word for it, but if you put it in the refrigerator, it should not like go hard, like butter or lard or something. So she does this, and it goes hard, like, well one of the bottles goes, because she does work two different bottles, one of the bottles goes hard, it&#x27;s like some cheap looking bottle, I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s that extra virgin olive oil. Long story short, I&#x27;m gonna try and do this little thing myself. And also it kind of makes me wonder, like, as we discuss about sustainability, and I&#x27;m thinking hard on this assignment, uh, is it sustainable? Like, basically the question becomes, when we go, what the guy posed is that, what the amount of selection we have of olive oil, like the total quantity that&#x27;s supposedly on the available on the market, that we don&#x27;t have enough olive groves to sustain that. So it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s sort of the implication that we already are at a non- sustainable, or a level that is, is insubstantial or unsustainable. So, unsustainable. And so, um, we need to check about that. Like, that&#x27;s our main research question, uh, research question about the sustainability of olive oil production, let&#x27;s say, and the product being extra virgin olive oil.&quot;]\n\n There are  also two distinct research questions between what we have here so far and what I&#x27;ve attached however just create a melding of the two versions to best fit our narrative and the assignment in structions. \n\nFinally here are the assignment instructions: \nFor this assignment, you will write a 5-6 page paper.

To start I generously poured Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) into the pan and added aromatic ingredients such as garlic basil and onion. Alongside the pasta bake I&#x27;ll be serving a cheesy garlic bread which also incorporates a significant amount of olive oil. I don&#x27;t mind using EVOO as it is not only a fundamental ingredient in Italian cuisine but also renowned for its health benefits and culinary versatility. Nevertheless similar to many agricultural products EVOO production presents various sustainability challenges that must be addressed to ensure long-term viability and minimal environmental impact. This paper critically assesses the sustainability of EVOO production emphasizing the necessity for cooperative resource allocation systems to foster a more sustainable future.\nBackground of EVOO Production\nEVOO production in Italy has a rich history dating back to ancient times. Italy is one of the largest producers of olive oil with numerous small-scale family-owned farms contributing significantly to the industry. For the purpose of this analysis we focus on Farchioni a renowned EVOO producer with a long-standing market presence. Farchioni employs both traditional and modern methods in its production process from olive cultivation to oil extraction and distribution. This blend of methods highlights both the potential and the challenges of achieving sustainability in a traditional yet globally significant industry.\nItaly&#x27;s EVOO production is characterized by a diversity of practices and regional specialties. The Umbria region for instance is noted for its small-scale farms that face several challenges including high management costs small farm sizes and an aging farming population. Despite these challenges innovative approaches such as fuzzy cognitive mapping have been employed to identify and address key issues in the EVOO value chain focusing on sustainability and climate change adaptation (Pisanelli et al. 2023). Such regional studies underscore the importance of local knowledge and stakeholder engagement in preserving the cultural and economic heritage of EVOO production.\nThe integration of modern technology in EVOO production is exemplified by Farchioni\u2019s use of advanced methods for traceability and quality assurance. For example open-source spectrophotometers coupled with artificial intelligence have proven effective in assessing the geographical origin of EVOO ensuring authenticity and protecting against fraud. These technologies not only enhance consumer trust but also support the &quot;Made in Italy&quot; brand which is crucial for maintaining the high market value of Italian EVOO (Violino et al. 2020).\nSustainability in EVOO production involves evaluating the environmental impacts throughout the entire lifecycle from cultivation to distribution. A comprehensive study in Umbria assessed the carbon and energy footprints of EVOO identifying distribution and packaging as significant sources of environmental impact. Recommendations for improvement include shifts in transportation policies the use of lighter packaging materials and the adoption of renewable energy sources in farming operations (Rinaldi et al. 2014). These findings highlight the potential for reducing the environmental footprint of EVOO through targeted interventions in the production process.\nSustainability Metrics\nTo assess the sustainability of EVOO production we adopt the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency substitution economic sustainability environmental sustainability social sustainability inter-generational equity and institutional sustainability. Specific metrics tailored to EVOO production include material intensity energy intensity water consumption toxic emissions and pollutants human health and safety fair wages and working conditions and community impact.\nAnalysis of Sustainability Indicators\nMaterial intensity in EVOO production involves various materials such as glass bottles for packaging and metal for processing equipment. The extraction and processing of these materials have significant environmental impacts. For instance glass production is energy-intensive and contributes to CO2 emissions. Energy consumption in EVOO production is substantial from powering irrigation systems to operating processing facilities. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind can reduce the carbon footprint of these operations (G\u00f3mez-Lim\u00f3n &amp; Sanchez-Fernandez 2010).\nWater consumption is another critical factor. Olive cultivation requires substantial water especially in arid regions. Sustainable water management practices such as drip irrigation can significantly reduce water usage and mitigate impacts on local water resources (Berbel &amp; Mesa-Jurado 2015). The use of pesticides and fertilizers in olive farming leads to soil and water contamination while emissions from transportation and processing contribute to air pollution. Implementing organic farming practices and optimizing logistics can help reduce these impacts.\nHuman health and safety are also paramount. Exposure to chemicals and poor working conditions pose significant health risks to workers. Ensuring the use of safe non-toxic inputs and providing proper safety training and equipment are crucial (Palomo-Campesino Lima &amp; Sainz 2018). Additionally fair wages and decent working conditions are essential for the social sustainability of the olive oil industry. Ensuring compliance with labor laws and supporting fair trade practices can improve workers&#x27; quality of life.\nEVOO production can have positive impacts on local economies by providing jobs and supporting local businesses. Companies like Farchioni engage in social responsibility initiatives that benefit local communities such as supporting local education and healthcare (Farchioni 2021).\nSupply Chain Model\nThe supply chain for EVOO includes several stages: olive cultivation and harvesting processing and extraction packaging and storage and distribution and retail. Each stage presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. For example improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the overall sustainability of the product.\nInformation Gaps and Inferences\nThere are notable gaps in available data particularly regarding comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production. Data on the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing is limited. However comparative analysis with similar agricultural products such as wine or almond production provides insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products show that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints.\nRole as Chief Sustainability Officer\nAs Chief Sustainability Officer several measures can be prioritized to enhance sustainability in the company&#x27;s operations. These include enhancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use implementing sustainable water management practices improving waste management and reducing emissions and ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions. Progress can be measured by setting specific measurable goals conducting regular sustainability audits publicly reporting on sustainability performance engaging stakeholders and maintaining open communication about progress and challenges.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion the sustainability of EVOO production can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use water consumption emissions and social impacts. Cooperative systems of resource allocation emphasizing community involvement and fair practices are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry. By adopting these measures companies can contribute to a more sustainable future while maintaining the cultural and economic significance of EVOO production in Italy.\n\nReferences\n\nBarber J. &amp; Taylor J.

Studies have identified distribution and packaging as significant sources of environmental impact, suggesting improvements in transportation policies, lighter packaging materials, and renewable energy sources to reduce the carbon and energy footprints of EVOO.\n\n#### Sustainability Metrics\n\nTo assess the sustainability of EVOO production, we adopt the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency, substitution, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, social sustainability, inter-generational equity, and institutional sustainability. Specific metrics include material intensity, energy intensity, water consumption, toxic emissions and pollutants, human health and safety, fair wages and working conditions, and community impact.\n\n#### Analysis of Sustainability Indicators\n\n- **Material Intensity**: EVOO production involves various materials, such as glass bottles for packaging and metal for processing equipment. Glass production is energy-intensive, contributing to CO2 emissions.\n- **Energy Intensity**: Significant energy consumption occurs in powering irrigation systems and processing facilities. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind can reduce the carbon footprint.\n- **Water Consumption**: Olive cultivation requires substantial water, especially in arid regions. Sustainable water management practices, such as drip irrigation, can significantly reduce water usage.\n- **Toxic Emissions and Pollutants**: Pesticides and fertilizers used in olive farming can lead to soil and water contamination. Emissions from transportation and processing contribute to air pollution. Organic farming practices and optimized logistics can mitigate these impacts.\n- **Human Health and Safety**: Exposure to chemicals and poor working conditions pose health risks to workers. Ensuring safe, non-toxic inputs and providing proper safety training and equipment are crucial.\n- **Fair Wages and Working Conditions**: Ensuring compliance with labor laws and supporting fair trade practices can improve workers&#x27; quality of life.\n- **Community Impact**: Companies like Farchioni engage in social responsibility initiatives that benefit local communities, such as supporting education and healthcare.\n\n#### Supply Chain Model\n\nThe supply chain for EVOO includes several stages: olive cultivation and harvesting, processing and extraction, packaging and storage, and distribution and retail. Each stage presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. Improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the overall sustainability of the product.\n\n#### Information Gaps and Inferences\n\nThere are notable gaps in available data, particularly regarding comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production. Data on the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing is limited. However, comparative analysis with similar agricultural products, such as wine or almond production, provides insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products show that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints.\n\n#### Role as Chief Sustainability Officer\n\nAs Chief Sustainability Officer, several measures can be prioritized to enhance sustainability in the company&#x27;s operations. These include enhancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use, implementing sustainable water management practices, improving waste management and reducing emissions, and ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions. Progress can be measured by setting specific measurable goals, conducting regular sustainability audits, publicly reporting on sustainability performance, engaging stakeholders, and maintaining open communication about progress and challenges.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe sustainability of EVOO production can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use, water consumption, emissions, and social impacts. Cooperative systems of resource allocation, emphasizing community involvement and fair practices, are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry. By adopting these measures, companies can contribute to a more sustainable future while maintaining the cultural and economic significance of EVOO production in Italy.\n\n#### References\n\n- Barber, J., &amp; Taylor, J.

Ensuring safe, non-toxic inputs and providing proper safety training and equipment are crucial.\nFair Wages and Working Conditions: Ensuring compliance with labor laws and supporting fair trade practices can improve workers&#x27; quality of life.\nCommunity Impact: Companies like Farchioni engage in social responsibility initiatives that benefit local communities, such as supporting education and healthcare.\nSupply Chain Model\nThe supply chain for EVOO includes several stages: olive cultivation and harvesting, processing and extraction, packaging and storage, and distribution and retail. Each stage presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. Improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the overall sustainability of the product.\n\nInformation Gaps and Inferences\nThere are notable gaps in available data, particularly regarding comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production. Data on the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing is limited. However, comparative analysis with similar agricultural products, such as wine or almond production, provides insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products show that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints.\n\nRole as Chief Sustainability Officer\nAs Farchioni\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer, several measures can be prioritized to enhance sustainability in the company&#x27;s operations. These include enhancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use, implementing sustainable water management practices, improving waste management and reducing emissions, and ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions. Progress can be measured by setting specific measurable goals, conducting regular sustainability audits, publicly reporting on sustainability performance, engaging stakeholders, and maintaining open communication about progress and challenges.\n\nConclusion\nReflecting back to the initial question of whether the levels of EVOO production are sustainable, the answer is complex. Farchioni&#x27;s EVOO did not solidify in the refrigerator, maintaining its same viscosity and overall physical properties, indicating its authenticity. However, as for the sustainability of EVOO production, it can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use, water consumption, emissions, and social impacts. Cooperative systems of resource allocation, emphasizing community involvement and fair practices, are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry. By adopting these measures, companies can contribute to a more sustainable future while maintaining the cultural and economic significance of EVOO production in Italy."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "request_id": "88a1126cdf79bae1-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "83c74256-8cba-4df0-9990-a83e6b1517cd", "children": ["fe5318ad-e05a-4900-9e26-c68ce1907b33"]}, "fe5318ad-e05a-4900-9e26-c68ce1907b33": {"id": "fe5318ad-e05a-4900-9e26-c68ce1907b33", "message": {"id": "fe5318ad-e05a-4900-9e26-c68ce1907b33", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716751043.097824, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Albeit a small share in world edible vegetable oils, less than 3.5 %, it has for centuries dominated the countries of the Mediterranean basin, which account for nearly 98% of the olive oil and table olives world production. The agronomic and climatic factors characteristic only to the Mediterranean Basin provided the necessary conditions for the development of such a significant olive oil and table olives sector. The available statistical data constitute a valuable source of information but two preliminary remarks should be taken into account. Firstly, the official data of production in the E.U. countries are determined according to the quantities eligible for the subsidy given to the producer. Official production data determine the quantities put down as consumption since after taking into account the import and export data of every country the balance must close. In the long run, the olive oil supply is affected by a number of structural factors, which are pointed out in this chapter. World consumption follows a parallel path with that of world production but with less marked fluctuations. The approach focuses on five different groups of countries. Comparisons between olive oil and other vegetable oils bring out some factors that are discussed in the chapter.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Vassilis Zampounis&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2006,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/world-market-zampounis/af3c70f1bb9b5a28aae4b731f20b4411/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1016/B978-1-893997-88-2.50007-9&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;21-39&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:3},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Diet, trade and land use: a socio-ecological analysis of the transformation of the olive oil system&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Abstract Within only two decades olive oil developed from a niche product which could hardly be found in food stores outside the producing regions towards an integrated component in the diets of industrial countries. This paper discusses the impacts of the promotion of the \u201chealthy Mediterranean diet\u201d on land use and agro-ecosystems in the producing countries. It examines the dynamics of olive oil production, trade and consumption in the EU15 in the period 1972\u20132003 and the links between dietary patterns, trade and land use. It analyses the underlying socio-economic driving forces behind the increasing spatial disconnect between production and consumption of olive oil in the EU15 and in particular in Spain, the world largest producer during the last three decades. In the observed period olive oil consumption increased 16-fold in the non-producing EU15 countries. In the geographically limited producing regions like Spain, the fivefold increase in export production was associated with the rapid industrialization of olive production, the conversion of vast Mediterranean landscapes to olive monocultures and a range of environmental pressures. High amounts of subsidies of the European Common Agricultural Policy and feedback loops within production and consumption systems were driving the transformation of the olive oil system. Our analysis indicates the process of change was not immediately driven by increases in demand for olive oil in non-producing countries, but rather by the institutional setting of the European Union and by concerted political interventions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Traditionally, the olive oil industry has played a significant economic role only in the Mediterranean basin countries, including Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, and Syria. However, in recent decades olive cultivation has become more important in other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, the United States, countries in South America, South Africa, and India. Olive oil has a long history of medicinal, magical, and even fiduciary uses. The European Union accounts for 71 percent of global olive oil consumption, while Mediterranean basin countries account for 77 percent of world consumption. Olive oil constitutes just 2 percent of all edible oils, and is considered to be a niche market directed at discerning oil consumers. Intensive promotion efforts emphasizing the various health and industrially important properties of olive oil, together with significant progress in the understanding of human nutrition and diet needs, have yielded a continuing increase in demand for olive oil among consumers throughout the world.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Z.

Also, the great gastronomic and health consideration of these products, as well as their relative scarcity and specificity makes them well considered and paid in the globalised markets, which have absorbed without difficulty the increase in production experienced in the last decades. In this context we witnessed the expansion and intensification of its production in its region of origin, but it is also being planted in areas which do not necessarily share the ideal thermopluviometric conditions for this crop. The purpose of this paper is to show, in a spatiotemporal point of view, the expansive dynamic of the olive tree. The main conclusion is this cycle has a very important potential growth ahead, but is not exempt of limitations and doubts, both for the new productive regions and the Mediterranean regions that are specialised in this millennial crop.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Despite this, there are enormous geographical differences in olive oil supply among Mediterranean countries, with 30-fold differences found during the 1960s. Thus describing olive oil supply at a regional level can provide useful information on the regional variations in dietary patterns compared to describing the Mediterranean diet as a uniform entity. In addition to important geographical differences, several studies have shown that considerable temporal changes have taken place in the dietary patterns of Mediterranean countries over the last 3\u20134 decades, with important changes in some, but not all, of the components. In terms of olive oil, there are differences in olive oil supply and consumption across time, but these changes are not uniform across Mediterranean countries. This chapter gives an overview of the temporal trends in olive oil production, supply, and consumption in 15 Mediterranean countries from the 1960s up until the present day. The countries have been defined as Mediterranean using the broad definition that they are in geographical contact with the Mediterranean Sea. They include five European Mediterranean countries\u2014Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Cyprus\u2014and ten African or Asiatic Mediterranean countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey. As non-Mediterranean countries account for less than 3.5% of world olive oil production, this chapter focuses on production in Mediterranean countries only, using production data provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

Olive cultivation is mostly confined to southern regions, which overall account for about 80% of national olive oil production. In Calabria, olive growing plays a significant economic role, particularly in rural contexts, although olive growers have to face different problems such as high production costs, low productivity and low levels of mechanization of agricultural practices. However, many olive farms produce high-quality olive oil, thanks to both more efficient farming management and the adoption of product and process innovations. This paper aims to assess the long-term feasibility of different olive-growing systems in the Calabrian region (southern Italy) by means of joint use of a life cycle costing (LCC) approach and dynamic evaluation methods. The economic analysis allowed us to recognize the main hotspots within the product life of each system analyzed, useful to identify potential enhancements to the production process and to give rise to greater levels of profitability. Our results highlighted a suitable level of economic viability for almost all systems investigated, in particular when public subsidies from the European Union were considered. Our research could be useful to suggest the adoption of possible improvement strategies for corporate decision-making processes, to achieve appropriate economic sustainability performance.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;T.

The European Union countries produce 78.5\u00a0% of the total olive oil, which stands for an average production of 2,136,000\u00a0tons. The worldwide consumption of olive oil increased of 78\u00a0% between 1990 and 2010. The increase in olive oil production implies a proportional increase in olive mill wastes. As a consequence of such increasing trend, olive mills are facing severe environmental problems due to lack of feasible and/or cost-effective solutions to olive-mill waste management. Therefore, immediate attention is required to find a proper way of management to deal with olive mill waste materials in order to minimize environmental pollution and associated health risks. One of the interesting uses of solid wastes generated from olive mills is to convert them as inexpensive adsorbents for water pollution control. In this review paper, an extensive list of adsorbents (prepared by utilizing different types of olive mill solid waste materials) from vast literature has been compiled, and their adsorption capacities for various aquatic pollutants removal are presented. Different physicochemical methods that have been used to convert olive mill solid wastes into efficient adsorbents have also been discussed. Characterization of olive-based adsorbents and adsorption mechanisms of various aquatic pollutants on these developed olive-based adsorbents have also been discussed in detail. Conclusions have been drawn from the literature reviewed, and suggestions for future research are proposed.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

This study aims at overcoming this gap in research by providing a foresight of global supply and demand for olive oil for the years to come. We use the Delphi technique to estimate the expected annual growth rates in the olive oil production and consumption worldwide as well as their likely impact on Spanish exports by 2025. Another key objective of the study is to elicit expert judgements on the factors that are likely to shape the predicted changes as well as the international challenges ahead. Results suggest substantial future increases in production in new-producing countries, in parallel with a slower growth in the European traditional suppliers whose focus will increasingly be placed on quality and sustainability rather than quantity. In addition, a significant growth in the world\u2019s demand for olive oil is expected in non-traditional markets, which will be driven by greater awareness of the positive health and sustainability attributes of this product, jointly with the changes in lifestyles and rising incomes of several consumer segments. These emerging markets offer promising prospects for the international expansion of olive oil companies. Future international challenges facing the olive oil industry include new market entry, worldwide product promotion, quality standards\u2019 harmonization, enacting trade facilitation schemes, and dealing with the COVID-19 impacts. Findings improve market predictability and transparency, and ultimately support decision-making and strategic planning in the olive oil sector.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

The consumption has increased in countries where olive oil is not part of the traditional diet, as for example Germany and the UK, where the average consumption grew by 11% and 13% respectively during the period 1995\u20132003. The opening of new nontraditional markets has shifted exports and restructured the supply chain. Mediterranean countries have been the traditional suppliers of olive oil with the EU Mediterranean Member States being the main exporters, while the non-EU Mediterranean countries try to gain market shares in the EU markets in an attempt to benefit from the preferential access due to the Barcelona Agreement. This article tries to identify which factors influenced olive oil demand of nontraditional consumers using evidence from Germany and the with the help of a gravity model. The results of the random effects models corrected for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity indicate that being a Mediterranean Partner Country enhances olive oil exports to Germany and the UK. Moreover olive oil exports are positively related to direct marketing strategies and tourism, implying that these factors have the largest impact on the olive oil exports from producing countries and consequently on the overall supply chain.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

However, the impacts of agrifood production and consumption patterns on the environment are considerable, mainly due to the demand of large inputs of resources. This paper presents a case study of olive oil production in Greece, an important agri-product especially for countries in the Mediterranean basin. Life Cycle Assessment has been used to quantify the environmental performance of olive oil production. Fourteen sub-systems of the overall olive oil production are investigated. All key parameters that are associated with the life cycle of olive oil production are studied and environmental \u201chotspots\u201d are diagnosed. Cultivation of olive trees and production of olive oil are the sub-systems that are responsible for the majority of the environmental impacts and thus any effort to minimize the overall life cycle impact from olive oil production should include them.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;P.

The aim of this study is to contribute to overcome this weakness by providing a foresight of global supply and demand for olive oil for the upcoming years, using an iterative consensus-building Delphi approach. Therefore, we estimate the expected annual growth rates in the olive oil production and consumption worldwide as well as their likely impact on Spanish exports. Another key objective of the study is to elicit expert judgements on the factors that are likely to shape the predicted changes as well as the international challenges ahead. Results point to substantial future increases in production in new-producing countries, in parallel with a slower growth in the EU traditional suppliers whose focus will increasingly be placed on the quality and sustainability rather than the quantity of olive oil produced.

These emerging markets represent valuable opportunities for marketing and promoting olive oil as a highly valued product, and offer promising prospects for the international expansion of olive oil companies.

After Spain, Italy is the second largest olive oil producing country (27% and 20% of European and world production respectively) and Sicily is the third most important olive oil producing region in Italy (8% of Italian production) after Puglia and Calabria which account for almost 70% of national production. In Sicily, the province of Messina occupies sixth place in regional production and production is characterized by eight predominant cultivars (with different nutritional, organoleptic and productivity characteristics) and a variety of different practices and techniques for the agricultural production of olives and for their processing into olive oil. Depending on these differences, the production of olive oil is associated with several adverse effects on the environment, both in the agricultural and olive oil production phases. The aim of this paper is to provide useful information for taking strategic decisions aimed at the improvement and optimization of the local olive oil production chain in the province of Messina. To this purpose the LCA methodology has been used to determine the potential environmental impacts of activities connected to olive oil production in the province, in order to identify the processes which give rise to the most significant environmental problems and to design a more efficient and environmentally friendly local olive oil chain. Data on the various agricultural and industrial methods used in the province were obtained through the development of a questionnaire, then distributed to a sample of companies of the local association of oil producers (APOM). The study is part of the Eco-Management for Food - EMAF - Project (PRIN 2008 No. 2008TXFBYT - http://ww2.unime.it/emaf ) co-funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR).&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

The production process involves many stages: farming, extraction, packing, and waste treatment. Each one of these stages should present critical points for the environmental impacts, and for this reason, the entire sector is adopting mitigation strategies to begin to be more sustainable. The mitigation actions\u2019 efficiency should be evaluated through environmental indicators or environmental impact assessment by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This review aimed to carry out an overview of recent papers (2011\u20132021) involving an LCA study in the olive oil supply chain by giving a framework of what is included in LCA studies and highlighting the main contributors to environmental impacts. The main scholarly literature databases have been exploited, highlighting a great increase in publications, especially from the producer countries. The review results reflect the heterogeneity of the production process. However, the use of pesticides, fertilizers, water, and fuel for machinery heavily weigh on the farming stage\u2019s environmental impact. Finally, special focus was given to key elements of LCA studies in the olive oil supply chain, such as functional unit, system boundaries, impact categories, calculation method, and software widely used.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

Apart from its significant impact on the economies of countries in Southern Europe, Northern Africa and Middle East, olive oil production also involves considerable social and environmental considerations. However, despite such importance, the environmental effects of olive oil production have not been studied as much other agricultural productions and farming systems, which are more characteristic of central and northern Europe. We present a thorough and systematic literature review of scientific publications with respect to the use of environmental tools in the life cycle of olive oil. The analysis takes into consideration the farming of olive trees, the manufacture of olive oil, packaging, transportation and reverse logistics. To that end, journal publications up to 2015 in this specific field are recorded and, at the same time, the most important environmental impacts are revealed and a gap analysis is carried out. The analysis conducted reveals that farming of olive trees (with pesticide use and waste/by-product production being the &#x27;hottest&#x27; topics) and the manufacturing of olive oil (concentrating mostly on waste/by-product production and management) are the phases with the highest environmental focus from the scientific community. Moreover, gaps in the literature are detected mostly with respect to fuel consumption and the use and promotion of renewable energy sources in olive oil production. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

These selected countries are the main olive oil producers and mainly located in Mediterranean Seacoast. Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey will be the subject countries in this analysis and compared with each other in terms of their export performance and comparative advantage in olive oil industry globally. Olive oil industry has a volume of around 20 billion Euros every year. Design/methodology/approach: The data for the research was collected from mainly World Bank and trade ministries of subject countries. Revealed Comparative advantage Index (RCA) is used to compare the advantage of these countries in olive oil industry. These indexes found in this analysis will be added to the olive oil RCA indexes of these countries that are found in the previous researches. The obtained data were analyzed through RCA Index formula modeling. Findings:Consuming olive oil is increasing day by day over the world. The research results show that Turkey has comparative advantage in olive industry over Greece. Last few years, Turkey has improved its comparative advantage over Italy. Spain and Italy are the leading countries in olive oil industry in terms of comparative advantage. It has also been found that Turkey has consistently increase its advantage over the last decade. Practical implications: After the comparison of RCA indexes of Spain, Greece, Italy and Turkey, it is found that higher amount of production of olive oil is not enough itself to improve the competitiveness of a country in olive oil market. Branding, packaging and marketing activities that are supported by research and development expenditures are highly important factors for a consistent competitive advantage in olive oil industry. Olive oil consumers are highly motivated on the packaging and label of a product when it comes to olive oil. They usually trust Mediterranean brands comparing to others. Originality/value: The study answers the advantages of selected countries in terms of olive oil performance in global markets. Export performance of olive oil is much likely to improve the competitiveness of a country rather than a country that produces high volume of olive oil. Production itself is not enough to increase competitiveness of a country in olive oil market.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Abdulmusa S\u00f6nm\u00fc\u015f&quot;,&quot;M.

Olive oil usage has increased dramatically in recent years, owing to its organoleptic characteristics and rising knowledge of its health advantages. The culture of olive trees and the manufacture of industrial and table olive oil produces enormous volumes of solid waste and dark liquid effluents, involving olive leaves, pomace, and olive oil mill wastewaters. These by-products cause an economic issue for manufacturers and pose major environmental concerns. As a result, partial reuse, like other agronomical production wastes, is a goal to be achieved. Because these by-products are high in bioactive chemicals, which, if isolated, might denote components with significant added value for the food, cosmetic, and nutraceutical sectors, indeed, they include significant amounts of beneficial organic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, and phenolic materials, which are distributed differently between the various wastes depending on the olive oil production method and table olive agronomical techniques. However, the extraction and recovery of bioactive materials from chosen by-products is a significant problem of their reasonable value, and rigorous detection and quantification are required. The primary aims of this review in this context are to outline the vital bioactive chemicals in olive by-products, evaluate the main developments in extraction, purification, and identification, and study their uses in food packaging systems and safety problems.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

Currently, olive oil production represents an important economic income for Mediterranean countries, where roughly 98% of the world production is located. Both the cultivation of olive trees and the production of industrial and table olive oil generate huge amounts of solid wastes and dark liquid effluents, including olive leaves and pomace and olive oil mill wastewaters. Besides representing an economic problem for producers, these by-products also pose serious environmental concerns, thus their partial reuse, like that of all agronomical production residues, represents a goal to pursue. This aspect is particularly important since the cited by-products are rich in bioactive compounds, which, once extracted, may represent ingredients with remarkable added value for food, cosmetic and nutraceutical industries. Indeed, they contain considerable amounts of valuable organic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, and above all, phenolic compounds, that are variably distributed among the different wastes, depending on the employed production process of olive oils and table olives and agronomical practices. Yet, extraction and recovery of bioactive components from selected by-products constitute a critical issue for their rational valorization and detailed identification and quantification are mandatory. The most used analytical methods adopted to identify and quantify bioactive compounds in olive oil by-products are based on the coupling between gas- (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS), with MS being the most useful and successful detection tool for providing structural information. Without derivatization, LC-MS with electrospray (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical (APCI) ionization sources has become one of the most relevant and versatile instrumental platforms for identifying phenolic bioactive compounds. In this review, the major LC-MS accomplishments reported in the literature over the last two decades to investigate olive oil processing by-products, specifically olive leaves and pomace and olive oil mill wastewaters, are described, focusing on phenolics and related compounds.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

This paper focuses on the impact of the ownership structure on the efficiency and sensitivities of the producers towards the quality and the environment of the olive oil sector. The efficiency of the olive oil sector was estimated by Data Envelopment Analysis. The Meta Frontier methodology was carried out in order to consider the ownership structures: cooperatives and private firms. The quality and the environmental compliance of firms were found to be of medium level. The firms analyzed showed a medium tohigh technical efficiency level. Results of bootstrapped truncated regression indicates that ownership structure (private firms), experienced production manager and extensive specialized training within the industry have together a positive effect. However, the number of partners, of permanent unskilled labour and environmental index cause negative effects. In this paper, it is concluded that olive oil firms should solve their environmental and quality problems and reduce their fixed capital. francaisLa production d&#x27;huile d&#x27;olive dans le monde est concentree dans les pays mediterraneens, avec une part importante en Espagne, Italie, Grece, Turquie, Tunisie et Syrie, qui contribuent dans l\u2019ensemble a 85% du total mondial.

This led to a demonstration on how to test if your olive oil is real by refrigerating it to see if it solidifies, a property true for authentic extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Intrigued by this, I decided to explore the sustainability of EVOO production, focusing on Farchioni, as though I were their Chief Sustainability Officer. I wondered, are the current levels of EVOO production sustainable given the high demand and the available agricultural resources?\n\n#### Background of EVOO Production\n\nItaly, a major producer of olive oil, exemplifies the complexities of maintaining sustainability in this industry. EVOO, made by renowned olive oil producer Farchioni, sat chilling in the fridge, and I reflected on their blend of traditional and modern production methods. Farchioni\u2019s approach highlights both the potential and the challenges of sustainability [2]. The Umbria region, known for its small-scale farms, faces issues like high management costs and an aging farming population [3]. Innovative approaches, such as fuzzy cognitive mapping, have been employed to address these challenges, focusing on sustainability and climate change adaptation [4].\n\nModern technology, such as open-source spectrophotometers and artificial intelligence, enhances traceability and quality assurance, ensuring the authenticity of EVOO and protecting against fraud [5]. These technologies support the &quot;Made in Italy&quot; brand, crucial for maintaining the market value of Italian EVOO. Studies have identified distribution and packaging as significant sources of environmental impact, suggesting improvements in transportation policies, lighter packaging materials, and renewable energy sources to reduce the carbon and energy footprints of EVOO [6].\n\n#### Sustainability Metrics\n\nTo assess the sustainability of EVOO production, we adopt the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency, substitution, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, social sustainability, inter-generational equity, and institutional sustainability. Specific metrics include material intensity, energy intensity, water consumption, toxic emissions and pollutants, human health and safety, fair wages and working conditions, and community impact [7].\n\n#### Analysis of Sustainability Indicators\n\n- **Material Intensity**: EVOO production involves various materials, such as glass bottles for packaging and metal for processing equipment. Glass production is energy-intensive, contributing to CO2 emissions [8].\n- **Energy Intensity**: Significant energy consumption occurs in powering irrigation systems and processing facilities. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind can reduce the carbon footprint [9].\n- **Water Consumption**: Olive cultivation requires substantial water, especially in arid regions. Sustainable water management practices, such as drip irrigation, can significantly reduce water usage [10].\n- **Toxic Emissions and Pollutants**: Pesticides and fertilizers used in olive farming can lead to soil and water contamination. Emissions from transportation and processing contribute to air pollution. Organic farming practices and optimized logistics can mitigate these impacts [11].\n- **Human Health and Safety**: Exposure to chemicals and poor working conditions pose health risks to workers. Ensuring safe, non-toxic inputs and providing proper safety training and equipment are crucial [12].\n- **Fair Wages and Working Conditions**: Ensuring compliance with labor laws and supporting fair trade practices can improve workers&#x27; quality of life [13].\n- **Community Impact**: Companies like Farchioni engage in social responsibility initiatives that benefit local communities, such as supporting education and healthcare [14].\n\n#### Supply Chain Model\n\nThe supply chain for EVOO includes several stages: olive cultivation and harvesting, processing and extraction, packaging and storage, and distribution and retail. Each stage presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. Improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the overall sustainability of the product [15].\n\n#### Information Gaps and Inferences\n\nThere are notable gaps in available data, particularly regarding comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production. Data on the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing is limited. However, comparative analysis with similar agricultural products, such as wine or almond production, provides insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products show that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints [16].\n\n#### Role as Chief Sustainability Officer\n\nAs Farchioni\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer, several measures can be prioritized to enhance sustainability in the company&#x27;s operations. These include enhancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use, implementing sustainable water management practices, improving waste management and reducing emissions, and ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions. Progress can be measured by setting specific measurable goals, conducting regular sustainability audits, publicly reporting on sustainability performance, engaging stakeholders, and maintaining open communication about progress and challenges [17].\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nReflecting back to the initial question of whether the levels of EVOO production are sustainable, the answer is complex. Farchioni&#x27;s EVOO did not solidify in the refrigerator, maintaining its same viscosity and overall physical properties, indicating its authenticity [18]. However, as for the sustainability of EVOO production, it can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use, water consumption, emissions, and social impacts. Cooperative systems of resource allocation, emphasizing community involvement and fair practices, are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry. By adopting these measures, companies can contribute to a more sustainable future while maintaining the cultural and economic significance of EVOO production in Italy [19].\n\n#### References\n\n1.

Albeit a small share in world edible vegetable oils, less than 3.5 %, it has for centuries dominated the countries of the Mediterranean basin, which account for nearly 98% of the olive oil and table olives world production. The agronomic and climatic factors characteristic only to the Mediterranean Basin provided the necessary conditions for the development of such a significant olive oil and table olives sector. The available statistical data constitute a valuable source of information but two preliminary remarks should be taken into account. Firstly, the official data of production in the E.U. countries are determined according to the quantities eligible for the subsidy given to the producer. Official production data determine the quantities put down as consumption since after taking into account the import and export data of every country the balance must close. In the long run, the olive oil supply is affected by a number of structural factors, which are pointed out in this chapter. World consumption follows a parallel path with that of world production but with less marked fluctuations. The approach focuses on five different groups of countries. Comparisons between olive oil and other vegetable oils bring out some factors that are discussed in the chapter.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Vassilis Zampounis&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2006,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/world-market-zampounis/af3c70f1bb9b5a28aae4b731f20b4411/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1016/B978-1-893997-88-2.50007-9&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;21-39&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:3},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Diet, trade and land use: a socio-ecological analysis of the transformation of the olive oil system&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Abstract Within only two decades olive oil developed from a niche product which could hardly be found in food stores outside the producing regions towards an integrated component in the diets of industrial countries. This paper discusses the impacts of the promotion of the \u201chealthy Mediterranean diet\u201d on land use and agro-ecosystems in the producing countries. It examines the dynamics of olive oil production, trade and consumption in the EU15 in the period 1972\u20132003 and the links between dietary patterns, trade and land use. It analyses the underlying socio-economic driving forces behind the increasing spatial disconnect between production and consumption of olive oil in the EU15 and in particular in Spain, the world largest producer during the last three decades. In the observed period olive oil consumption increased 16-fold in the non-producing EU15 countries. In the geographically limited producing regions like Spain, the fivefold increase in export production was associated with the rapid industrialization of olive production, the conversion of vast Mediterranean landscapes to olive monocultures and a range of environmental pressures. High amounts of subsidies of the European Common Agricultural Policy and feedback loops within production and consumption systems were driving the transformation of the olive oil system. Our analysis indicates the process of change was not immediately driven by increases in demand for olive oil in non-producing countries, but rather by the institutional setting of the European Union and by concerted political interventions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Traditionally, the olive oil industry has played a significant economic role only in the Mediterranean basin countries, including Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, and Syria. However, in recent decades olive cultivation has become more important in other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, the United States, countries in South America, South Africa, and India. Olive oil has a long history of medicinal, magical, and even fiduciary uses. The European Union accounts for 71 percent of global olive oil consumption, while Mediterranean basin countries account for 77 percent of world consumption. Olive oil constitutes just 2 percent of all edible oils, and is considered to be a niche market directed at discerning oil consumers. Intensive promotion efforts emphasizing the various health and industrially important properties of olive oil, together with significant progress in the understanding of human nutrition and diet needs, have yielded a continuing increase in demand for olive oil among consumers throughout the world.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Z.

Also, the great gastronomic and health consideration of these products, as well as their relative scarcity and specificity makes them well considered and paid in the globalised markets, which have absorbed without difficulty the increase in production experienced in the last decades. In this context we witnessed the expansion and intensification of its production in its region of origin, but it is also being planted in areas which do not necessarily share the ideal thermopluviometric conditions for this crop. The purpose of this paper is to show, in a spatiotemporal point of view, the expansive dynamic of the olive tree. The main conclusion is this cycle has a very important potential growth ahead, but is not exempt of limitations and doubts, both for the new productive regions and the Mediterranean regions that are specialised in this millennial crop.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Despite this, there are enormous geographical differences in olive oil supply among Mediterranean countries, with 30-fold differences found during the 1960s. Thus describing olive oil supply at a regional level can provide useful information on the regional variations in dietary patterns compared to describing the Mediterranean diet as a uniform entity. In addition to important geographical differences, several studies have shown that considerable temporal changes have taken place in the dietary patterns of Mediterranean countries over the last 3\u20134 decades, with important changes in some, but not all, of the components. In terms of olive oil, there are differences in olive oil supply and consumption across time, but these changes are not uniform across Mediterranean countries. This chapter gives an overview of the temporal trends in olive oil production, supply, and consumption in 15 Mediterranean countries from the 1960s up until the present day. The countries have been defined as Mediterranean using the broad definition that they are in geographical contact with the Mediterranean Sea. They include five European Mediterranean countries\u2014Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Cyprus\u2014and ten African or Asiatic Mediterranean countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey. As non-Mediterranean countries account for less than 3.5% of world olive oil production, this chapter focuses on production in Mediterranean countries only, using production data provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

Olive cultivation is mostly confined to southern regions, which overall account for about 80% of national olive oil production. In Calabria, olive growing plays a significant economic role, particularly in rural contexts, although olive growers have to face different problems such as high production costs, low productivity and low levels of mechanization of agricultural practices. However, many olive farms produce high-quality olive oil, thanks to both more efficient farming management and the adoption of product and process innovations. This paper aims to assess the long-term feasibility of different olive-growing systems in the Calabrian region (southern Italy) by means of joint use of a life cycle costing (LCC) approach and dynamic evaluation methods. The economic analysis allowed us to recognize the main hotspots within the product life of each system analyzed, useful to identify potential enhancements to the production process and to give rise to greater levels of profitability. Our results highlighted a suitable level of economic viability for almost all systems investigated, in particular when public subsidies from the European Union were considered. Our research could be useful to suggest the adoption of possible improvement strategies for corporate decision-making processes, to achieve appropriate economic sustainability performance.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;T.

The European Union countries produce 78.5\u00a0% of the total olive oil, which stands for an average production of 2,136,000\u00a0tons. The worldwide consumption of olive oil increased of 78\u00a0% between 1990 and 2010. The increase in olive oil production implies a proportional increase in olive mill wastes. As a consequence of such increasing trend, olive mills are facing severe environmental problems due to lack of feasible and/or cost-effective solutions to olive-mill waste management. Therefore, immediate attention is required to find a proper way of management to deal with olive mill waste materials in order to minimize environmental pollution and associated health risks. One of the interesting uses of solid wastes generated from olive mills is to convert them as inexpensive adsorbents for water pollution control. In this review paper, an extensive list of adsorbents (prepared by utilizing different types of olive mill solid waste materials) from vast literature has been compiled, and their adsorption capacities for various aquatic pollutants removal are presented. Different physicochemical methods that have been used to convert olive mill solid wastes into efficient adsorbents have also been discussed. Characterization of olive-based adsorbents and adsorption mechanisms of various aquatic pollutants on these developed olive-based adsorbents have also been discussed in detail. Conclusions have been drawn from the literature reviewed, and suggestions for future research are proposed.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

This study aims at overcoming this gap in research by providing a foresight of global supply and demand for olive oil for the years to come. We use the Delphi technique to estimate the expected annual growth rates in the olive oil production and consumption worldwide as well as their likely impact on Spanish exports by 2025. Another key objective of the study is to elicit expert judgements on the factors that are likely to shape the predicted changes as well as the international challenges ahead. Results suggest substantial future increases in production in new-producing countries, in parallel with a slower growth in the European traditional suppliers whose focus will increasingly be placed on quality and sustainability rather than quantity. In addition, a significant growth in the world\u2019s demand for olive oil is expected in non-traditional markets, which will be driven by greater awareness of the positive health and sustainability attributes of this product, jointly with the changes in lifestyles and rising incomes of several consumer segments. These emerging markets offer promising prospects for the international expansion of olive oil companies. Future international challenges facing the olive oil industry include new market entry, worldwide product promotion, quality standards\u2019 harmonization, enacting trade facilitation schemes, and dealing with the COVID-19 impacts. Findings improve market predictability and transparency, and ultimately support decision-making and strategic planning in the olive oil sector.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

The consumption has increased in countries where olive oil is not part of the traditional diet, as for example Germany and the UK, where the average consumption grew by 11% and 13% respectively during the period 1995\u20132003. The opening of new nontraditional markets has shifted exports and restructured the supply chain. Mediterranean countries have been the traditional suppliers of olive oil with the EU Mediterranean Member States being the main exporters, while the non-EU Mediterranean countries try to gain market shares in the EU markets in an attempt to benefit from the preferential access due to the Barcelona Agreement. This article tries to identify which factors influenced olive oil demand of nontraditional consumers using evidence from Germany and the with the help of a gravity model. The results of the random effects models corrected for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity indicate that being a Mediterranean Partner Country enhances olive oil exports to Germany and the UK. Moreover olive oil exports are positively related to direct marketing strategies and tourism, implying that these factors have the largest impact on the olive oil exports from producing countries and consequently on the overall supply chain.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

However, the impacts of agrifood production and consumption patterns on the environment are considerable, mainly due to the demand of large inputs of resources. This paper presents a case study of olive oil production in Greece, an important agri-product especially for countries in the Mediterranean basin. Life Cycle Assessment has been used to quantify the environmental performance of olive oil production. Fourteen sub-systems of the overall olive oil production are investigated. All key parameters that are associated with the life cycle of olive oil production are studied and environmental \u201chotspots\u201d are diagnosed. Cultivation of olive trees and production of olive oil are the sub-systems that are responsible for the majority of the environmental impacts and thus any effort to minimize the overall life cycle impact from olive oil production should include them.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;P.

The aim of this study is to contribute to overcome this weakness by providing a foresight of global supply and demand for olive oil for the upcoming years, using an iterative consensus-building Delphi approach. Therefore, we estimate the expected annual growth rates in the olive oil production and consumption worldwide as well as their likely impact on Spanish exports. Another key objective of the study is to elicit expert judgements on the factors that are likely to shape the predicted changes as well as the international challenges ahead. Results point to substantial future increases in production in new-producing countries, in parallel with a slower growth in the EU traditional suppliers whose focus will increasingly be placed on the quality and sustainability rather than the quantity of olive oil produced. Likewise, a significant growth in the world demand for olive oil is expected mostly in non-traditional markets, which will be spurred by greater awareness and appreciation of the product\u2019s health benefits, combined with the changes in lifestyles and the increasing purchasing power of several consumer segments. These emerging markets represent valuable opportunities for marketing and promoting olive oil as a highly valued product, and offer promising prospects for the international expansion of olive oil companies. Findings support decision-making and long-term strategic planning along the olive oil value chain. Researchers can use the results as a reference point for further study of the dynamics of world supply and demand for olive oil.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

After Spain, Italy is the second largest olive oil producing country (27% and 20% of European and world production respectively) and Sicily is the third most important olive oil producing region in Italy (8% of Italian production) after Puglia and Calabria which account for almost 70% of national production. In Sicily, the province of Messina occupies sixth place in regional production and production is characterized by eight predominant cultivars (with different nutritional, organoleptic and productivity characteristics) and a variety of different practices and techniques for the agricultural production of olives and for their processing into olive oil. Depending on these differences, the production of olive oil is associated with several adverse effects on the environment, both in the agricultural and olive oil production phases. The aim of this paper is to provide useful information for taking strategic decisions aimed at the improvement and optimization of the local olive oil production chain in the province of Messina. To this purpose the LCA methodology has been used to determine the potential environmental impacts of activities connected to olive oil production in the province, in order to identify the processes which give rise to the most significant environmental problems and to design a more efficient and environmentally friendly local olive oil chain. Data on the various agricultural and industrial methods used in the province were obtained through the development of a questionnaire, then distributed to a sample of companies of the local association of oil producers (APOM). The study is part of the Eco-Management for Food - EMAF - Project (PRIN 2008 No. 2008TXFBYT - http://ww2.unime.it/emaf ) co-funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR).&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

The production process involves many stages: farming, extraction, packing, and waste treatment. Each one of these stages should present critical points for the environmental impacts, and for this reason, the entire sector is adopting mitigation strategies to begin to be more sustainable. The mitigation actions\u2019 efficiency should be evaluated through environmental indicators or environmental impact assessment by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This review aimed to carry out an overview of recent papers (2011\u20132021) involving an LCA study in the olive oil supply chain by giving a framework of what is included in LCA studies and highlighting the main contributors to environmental impacts. The main scholarly literature databases have been exploited, highlighting a great increase in publications, especially from the producer countries. The review results reflect the heterogeneity of the production process. However, the use of pesticides, fertilizers, water, and fuel for machinery heavily weigh on the farming stage\u2019s environmental impact. Finally, special focus was given to key elements of LCA studies in the olive oil supply chain, such as functional unit, system boundaries, impact categories, calculation method, and software widely used.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

Apart from its significant impact on the economies of countries in Southern Europe, Northern Africa and Middle East, olive oil production also involves considerable social and environmental considerations. However, despite such importance, the environmental effects of olive oil production have not been studied as much other agricultural productions and farming systems, which are more characteristic of central and northern Europe. We present a thorough and systematic literature review of scientific publications with respect to the use of environmental tools in the life cycle of olive oil. The analysis takes into consideration the farming of olive trees, the manufacture of olive oil, packaging, transportation and reverse logistics. To that end, journal publications up to 2015 in this specific field are recorded and, at the same time, the most important environmental impacts are revealed and a gap analysis is carried out. The analysis conducted reveals that farming of olive trees (with pesticide use and waste/by-product production being the &#x27;hottest&#x27; topics) and the manufacturing of olive oil (concentrating mostly on waste/by-product production and management) are the phases with the highest environmental focus from the scientific community. Moreover, gaps in the literature are detected mostly with respect to fuel consumption and the use and promotion of renewable energy sources in olive oil production. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

These selected countries are the main olive oil producers and mainly located in Mediterranean Seacoast. Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey will be the subject countries in this analysis and compared with each other in terms of their export performance and comparative advantage in olive oil industry globally. Olive oil industry has a volume of around 20 billion Euros every year. Design/methodology/approach: The data for the research was collected from mainly World Bank and trade ministries of subject countries. Revealed Comparative advantage Index (RCA) is used to compare the advantage of these countries in olive oil industry. These indexes found in this analysis will be added to the olive oil RCA indexes of these countries that are found in the previous researches. The obtained data were analyzed through RCA Index formula modeling. Findings:Consuming olive oil is increasing day by day over the world. The research results show that Turkey has comparative advantage in olive industry over Greece. Last few years, Turkey has improved its comparative advantage over Italy. Spain and Italy are the leading countries in olive oil industry in terms of comparative advantage. It has also been found that Turkey has consistently increase its advantage over the last decade. Practical implications: After the comparison of RCA indexes of Spain, Greece, Italy and Turkey, it is found that higher amount of production of olive oil is not enough itself to improve the competitiveness of a country in olive oil market. Branding, packaging and marketing activities that are supported by research and development expenditures are highly important factors for a consistent competitive advantage in olive oil industry. Olive oil consumers are highly motivated on the packaging and label of a product when it comes to olive oil. They usually trust Mediterranean brands comparing to others. Originality/value: The study answers the advantages of selected countries in terms of olive oil performance in global markets. Export performance of olive oil is much likely to improve the competitiveness of a country rather than a country that produces high volume of olive oil. Production itself is not enough to increase competitiveness of a country in olive oil market.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Abdulmusa S\u00f6nm\u00fc\u015f&quot;,&quot;M.

Olive oil usage has increased dramatically in recent years, owing to its organoleptic characteristics and rising knowledge of its health advantages. The culture of olive trees and the manufacture of industrial and table olive oil produces enormous volumes of solid waste and dark liquid effluents, involving olive leaves, pomace, and olive oil mill wastewaters. These by-products cause an economic issue for manufacturers and pose major environmental concerns. As a result, partial reuse, like other agronomical production wastes, is a goal to be achieved. Because these by-products are high in bioactive chemicals, which, if isolated, might denote components with significant added value for the food, cosmetic, and nutraceutical sectors, indeed, they include significant amounts of beneficial organic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, and phenolic materials, which are distributed differently between the various wastes depending on the olive oil production method and table olive agronomical techniques. However, the extraction and recovery of bioactive materials from chosen by-products is a significant problem of their reasonable value, and rigorous detection and quantification are required. The primary aims of this review in this context are to outline the vital bioactive chemicals in olive by-products, evaluate the main developments in extraction, purification, and identification, and study their uses in food packaging systems and safety problems.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

Currently, olive oil production represents an important economic income for Mediterranean countries, where roughly 98% of the world production is located. Both the cultivation of olive trees and the production of industrial and table olive oil generate huge amounts of solid wastes and dark liquid effluents, including olive leaves and pomace and olive oil mill wastewaters. Besides representing an economic problem for producers, these by-products also pose serious environmental concerns, thus their partial reuse, like that of all agronomical production residues, represents a goal to pursue. This aspect is particularly important since the cited by-products are rich in bioactive compounds, which, once extracted, may represent ingredients with remarkable added value for food, cosmetic and nutraceutical industries. Indeed, they contain considerable amounts of valuable organic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, and above all, phenolic compounds, that are variably distributed among the different wastes, depending on the employed production process of olive oils and table olives and agronomical practices. Yet, extraction and recovery of bioactive components from selected by-products constitute a critical issue for their rational valorization and detailed identification and quantification are mandatory. The most used analytical methods adopted to identify and quantify bioactive compounds in olive oil by-products are based on the coupling between gas- (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS), with MS being the most useful and successful detection tool for providing structural information. Without derivatization, LC-MS with electrospray (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical (APCI) ionization sources has become one of the most relevant and versatile instrumental platforms for identifying phenolic bioactive compounds. In this review, the major LC-MS accomplishments reported in the literature over the last two decades to investigate olive oil processing by-products, specifically olive leaves and pomace and olive oil mill wastewaters, are described, focusing on phenolics and related compounds.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

This paper focuses on the impact of the ownership structure on the efficiency and sensitivities of the producers towards the quality and the environment of the olive oil sector. The efficiency of the olive oil sector was estimated by Data Envelopment Analysis. The Meta Frontier methodology was carried out in order to consider the ownership structures: cooperatives and private firms. The quality and the environmental compliance of firms were found to be of medium level. The firms analyzed showed a medium tohigh technical efficiency level. Results of bootstrapped truncated regression indicates that ownership structure (private firms), experienced production manager and extensive specialized training within the industry have together a positive effect. However, the number of partners, of permanent unskilled labour and environmental index cause negative effects. In this paper, it is concluded that olive oil firms should solve their environmental and quality problems and reduce their fixed capital. francaisLa production d&#x27;huile d&#x27;olive dans le monde est concentree dans les pays mediterraneens, avec une part importante en Espagne, Italie, Grece, Turquie, Tunisie et Syrie, qui contribuent dans l\u2019ensemble a 85% du total mondial.

This led to a demonstration on how to test if your olive oil is real by refrigerating it to see if it solidifies, a property true for authentic extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Intrigued by this, I decided to explore the sustainability of EVOO production, focusing on Farchioni, as though I were their Chief Sustainability Officer. I wondered, are the current levels of EVOO production sustainable given the high demand and the available agricultural resources [1, 2, 3, 4]?\n\n#### Background of EVOO Production\n\nItaly, a major producer of olive oil, exemplifies the complexities of maintaining sustainability in this industry. EVOO, made by renowned olive oil producer Farchioni, sat chilling in the fridge, and I reflected on their blend of traditional and modern production methods. Farchioni\u2019s approach highlights both the potential and the challenges of sustainability. The Umbria region, known for its small-scale farms, faces issues like high management costs and an aging farming population [5, 6]. Innovative approaches, such as fuzzy cognitive mapping, have been employed to address these challenges, focusing on sustainability and climate change adaptation.\n\nModern technology, such as open-source spectrophotometers and artificial intelligence, enhances traceability and quality assurance, ensuring the authenticity of EVOO and protecting against fraud [7]. These technologies support the &quot;Made in Italy&quot; brand, crucial for maintaining the market value of Italian EVOO. Studies have identified distribution and packaging as significant sources of environmental impact, suggesting improvements in transportation policies, lighter packaging materials, and renewable energy sources to reduce the carbon and energy footprints of EVOO [8, 9, 10].\n\n#### Sustainability Metrics\n\nTo assess the sustainability of EVOO production, we adopt the seven principles of sustainability: efficiency, substitution, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, social sustainability, inter-generational equity, and institutional sustainability. Specific metrics include material intensity, energy intensity, water consumption, toxic emissions and pollutants, human health and safety, fair wages and working conditions, and community impact [11, 12].\n\n#### Analysis of Sustainability Indicators\n\n- **Material Intensity**: EVOO production involves various materials, such as glass bottles for packaging and metal for processing equipment. Glass production is energy-intensive, contributing to CO2 emissions [13, 14].\n- **Energy Intensity**: Significant energy consumption occurs in powering irrigation systems and processing facilities. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind can reduce the carbon footprint [15].\n- **Water Consumption**: Olive cultivation requires substantial water, especially in arid regions. Sustainable water management practices, such as drip irrigation, can significantly reduce water usage [16].\n- **Toxic Emissions and Pollutants**: Pesticides and fertilizers used in olive farming can lead to soil and water contamination. Emissions from transportation and processing contribute to air pollution. Organic farming practices and optimized logistics can mitigate these impacts [17, 18, 19].\n- **Human Health and Safety**: Exposure to chemicals and poor working conditions pose health risks to workers. Ensuring safe, non-toxic inputs and providing proper safety training and equipment are crucial [20].\n- **Fair Wages and Working Conditions**: Ensuring compliance with labor laws and supporting fair trade practices can improve workers&#x27; quality of life [21].\n- **Community Impact**: Companies like Farchioni engage in social responsibility initiatives that benefit local communities, such as supporting education and healthcare [22].\n\n#### Supply Chain Model\n\nThe supply chain for EVOO includes several stages: olive cultivation and harvesting, processing and extraction, packaging and storage, and distribution and retail. Each stage presents unique sustainability challenges and opportunities. Improving energy efficiency in processing and adopting sustainable packaging materials can significantly enhance the overall sustainability of the product [23, 24].\n\n#### Information Gaps and Inferences\n\nThere are notable gaps in available data, particularly regarding comprehensive lifecycle assessments for EVOO production. Data on the environmental impacts of material extraction and processing is limited. However, comparative analysis with similar agricultural products, such as wine or almond production, provides insights into potential sustainability impacts. Studies on these products show that organic farming practices and renewable energy usage can significantly reduce environmental footprints [25, 26, 27].\n\n#### Role as Chief Sustainability Officer\n\nAs Farchioni\u2019s Chief Sustainability Officer, several measures can be prioritized to enhance sustainability in the company&#x27;s operations. These include enhancing energy efficiency and renewable energy use, implementing sustainable water management practices, improving waste management and reducing emissions, and ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions. Progress can be measured by setting specific measurable goals, conducting regular sustainability audits, publicly reporting on sustainability performance, engaging stakeholders, and maintaining open communication about progress and challenges [28, 29].\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nReflecting back to the initial question of whether the levels of EVOO production are sustainable, the answer is complex. Farchioni&#x27;s EVOO did not solidify in the refrigerator, maintaining its same viscosity and overall physical properties, indicating its authenticity. However, as for the sustainability of EVOO production, it can be significantly improved through targeted measures that address material and energy use, water consumption, emissions, and social impacts. Cooperative systems of resource allocation, emphasizing community involvement and fair practices, are essential for achieving long-term sustainability in the olive oil industry. By adopting these measures, companies can contribute to a more sustainable future while maintaining the cultural and economic significance of EVOO production in Italy [30, 31, 32, 33].\n\n### References\n\n1.

He is the wayward hero of the tarot, the embodiment of the young adventurer just getting started on his quest. He is the only card numbered O in the deck. This means that he is not attached to any identity that he must prove to others. He&#x27;s not the &#x27;King of this,&#x27; or the &#x27;Knight of that.&#x27; He&#x27;s just a fool: simple, unencumbered by worry, and completely free to go where he chooses. The Fool&#x27;s wisdom lies in his lack of pride and ego. He never despairs if he doesn&#x27;t look competent. That&#x27;s just another box he would hate to be suffocated in. He&#x27;s not afraid if people laugh at him. He laughs at himself! This humor gives him an inexhaustible resilience.

He represents the wild and rebellious part of your nature. He goes his own path. The sun is shining, and his spirits are soaring. He is wearing the ugliest pattern this side of creation.

Abandon the self consciousness that prevents you from appearing too enthusiastic in public.

Remember that after all the work and worry of crafting an image for others, you are still a primate. Let go of fears that stem from the ego and concerns about how you appear to others. Find the sunny, warm, funny, innocent, and optimistic spark that waits deep within you, and set it free! You will be much more fun to be around.

When the High Priestess appears, she tells you that the issues you are experiencing are deeper than they may at first appear. She is also calling your attention to the language of signs and symbols.

This language is not literal and cannot be understood by the rational mind alone. Trust your feelings to illuminate what the message is. There is nothing to fear when the High Priestess appears, upright or reversed. There is magic afoot. The Universe is communicating with you in serendipitous and synchronistic ways. It is encouraging you to find the answers to your questions by accessing your inner wisdom. Today, notice any unusual signals you receive. Is there a bird or an animal that finds its way onto your path? What could that animal be teaching you? Is there a color or something that catches your eye? Ask yourself what this means to you. Is there a card from your tarot deck that keeps emerging? What could it be telling you? Today, look on the grand design of the world with the wise eyes of the High Priestess. The answers will be found within, but the Universe will always provide clues in the form of recurring signs.&quot;}}, &quot;symbolism&quot;: [{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The High Priestess is crowned with the moon in its three phases: waxing, full, and waning.

He teaches you that feeling secure can only exist when you establish strong boundaries. If you don&#x27;t stand up for yourself, you are metaphorically wearing a sign that tells others they can take control of your life and its direction. To the Emperor, this is the same as ceding his crown to a lesser king. The Emperor&#x27;s personal honor code forbids victimization. The Emperor is the personification of the voice within that urges you to speak up assertively when something feels unjust. If you continually feel resentful that others aren&#x27;t treating you with respect, it&#x27;s probably because you haven&#x27;t been letting your inner Emperor speak up. Do you feel respected by others and that your personal boundaries are honored? Do you have trouble saying no without an apologetic excuse or a fib?

You don&#x27;t need to justify your right to be, but you do need to stand up for it. Respectfully asserting your position is very empowering if you&#x27;ve been overly passive. This card also portends the need to create structure to aid in the achievement of a goal. Take responsibility for yourself and your dreams. Stand up and protect your realm.

Often this instability results from procrastination on pressing matters that require confrontation. Sometimes this card alerts you to embodying too much passive Empress energy. Confrontation can seem like an uncomfortable concept. We often would much rather avoid the conflict. In truth, avoiding and procrastinating lead to a perpetual sense of inner turmoil and anxiety that is much more difficult to exist with. Confronting issues or projects that have been avoided will revitalize and restore your sense of order, control, and self-confidence. Take responsibility for all that is under your charge. It&#x27;s time to lead, not follow. The Emperor&#x27;s role is to defend, promote, and protect all that he cares for. When the Emperor appears reversed, he also reminds you to step into your majesty. Stop fooling yourself into thinking you can&#x27;t do this. Instead of avoiding that which needs to be reinforced, dive in and change it. Take charge and create the stability you wish to see. Face the issues confronting you and act. The Emperor is the archetype of pro-activity. Meet your deadlines and take charge of your life. Confront your finances, take care of that cavity, dust off your to-do list. The Emperor exemplifies not only control of his empire, but self-control as well. Your self-esteem will skyrocket when you summon the courage to do what is right.&quot;, &quot;questions&quot;: [&quot;What feels unstable in your realm at this time?&quot;, &quot;Have you been embodying passive Empress energy?&quot;, &quot;Are you avoiding confronting pressing matters that require confrontation?&quot;], &quot;advice&quot;: &quot;Identify what feels unstable and confront the issues that have been avoided.

Every culture since the dawn of human history has had a concept of (and instinct toward) spiritual awareness. Some names for this awareness are God, the Universe, the Gods, Higher Power, Spirit, the Goddess, Nature, Angels, the Higher Self, the Great Mystery ... the name is different depending on whom you talk to. Nobody&#x27;s really right or wrong because no one can perceive the complete scope of this infinite thing. Each of us is part of a divine collective, describing the same &#x27;Holiness&#x27; from different vantage points. What is sacred to one may hold no meaning for another. However, the part of our psyche that prays and wishes is universal. Spirit transcends cultural identity and imperfect human perceptions of religion. Even most atheists concede that humans evolved with a biological component in the brain that developed into an instinct toward spiritual belief. Whatever your personal beliefs are, the Hierophant symbolizes one important thing: we humans have an instinct to commune with an awareness bigger than ourselves.&quot;, &quot;attributes&quot;: [&quot;Seeking the sacred&quot;, &quot;Spiritual awareness&quot;, &quot;Instinct toward communion&quot;, &quot;Embracing the divine collective&quot;], &quot;interpretations&quot;: {&quot;upright&quot;: {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;THE HIEROPHANT&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;The Hierophant knows how to reconcile the needs of your heart and soul to overcome your worldly troubles.

If you make time to center, feel your feelings, and quiet mental chatter, your inner wisdom will guide you out of any rut. Sometimes the biggest block to hearing your Spirit&#x27;s inner wisdom is the fear of feeling something uncomfortable. Many people distract themselves from the discomfort and avoid resolving the imbalance. The Hermit represents the need to periodically withdraw from the world and reconnect with your deeper awareness. Do you take time to regularly reconnect with the wisdom residing within your center? Do you habitually distract or numb yourself from what is causing your discomfort rather than looking at it? Are you conscious of the Wise One who resides within? The Hermit takes his lantern into the dark, uncomfortable places to examine what&#x27;s there. His staff and beard symbolize the stability and wisdom that you can always find within. If you examine the card, you&#x27;ll notice he&#x27;s traveling over snow. This symbolizes feelings that you have &#x27;put on ice.&#x27; The snow can also represent freezing or numbing pain. The gentle Hermit comes with his warm, illuminating lantern and his sturdy staff of wisdom. These can melt the cold ice that metaphorically forms around the heart, allowing feelings to be resolved and released. Under his gentle guidance, he can show you the hidden lesson beneath the ice. Does your heart feel like it&#x27;s keeping something frozen? Can you feel the feelings within your heart, or does it feel numb? The fear of discomfort is just a mask, preventing you from accessing your deeper wisdom. One error many people make with the lesson of the Hermit is mistaking &#x27;wisdom&#x27; with &#x27;thinking.&#x27; &#x27;If I just sit here alone and think about this uncomfortable thing for a long time, I will figure it out.&#x27; Thinking about problems just leaves the anxiety in the background to go unchecked as your mind frantically races from one hollow solution to another. Thinking about the discomfort doesn&#x27;t really resolve it. Feeling it does. Many times, people are so scared of feeling that they pull out their phone, have a drink, or binge-watch television, thinking, &#x27;That will get that inner chatter to shut up for a while.&#x27; Avoidance freezes the feeling for a time, but the unfelt feelings remain under the ice and grow in strength until they finally burst through. This process takes longer for some people than others, but it always ends the same... with a twitch, a feeling of being hollow, or a nervous breakdown. If you are courageous enough to go within, seek your discomfort, pull the mask back, and feel the feelings you are avoiding, you will discover that this discomfort is a wise teacher and friend. The deeper awareness residing beneath the fear will calmly tell you what you need. This is your inner Wise One. The inner Wise One will show you how to resolve and release what is troubling you. Today, reflect on what is going on within you. Is there something making you anxious? Are you dulled, numb, or frozen? Take time to connect with the sacred hermit within. He will safely guide you to what lies beneath the ice. There is nothing to fear with the Hermit guiding you. Take the time to light a sacred candle in a quiet place. Be brave and melt any ice that may have formed around your feelings. Pull back surface fears. Look beneath the ice. Examine what the Hermit is guiding you to understand. Another card drawn may illuminate the issue that needs healing. You will know that you have found the answer when you say, &#x27;Aha! That&#x27;s what I needed to resolve within myself.&#x27; The Hermit is an old man walking through snow. This symbolizes slow movement. Take your time to find your way. The lamp of your inner Hermit will guide you out of darkness every time.&quot;, &quot;attributes&quot;: [&quot;Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Introspection&quot;, &quot;Centering&quot;], &quot;interpretations&quot;: {&quot;upright&quot;: {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;THE HERMIT&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;The Hermit represents the need to periodically withdraw from the world and reconnect with your deeper awareness.

These are the events that occur with seeming randomness. They leave you feeling as if you have no control over them. The figures on the turning wheel illustrate that life moves in cycles; during some periods you feel on top of the world, and during others you feel down and out. Chaotic and unplanned things do occur in life. The rim of the wheel represents the external world with all its chaotic unpredictability. The center of the wheel represents your center: the seat of your best self. If you can find your way home to your center, then the random things that occur in the world outside of your control will not feel as disturbing. Are you stuck at the rim of the wheel, rising or falling with each unexpected event in your life? Can you take unexpected events in stride, or are you rigid and inflexible?

The sword and the cloud imagery represent the element of Air and symbolize the powers of the mind to find the patterns in seemingly random occurrences. The mind organizes data through patterns. Amid the Hebrew letters around the wheel are four English letters: T-A-R-O. If read clockwise, starting and ending at the top of the wheel, they spell TAROT.

Staying fixed at the edge of the wheel can get emotionally exhausting rather quickly. The truth is we don&#x27;t have complete control of every life event that occurs. Sometimes bad or unfair things just happen. Other people have free will and can also act unpredictably. Good things can happen to awful people, and terrible things can happen to good people. Some people win the lottery without having done anything to deserve it. Others get hurt through no fault of their own. In life, events rarely go exactly according to plan. These occurrences are outside of our control. However, you do have the ability to control how you respond to life. You can choose to let either your wise Spirit handle the situation, or your fear.&quot;}, &quot;reversed&quot;: {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;The Wheel of Fortune Reversed&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;If the Wheel of Fortune appears reversed, it illuminates repetitive cycles, patterns, and recurring life lessons.

Getting frustrated at the repeated lesson is fruitless. The lesson is recurring because it holds the key to moving forward. Once you accept the lesson and do the work on self-improvement, the wheel will begin to move forward once again. Surrounding cards may illuminate what this life lesson is rooted in.

This the insidious voice within that tells us we aren&#x27;t worthy, that we can&#x27;t be successful, and that we are stuck with our lot. Often this voice pipes up just before we are about to make a huge breakthrough. This voice comes as a final test to see what we really believe about ourselves. The Devil is known by many names, but by far the most fitting is the Prince of Lies. The biggest lie the Devil tells is that he is more powerful than we are. Each day you have a choice to believe the voice that tells you you are garbage or to hear your better angels who remind you that you are worthy. How does your shadow manifest in your life? Do you struggle with self-esteem? Do you feel trapped in a situation that feels beyond your control? When you look at the image of the Devil card, you can see a man and a woman chained to his throne. They are a corrupted version of the innocent and pure man and woman who appear on the Lovers card. The trees that were featured on the Lovers card now appear in the form of unnatural tails sprouting from the pair. This shows how applying life and knowledge solely toward materialism and external gratification leads to corruption. The two figures also sport horns, symbolizing their enslavement to the animal parts of their nature. The animal nature is only concerned with survival and protection of itself. It is not enlightened and manifests in the form of fear, excess, jealousy, anger, hatred, addiction, unforgiveness, and the pursuit of personal comfort over all else. Look closer at the figures chained to the Devil&#x27;s throne. The chains represent the falsehood of being stuck; the chains the figures wear are quite loose. In fact, they could step out of them at any time! This shows that despite the fearful size of the Devil, one can be free of him whenever they choose. When the Devil appears, he calls your attention to the self-limiting thoughts and behaviors that are keeping you imprisoned. You can be free at any time, but you must stop rationalizing these behaviors and confront them honestly. Written on the Devil&#x27;s right hand is the symbol for Saturn. In astrology, Saturn rules limitations, setbacks, and self-improvement over time. This implies that honestly confronting your inner shadows will compel you to improve over time, even if the process feels uncomfortable. The Devil highlights any untruths you may be telling yourself that are keeping you from being the best version of yourself. The shadow is real, but you are more powerful. The best way to transcend shadows is to embody love. Be loving to yourself and others. Don&#x27;t get hooked into defending yourself in the face of someone else&#x27;s shadow. Lovingly help someone else. Be of service. Be kinder. If you are feeling fear, help someone else feel braver. Challenge the lie that you are stuck. Send light and love to those people you can&#x27;t quite seem to forgive. Unhook yourself from the Devil&#x27;s chains. By embodying your better angels, the Devil will lose all power.&quot;, &quot;attributes&quot;: [&quot;Confrontation&quot;, &quot;Shadow self&quot;, &quot;Self-limiting thoughts&quot;, &quot;Corruption&quot;, &quot;Enslavement&quot;, &quot;Fear&quot;, &quot;Excess&quot;, &quot;Jealousy&quot;, &quot;Anger&quot;, &quot;Hatred&quot;, &quot;Addiction&quot;, &quot;Unforgiveness&quot;, &quot;Personal comfort&quot;], &quot;interpretations&quot;: {&quot;upright&quot;: {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;THE DEVIL&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;The Devil is a symbol of your inner saboteur, the voice that tells you that you aren&#x27;t worthy and keeps you stuck.

They built walls around themselves that grew taller and taller. These walls separated them from feeling reality. The Tower gained in size and made them numb. Being numb kept them &#x27;safe from being hurt by the past and the present. In the Tower, they could pretend there was no loss, change, or death happening outside. They would say things like, &#x27;I&#x27;m great! No sad things ever happened; what are you talking about?&#x27; The lightning on the card represents the inevitable crisis the Universe always sends to cause those in denial to wake up and to heal what needs healing. One falling figure is crowned, while the other is not. This symbolizes that being in a state of denial is unsustainable, whether you are a commoner or a king. Are there unresolved hurts from the past that you need to heal, surrender, and clear? What would you rather not deal with right now? Do you zone out to deny reality? Is there a fear that, if you open yourself to feeling it, it will hurt too much and won&#x27;t stop hurting? Despite the destructive imagery, the Tower is one of the most healing cards in the tarot. The Tower snaps us out of pretending we are not hurting. It is a cathartic card where old pains are finally felt and released for healing. In that way, the old pains no longer keep us a prisoner escaping reality. When you reflect on your life, you&#x27;ll realize the moments that made you strongest are often the hard times. Avoiding challenges doesn&#x27;t make us strong - dealing with them does. Denial of truth is unsustainable. Spirit, God, or the Universe always sends along a proverbial lightning bolt to snap us out of delusion. The breakdown moment is surprisingly a blessing. Lightning bolts symbolize flashes of divine magic and epiphanies at play in your life. Once reality is accepted, it can then be healed. The people falling from the Tower are returning to earth. Not only are they returning to reality, but they are returning to their true nature as well. The crowned roof of the Tower is also being ejected, symbolizing a need to get out of the rationalizations of your head and get back to reality. When the Tower appears, it&#x27;s time to stop avoiding something that you know needs to be felt. Don&#x27;t deny your feelings another day or they will continue to keep you imprisoned. Give yourself some privacy and space to really feel something that hurts. Release it through tears or even yelling. A wise teacher of mine told me that if you can&#x27;t scream in the house because there are people around, do it in the car. People will just think you&#x27;re singing. It&#x27;s time to be honest with yourself and feel your real feelings. The Tower represents freedom from feeling trapped.&quot;, &quot;attributes&quot;: [&quot;Transformation&quot;, &quot;Healing&quot;, &quot;Instability&quot;], &quot;interpretations&quot;: {&quot;upright&quot;: {&quot;title&quot;: &quot;THE TOWER&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Upright or reversed, the Tower advises you to allow what you don&#x27;t need to crumble away.

This card is a reminder to find peace within the &quot;in-between&quot; spaces of your life, recognizing that such periods are essential for growth and reflection.\n\n### 2. The Hanged Man\n![The Hanged Man](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/RWS_Tarot_12_Hanged_Man.jpg)\nThe Hanged Man indicates a period of suspension and the need for a different perspective. This card is often associated with sacrifice, waiting, or a major change in how you view your world. It suggests that the transitions and fluctuations brought by the Wheel of Fortune may require you to let go of old ways of thinking and embrace a new perspective that can be transformative.\n\nThese cards together with the Wheel of Fortune indicate a powerful moment of transition in your life, involving necessary pauses and reconsiderations. The Two of Swords speaks to the need for inner peace during uncertain times, while The Hanged Man suggests that by embracing these changes and viewing them from a new angle, you will gain deeper insights and personal growth.

The Empress\n![The Empress](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/RWS_Tarot_03_Empress.jpg)\nThe Empress signifies nurturing, abundance, and protection. This card points to the trust you place in providing care and support, and the trust others place in you due to your nurturing nature. The Empress emphasizes the importance of self-love and the need to nurture not just others but also yourself. It suggests that betrayal may sometimes stem from neglect, either from others or towards your own needs.\n\n### 2. Knight of Swords\n![Knight of Swords](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Swords12.jpg)\nThe Knight of Swords represents aggressive energy and action. It can indicate situations where trust might be challenged due to rushed decisions or impulsive actions. This card advises caution against hasty judgments that might lead to betrayal or misunderstandings. It reminds you to consider the consequences of your actions, especially when they are driven by strong emotions or urgent demands.\n\nTogether, these cards suggest a balance between the caring and proactive aspects of trust. The Empress encourages a nurturing approach to relationships, fostering trust through care and protection, while the Knight of Swords warns of the potential for betrayal if actions are not thought through carefully. Trust is built on understanding and patience, and betrayal often comes from neglect or rash behavior."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

No matter what demands are being placed on you currently, you need to replenish yourself. Not wanting to disappoint others makes us jump through impossible circles and hoops, attempting to be Superman or Superwoman. All the while, we slowly deplete ourselves to the point where we need rescuing! Temperance gently guides you to protect your own health and well-being first. In this way, you will have plenty to share with others. To restore your balance, what is your body signaling that it needs? More water? More rest? Some quiet time? A vacation? A break? Time with your favorite books? A reading. Wrap yourself in the Angel&#x27;s wings and lovingly give your body some attention. The Angel of Temperance is guiding you back toward what you need for balance. Taking the time to restore your equilibrium will ensure that you have an abundance of energy to invest in all the people, goals, and improvements that are waiting for you.&quot;},\n  &#x27;reversed&#x27;: {&#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Temperance Reversed&#x27;,\n   &#x27;message&#x27;: &quot;If Temperance appears reversed, it signifies depletion and a need for restoration.

The Angel on the card symbolizes the need to surrender current stress to the Divine. You are being called back to reconnect with what is personally sacred to you. The imagery of flowing water on the card signifies the healing properties of water. An easy way to restore equilibrium is to give your body more water. This will do wonders for your mood and energy level. Perhaps it&#x27;s time to reconnect with the bodies of water in nature.

Your personal energy field needs to be cleared to move forward at this time. If you find yourself excessively doing one thing, shift your energy to focusing on another aspect of your life that would benefit from your attention. Know that where you are today is just where you need to be. Be okay with areas of your life being works in progress.

Porter and Mark R. Kramer make the case that foundations and other philanthropic organizations need to fundamentally rethink their approach in order to maximize the social impact and value created by their charitable giving. The principal argument put forth by Porter and Kramer is that philanthropists should take a more strategic, results-oriented approach modeled after how businesses operate, rather than simply making donations to worthy causes in a scattershot fashion.\n\nSpecifically, they argue that foundations need to shift from an emphasis on &quot;grantmaking&quot; - passively awaiting grant proposals and choosing among them - to a focus on &quot;value creation&quot; - proactively identifying the best opportunities for social impact and structuring their giving to deliver concrete, measurable results (Porter &amp; Kramer, 1999, p.122). This involves foundations developing a clear strategic focus, conducting research to identify and analyze opportunities for impact, working closely with grant recipients as hands-on partners, and rigorously measuring and evaluating outcomes. \n\nPorter and Kramer assert that by taking such a strategic, value-driven approach, foundations can leverage their resources to spark meaningful social progress and systemic change, rather than just ameliorating problems on the margins. They write: &quot;By using its dollars as an investment in superior problem-solving capabilities and measuring success by the value it creates, a foundation converts its grants from a passive resource transfer to a powerful asset for social change&quot; (Porter &amp; Kramer, 1999, p.126). In other words, philanthropists can and should play the role of strategic social investor, not just charitable donor.\n\nUnderpinning Porter and Kramer&#x27;s argument is the belief that the tools, techniques and mindset that have allowed businesses and private markets to generate immense wealth can be applied to the social sector to create significant advances. Just as venture capitalists and CEOs seek to maximize return on investment and shareholder value, philanthropic leaders should focus their energies and resources on the opportunities that will yield the greatest social value and progress per dollar spent. This represents a major philosophical shift for an industry traditionally driven more by soft-hearted altruism than hard-nosed analytics. \n\nWhile acknowledging the fundamental differences between the private and non-profit sectors, Porter and Kramer ultimately make a persuasive case that philanthropists have much to gain by embracing key business best practices around strategy, focus, measurement, and continuous improvement in service of maximizing social impact. Their article helped sparked a still-ongoing movement to reinvent philanthropy for the 21st century along more results-oriented lines.\n\nPart B: The Relationship Between Development and Fundraising\n\nDevelopment and fundraising are two closely intertwined but distinct activities that are critical to the financial health and sustainability of non-profit organizations. While there is some overlap between the two functions, they each play vital and complementary roles. Put simply, development is about building long-term relationships and laying the groundwork for ongoing support, while fundraising is the process of actually soliciting and securing donations and grants. \n\nDevelopment refers to the ongoing efforts of a non-profit to engage donors and funders, cultivate relationships, communicate impact, and position the organization as a worthy investment (Worth, 2019). This includes things like donor stewardship and recognition, crafting compelling case statements and grant proposals, holding informational events, securing media coverage, publishing annual reports, and engaging the community. The goal of development is to build a strong reputation, tell the organization&#x27;s story, demonstrate value, and grow a loyal base of supporters over time.\n\nFundraising, on the other hand, is the more immediate task of asking supporters to give money and close the deal on donations or grants. This covers tactics like online and mail solicitation campaigns, fundraising events, face-to-face asks, phone-a-thons, crowdfunding drives, and grant applications. Successful fundraising requires compelling messaging, persistence, strong closing skills, and increasingly, data-driven segmentation and targeting of donors (Sargeant &amp; Jay, 2014). The money raised through fundraising allows the non-profit to fund its operating budget and programs.\n\nSo in essence, development is about sowing seeds and tending the garden, while fundraising is about harvesting the crop. The two go hand-in-hand - effective development makes fundraising easier by supplying a steady stream of warm prospects and grant opportunities, while fundraising provides the revenue that enables the organization to grow, thrive, and deliver on the vision communicated through its development efforts. \n\nIn my role, I plan to deploy a range of development tactics to position our organization as a high-impact agent of social change and lay the groundwork for successful fundraising. This will include:\n\nDeveloping powerful messaging and stories that showcase our outcomes and value proposition\nProactively identifying and building relationships with high-potential individual and institutional funders aligned with our mission\nLeveraging data to segment and target donors and personalize outreach \nProviding outstanding stewardship to retain donors and grow their giving over time\nMaintaining a steady drumbeat of external communications through our website, newsletter, PR, and events \nPartnering closely with program staff to gather stories, data and examples that demonstrate our impact\nCollaborating with the fundraising team to align our efforts and equip them for success\nBy taking a strategic, donor-centric approach to development, we can build a strong foundation for long-term fundraising success and growth. Delivering value to funders and compellingly communicating that value is the key to securing the partnerships and resources needed to power our mission forward.\n\nPart C: You Don&#x27;t Need Billions to Be a Philanthropist\n\nDavid Rubenstein is right - being a great philanthropist doesn&#x27;t require great wealth. Each of us, regardless of financial means, has the capacity to make a positive difference in the lives of others and our communities. Philanthropy at its essence is about the love of humanity and giving of ourselves to help make the world a little bit better. While wealthy mega-donors like Rubenstein understandably get the lion&#x27;s share of attention, the true lifeblood of philanthropy is the collective impact of millions of ordinary people contributing their time, talent and resources in ways large and small. \n\nI may never have the means to acquire historic artifacts or monuments, but I absolutely have the ability to be philanthropic and generous within my sphere of influence. One way I strive to do this is by being generous with my skills and expertise. As an individual with a passion for social impact, I frequently donate my services to help resource-strapped non-profits craft compelling grant proposals, fundraising appeals, web copy, and other materials. Providing pro bono support for causes I care about deeply is extremely fulfilling and a great way to give back.\n\nI&#x27;m also a big believer in the power of volunteering. Spending a Saturday morning working at the local food bank, mentoring at-risk youth, building a home with Habitat for Humanity, or phone banking for a candidate or cause not only makes a tangible difference, but connects us to our community and keeps us grounded. The non-profit sector simply couldn&#x27;t function without millions of volunteers willing to donate their sweat equity. Volunteering also tends to lead to financial giving down the road - when we invest our time in an organization, we&#x27;re more apt to open our wallets as well. \n\nSpeaking of financial giving, I&#x27;m a big proponent of donors at all levels taking a thoughtful, intentional approach to their philanthropy, regardless of whether they&#x27;re giving $5 or $5 million. One powerful framework is &quot;effective altruism,&quot; which involves using data and reason to determine how to do the absolute most good per dollar donated (MacAskill, 2016). So instead of just giving to whatever random causes cross our radar, we can research and direct our giving to the organizations and interventions that have the highest demonstrable impact in reducing suffering, saving lives, educating kids, protecting the planet, etc. Even small donations, carefully targeted, can have an outsized impact.\n\nBeyond giving money, time and skills, we can all be philanthropists simply by living our values and being caring members of our community. Treating all people with respect and compassion, being a positive role model for kids, supporting minority-owned businesses, reducing our environmental footprint, amplifying important causes on social media - there are countless ways we can make the world a little brighter through our everyday actions and choices. As the author Herman Melville once wrote, &quot;We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men&quot; (Melville, 1951). Recognizing and strengthening those connections is what philanthropy is ultimately all about.\n\nSo while I may not be able to single-handedly solve society&#x27;s greatest challenges, I absolutely have the power - and responsibility - to give of myself for the greater good. If we all embraced this mindset and did our part, the positive impact would be immeasurable. Because as Winston Churchill famously said, &quot;We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give&quot; (Churchill, 1963). Here&#x27;s to a life of generosity, in ways big and small.\n\nAs David Rubenstein&#x27;s example illustrates, philanthropy comes in many forms. For some, it may mean writing big checks to save historic artifacts or endow academic institutions. For others, it&#x27;s volunteering at a local school, donating professional services, or simply being a kind and engaged member of the community. The common thread is a commitment to looking beyond our own self-interest and proactively finding ways to be of service. \n\nUltimately, being a great philanthropist boils down to cultivating a generous spirit, recognizing our shared humanity, and taking consistent action - within our means - to uplift others and leave the world a little better than we found it. Each of us has something valuable to give, whether time, talent, treasure, or simply our compassion. And in the end, that&#x27;s really what philanthropy is all about - lovingly sharing what we have to help meet the needs of our fellow travelers on this journey of life.\n\nWhile it&#x27;s easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer scale and complexity of the challenges we face as a society, we must never underestimate the power of individual contributions aggregated over time. Seemingly small acts of generosity, when multiplied by millions of people, can have a staggering cumulative impact. So whatever form our philanthropy takes, the key is to just start giving and trust that our efforts are making a meaningful difference, even if we can&#x27;t always see it directly. \n\nTo paraphrase the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, few of us will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events for the better. And in the total of all those acts will be written the history of a generation (Kennedy, 1966). By striving to be philanthropists in ways large and small, we can each do our part to author a more compassionate, equitable and hopeful future for all. That is a legacy well worth pursuing.\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\nChurchill, W. (1963).

Their perspective on transforming foundations into proactive, results-oriented entities highlights a critical shift in maximizing social impact. This emphasis on strategic philanthropy is particularly pertinent in today&#x27;s world, where the complexity of social issues demands more than just financial contributions; it requires thoughtful, data-driven interventions that can lead to sustainable change.\n\nOne central idea you touched upon is the concept of &quot;value creation&quot; in philanthropy. This approach is indeed revolutionary as it borrows heavily from business principles to enhance the effectiveness of charitable efforts. The notion that foundations should act more like venture capitalists, seeking to maximize social returns on investment, aligns well with the principles of &quot;effective altruism&quot; as discussed by MacAskill (2016). Effective altruism also advocates for using evidence and reason to ensure that donations are making the most significant possible impact. This shared emphasis on measurement and strategic investment underscores a growing trend in philanthropy toward more rigorous and accountable practices.\n\nI appreciate how you linked this strategic approach to your personal experiences and beliefs in part C. Your commitment to using your skills for pro bono work and volunteering exemplifies the broader point that meaningful philanthropy does not always require vast financial resources. Instead, it often hinges on the thoughtful application of one&#x27;s time and talents. Given your insights and experiences, what are some specific challenges you foresee in implementing a strategic, results-oriented approach in smaller nonprofit organizations? How might these organizations overcome these challenges to enhance their impact?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Describe why\nthese are important and relate and apply the three dimensions to your learning from earlier modules.\n\nDifferent from the life cycle format we were taught as children, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) incorporates a variety of subjects. The LCA method is a standardized system-based set of tools that evaluate environmental impacts and evaluates products systems. The LCA is applicable when assessing the systems of environmental and sustainability. It was not historically developed to evaluate other sustainability dimensions like economic and social factors so recent challenges in LCA have led to a broadening outlook of its processes. This means LCA now encompasses other dimensions which has resulted in what is now called the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA). LCSA needs to be systemwide, integrated, and interdisciplinary analysis over time so a modeling tool can simulate and analyze the inter-relationships between social, ecological, and economic systems (Cihat Onat, N., et al, 2017). \n\nWhen utilizing Life Cycle Assessment, Life Cycle Costing, and Social Life Cycle Assessment, it is possible to objectively determine where materials are environmentally friendly. These methods also provide us with the ability to understand which materials only appear to be safe for our environment. These methods are important when trying to understand how the activities of companies that produce the goods we consume affect the world around us. They also help us understand how the life cycle of a product impacts the environment throughout its life cycle. Most of this seems familiar to previous readings, especially when considering the human well-being is a central concept to the LCSA. Businesses do not want to be associated with poor working conditions, child labor, or corruption at any stage of their operations. Nic Marks has many titles but one of his titles is statistician. He broke down various metrics that show that the hippiness of a country\u2019s citizens should be more highly valued when trying to create a happy planet. The Happy Planet Index is the first global measure of sustainable well-being which envisions a future where good lives don&#x27;t have to cost the earth (Marks, N., 2010).\n\n\nPart 2: What indicators are required to assess the systems dynamics of flow-limited resources? What inputs might be incorporated\ninto a model of flow-limited resources? How is this different from stock-limited resources? Provide an example of the systems\ndynamics of:\n\u25cf A stock-limited resource (such as cobalt)\n\u25cf A flow-limited resource (such as rabbits)\nDescribe what and how you would measure the inputs, outputs and feedback loops (in-flow, out-flow, connectors or dependencies,\nstocks and sources or sinks) in each example. Keep it simple (i.e., bamboo production for chairs). You don\u2019t have to do the\nmathematical calculations, just describe the systems process. (If you want to take it further, you can use Stella Online Modeling, linked\nabove)\n\n \n\n\u201cEcological, geochemical and human processes can be described by following the flows of material or energy from one place or form to another. A &quot;system&quot; is any set of connected processes and quantities of resources. It can be as larger or as small as you want to set the boundaries around. Although some people use the term &quot;systems approach&quot; to be holistic and inclusive, our use of the word &quot;systems view&quot; specifies a set of intellectual tools that can be applied to any size set of processes and resources.\u201d - Reuter, J. (2013)\n\nAs someone who is slightly overwhelmed by numbers and equations, I felt more at ease after watching Andrew Jones\u2019 video of simplified diagrams of Stocks and Flow. The stocks and flows diagram is useful when measuring inflows, stocks, and outflows of anything that needs to be quantified. It can be applied to anything that needs to be measured. Whether it be people, a resource, or a product, the diagram helps keep track of the units being measured (Jones, A., 2015).\n\n\nStocks: measured in units (i.e., Gallons, Population, Weight)\nFlows: Change the levels of stocks. Measured PER time (i.e. Gallons per day, People per month, Ton per year)\nInformation flows: Inflow and Outflow\nConvertors/Constants: what changes and what stays the same\nSource/Sink: an unlimited, unchanging concentration or a reservoir that is outside the boundaries of the system that we are studying\nA stock flow diagram shows the parts of a system and how those parts affect one another. It creates a visual representation of how a system works. Stocks, or accumulations, are identified with the box in the center of the diagram. The inflow and outflow can fluctuate based on their flows or rates of change. One reason this tool is so useful in building an understanding is how it shifts focus away from the characters in the system and instead seeing those characters as part of a larger accumulation. Accumulations are all around us. This can be a plant in a field, a product in a warehouse, and sometimes they can go unnoticed because they are visibly there. Changing the flows can also change the stocks.\n\nRenewable resources are often flow-limited, meaning there\u2019s only so much available at one time. An example of this are renewable resources like wind and solar but these are only available when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. A stock-limited resource can be fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are the product of a finite stock of a transformed organic material. This organic matter was created in specific eras and regions, and cannot be replenished once extracted and consumed.\n\n\nExample: Water retention in a dam\n\nInflow: Rainwater\nStock: Amount of Water in the Dam\nOutflow: Overflow/Excessive rainwater\nVariable 1: Ice Melt\nVariable 2: Water Needed for Agriculture/Human Population\n\nIn California, there has been an extensive drought that lasted several years. Due to the massive amounts of rain from recent storms, drought-like conditions have been reduced and our damns our full. This have given the residents, wildlife, and the agriculture industry a much-needed breather from the hardships caused by the lack of water in our state. There are only a few areas in California that are considered abnormally dry but there is no longer a drought (NIDIS, 2024). Considering warmer weather is already here, with a high of 89 degrees in Fresno today, the ice melt will only cause the water levels to rise within the dams. With capacities reaching their limits, there will be a need to release excess water. This will cause a drop in stock within the dam but there will be a large inflow of water due to warming weather. This may not be a bad situation as there will likely be no rain in the coming months and many farmers throughout the state will require more water during the hot summer months.\n\n\nResources:\n\n Cihat Onat, N., Kucukvar, M., Halog, A., &amp; Cloutier, S.

The traditional capitalist focus on profit maximization often overlooks the social and environmental costs of production. By contrast, an integrated LCSA framework can help ensure that these externalities are accounted for, promoting a more sustainable and just economic system.

Describe why these are important and relate and apply the three dimensions to your learning from earlier modules.\n\n In Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA), the three dimensions of improvement typically suggested are environmental, economic, and social. \n\nEnvironmental Dimension - This dimension focuses on reducing the negative impacts on the environment throughout the product&#x27;s lifecycle, from raw material extraction to disposal. It includes aspects such as resource use, emissions, waste, and ecological impact. In earlier modules, I learned about environmental impact, carbon footprints, pollution control, and resource management. Applying this dimension involves integrating these concepts into a holistic assessment to minimize environmental harm.\n\nEconomic Dimension - The economic dimension considers the costs and benefits associated with the lifecycle of a product or process. It includes direct and indirect costs, as well as economic benefits such as job creation and economic growth. Previous learning covered cost-benefit analysis, economic feasibility, and market dynamics. This dimension is applied by ensuring that sustainability measures are economically viable and contribute to overall economic welfare without incurring excessive costs.\n\nSocial Dimension - This aspect examines the social implications related to a product or service over its entire life cycle. It includes factors such as labor rights, community impacts, health and safety, and overall well-being. The social dimension is vital because it ensures that environmental and economic sustainability efforts do not adversely affect the community or stakeholders involved. It promotes fairness, equity, and quality of life for all parties impacted by the life cycle of a product or service. Past modules focused on social issues and community development. These explored how projects or policies can be designed and implemented in a way that they contribute positively to the social fabric of communities, enhance social inclusion, and improve quality of life.\n\nPart 2: What indicators are required to assess the systems dynamics of flow-limited resources? What inputs might be incorporated into a model of flow-limited resources?\n\nIndicators for Assessing Flow-Limited Resources\n\nResource Availability - Measures the total available quantity of the resource over time, considering natural replenishment rates and depletion.\n\nExtraction Rate - The speed at which the resource is being extracted or harvested, which impacts sustainability and availability.\n\nConsumption Rate - How quickly the resource is being consumed. This is important for understanding the demand dynamics.\n\nRenewal or Regeneration Rate - Specific to renewable resources, indicating how quickly a resource can replenish itself naturally.\n\n Efficiency of Use - Indicates how efficiently the resource is utilized in processes, which can help in identifying areas for improvement to reduce waste.\n\nLeakages - Tracks losses of resources during extraction, processing, transportation, and usage, which affect overall sustainability.\n\nDependency Ratio - Assesses the extent to which a system or economy depends on the particular flow-limited resource, highlighting vulnerability to shortages.\n\nInputs for Modeling Flow-Limited Resources\n\nHistorical Data - Past data on resource extraction, consumption rates, and availability to establish trends and variability.\n\n Economic Factors - Pricing, market demand, and economic growth forecasts, which influence consumption and extraction rates.\n\nTechnological Changes - Innovations that affect the efficiency of resource extraction and utilization.\n\nPolicy and Regulatory Frameworks - Government regulations regarding resource extraction and use, which can alter practices significantly.\n\n Environmental Conditions - Climate and ecological factors that can affect the natural replenishment rates of renewable resources.\n\nSocial Dynamics - Population growth, cultural attitudes towards resource consumption, and changes in consumer behavior.\n\nThese inputs and indicators, when incorporated into a systems dynamics model, can help simulate different scenarios and make predictions about the sustainability and availability of flow-limited resources. Such models are crucial for effective planning and management, especially in contexts where resources are critical to the economy and the environment.\n\nHow is this different from stock-limited resources?\n\n Flow-limited resources, like water or forests, replenish naturally over time, so managing them focuses on ensuring that we don&#x27;t use them faster than they can renew. In contrast, stock-limited resources such as fossil fuels and minerals do not naturally replenish within human lifespans and once depleted, they are gone forever.\n\nTherefore, managing these resources centers on conserving what we have, using them efficiently, and finding alternatives.\n\nFor flow-limited resources, models assess how fast the resource renews and the impacts of consumption patterns, while for stock-limited resources, models focus on the total available amount and how quickly it&#x27;s being used up.\n\n \n\nProvide an example of the systems dynamics of  a stock-limited resource and flow-limited resource.\n\n Example of stock-limited resource\n\nSystems Dynamics Model of Gold Mining in the Philippines\n\nGold production in the Philippines has seen a decrease over recent years, indicating potential concerns about the sustainability and availability of this resource. Between 2022 and 2026, the production is expected to continue declining at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.28%, following a previous five-year trend of a 4.19% annual decrease. This trend suggests that gold may be a stock-limited resource in the Philippines, facing challenges such as depletion and increased extraction costs (Mining Technology, 2023).\n\nStock Assessment:\nInitial Stock: Estimate the total amount of gold reserves available in the Philippines.\nExtraction Rate: Calculate how much gold is mined annually. This affects the depletion of the initial stock.\nEconomic Dynamics:\nMarket Demand: Analyze global and local demand for gold, influenced by factors like economic stability, investment trends, and industrial use.\nGold Prices: Monitor fluctuations in gold prices, which can influence mining efforts. Higher prices might drive increased mining activity, accelerating stock depletion.\nEconomic Contribution: Evaluate how much gold mining contributes to the local and national economy, including job creation and GDP.\nEnvironmental and Social Impact:\nEnvironmental Degradation: Assess the environmental impacts of gold mining, such as deforestation, water pollution, and soil erosion.\nCommunity Impact: Consider the effects on local communities, including displacement, health impacts due to pollution, and economic benefits.\nRegulatory Framework:\nMining Policies: Include government regulations and policies that control mining activities, enforce environmental protections, and ensure benefits to local communities.\nSustainability Initiatives: Model the impact of initiatives aimed at reducing environmental damage and promoting sustainable mining practices.\nFeedback Loops:\nResource Depletion and Mining Intensity: As gold stocks decrease, the effort and cost to extract gold may increase, potentially leading to a reduction in mining activities or shifts to more efficient or alternative mining technologies.\nEconomic and Environmental Feedback: Economic benefits from mining can fund environmental restoration projects, but negative environmental impacts can also lead to stricter regulations that might reduce mining outputs.\nApplication\n\nThis model would help policymakers and mining companies in the Philippines make informed decisions by predicting long-term outcomes based on current practices. It can show the balance between economic benefits from gold mining and the costs of environmental and social impacts. By adjusting variables like mining rates or implementing new policies, the model can simulate different future scenarios, guiding sustainable resource management strategies.\n\nExample of flow-limited resource\n\nSystems Dynamics Model of Squid Fishing\n\nOverfishing and ineffective marine reserve management are significant issues that compromise the sustainability of marine biodiversity, including fish communities. Effective community-based management has been suggested as a solution to improve biomass and species diversity within marine reserves, demonstrating the importance of local enforcement and proper governance structures to combat overfishing and enhance fishery sustainability (Muallil et al., 2019).\n\nPopulation Dynamics:\nPopulation Size: Estimate the initial population of squid in a specific marine area. This population can replenish annually based on biological factors like breeding success and juvenile survival rates.\nNatural Growth Rate: Calculate the natural rate at which the squid population grows, influenced by environmental conditions and predation levels.\nFishing Activity:\nFishing Intensity: Track how much squid is harvested each year, which directly reduces the population size.\nFishing Regulations: Include policies like quotas, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions that are designed to control the amount of squid caught, ensuring the population remains sustainable.\nEconomic Factors:\nMarket Demand: Assess the demand for squid in markets, both local and international, which can drive the intensity of fishing activities.\nEconomic Value: Evaluate the economic importance of squid fishing to local communities and the broader economy, considering how changes in squid population affect livelihoods.\nEnvironmental and Ecological Impact:\nEcosystem Interactions: Consider the role of squid within the marine ecosystem, including their relationships with predators and prey.\nEnvironmental Changes: Factor in how changes in water temperature, pollution, and other environmental factors can affect squid populations and their habitat.\nFeedback Loops:\nResource Depletion and Fishing Effort: As the squid population decreases, if fishing efforts are not adjusted, this could lead to overfishing and further depletion. Conversely, a healthy squid population might encourage increased fishing effort.\nRegulatory Response: Changes in squid population dynamics might lead to adjustments in fishing regulations, aiming to balance economic needs with conservation goals.\nApplication\n\nThis model would be useful for marine biologists, conservationists, and policymakers to simulate different scenarios of squid fishing and its impacts. By adjusting variables such as fishing rates or market demand, the model can predict how these factors might affect the squid population over time. This helps in crafting strategies that ensure the sustainability of the squid population, supporting both the ecosystem and the economic activities dependent on it.\n\n \n\n References:\n\nReuter, J.

One central idea you highlight is the importance of integrating environmental, economic, and social dimensions within LCSA. This multi-faceted approach is critical for a comprehensive understanding of sustainability impacts. The necessity of addressing social implications, as noted in your post, underscores the broader need for equitable resource management practices, which can help mitigate the adverse effects often perpetuated by capitalist frameworks.\n\nYour discussion on cooperative resource management practices, particularly in the context of flow-limited resources like water, aligns with contemporary scholarship emphasizing community-based approaches. Muallil et al. (2019) illustrate how community-based management can significantly improve biomass and species diversity within marine reserves. This model showcases how local governance and active community participation can lead to more sustainable and equitable resource use. Cooperative management not only enhances environmental outcomes but also ensures that marginalized communities, often overlooked in capitalist systems, have a voice and stake in resource allocation.\n\nGiven the potential benefits of such cooperative models, I am curious about your thoughts on how these principles could be more broadly applied within LCSA practices. Specifically, how do you envision integrating community-based management strategies into the assessment of stock-limited resources like gold? Do you think such an approach could address some of the social and environmental issues associated with traditional extractive industries, and if so, how?\n\nReference:\nMuallil, R. N., et al.

Foundation impact should be evaluated based on the impact of its grant recipients as it demonstrates the social return on their investment. Since foundations are acting as a middleman between donors and nonprofits, a substantial portion of the funding is leveraged for administrative costs rather than going to nonprofits. Because of this, it&#x27;s important that foundations are generating additional value that support the increased administrative costs.\n\nPart B\n\nThe Fundraising Report Card describes a development professional as &quot;a person who creates the systems and processes required for a nonprofit organization to sustain itself financially...Fundraisers ask for money. Development professionals create financially sustainable organizations. Fundraisers are development professionals.&quot;\n\nWhile this discusses the role more than the field, I found that it aligns with my personal experience in both fields. I worked in development for a nonprofit were we cultivated relationships with donors and ensure we had a development plan based on future grants and planned giving that aligned with our upcoming work. When I worked in fundraising, we focused on mail and digital fundraising campaigns to individual donors who received little more than a thank you and a trinket based on the gift they provide. Development focused on long-term relationships with key donors and foundations while fundraising is extremely transactional.\n\nPart C\n\nIn addition to Rubenstein&#x27;s comment, Kwee discussed philanthropy as she said: &quot;Giving is a lot more than just money. It&#x27;s time. It&#x27;s loving your neighbor. It&#x27;s person to person and offering of even our skills&quot; (TedxTalks, 2015). I consider myself to be a philanthropist based on my engagement with my community through volunteer work and individual donations. I strive to create environmental impact by reducing my use of single use plastic and recycling in creative ways. I try to purchase from socially conscious companies that align with my values and support similar causes. I donate to various causes and volunteer for a variety of causes.\n\n \n\nResources\n\nPorter, M., &amp; Kramer, M. (1999, November 1). Philanthropy\u2019s new agenda: Creating value.

This nuanced understanding is essential for creating financially sustainable nonprofit organizations. Indeed, the emphasis on strategic relationship-building in development is akin to cooperative resource allocation principles, which prioritize equitable distribution and long-term community benefits. This approach provides a thoughtful counterbalance to the short-term, profit-driven focus of capitalist systems, often neglecting the broader social impacts (Porter &amp; Kramer, 1999).

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings. Consider the the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge,which raised money for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s\nDisease research.The initiative occasioned snickers and sniping from some professional\n\nphilanthropists, but donations it generated led to a major scientific breakthrough at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and pre-funding of clinical trials for new therapies.\n\nThere are many more examples. Crusades against autism by Bernie Marcus,against prostate cancer by\nMichael Milken, and against breast cancer by Nancy Brinker were all thought quixotic when they kicked\n\noff, yet each paid huge dividends. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute, and Markey fellowships would never have seen the light of day if many professionals\n\nhad had their way. And it was support from the Guggenheim family that allowed physicist Robert\nGoddard to overcome scorn from other scientists and ridicule by the New York Times to become the\n\ngenius of rocketry and father of America&#x27;s success in space.\n\nAmerica&#x27;s strong system of decentralized giving and homegrown problem-solving supports wide\n\nexperimentation and avoids putting all of our eggs in one national basket.\n\n5. Philanthropic aid lacks standardization! It&#x27;s a chaotic patchwork!\n\nThe lesson of the Internet is the accumulated power of millions of small actions. The story of today&#x27;s\n\nhacker culture is that one individual with a laptop can do astonishing things.Small-scale action that\nlacks uniformity should not be considered a failing.It&#x27;s not chaos,it&#x27;s crowdsourcing\u2014hordes of\neveryday people taking lots of small bites at a problem and eventually chewing through even very big\nissues.\n\nThere are rich examples of the power of dispersed decision-making throughout biology and across\nhuman history. Many of our most effective charities discovered the power of decentralization\ngenerations ago. Each of the I,4oo local chapters of Habitat for Humanity, for example,are independent\n\n3/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nentities with their own rules, practices, and funding. All of the 164 regional branches of Goodwill have\ntheir own boards of directors, and are autonomous in policy and funding; the central office is tiny\ncompared to working affiliates in cities like Milwaukee and Houston.And the Appalachian Mountain\nClub efficiently maintains thousands of miles of hiking trails through a network of local branches\n\nThis same principle of accomplishing important tasks through loosely coupled teams or networks of\nindependent actors is also a powerful trend in many of today&#x27;s most successful private businesses. Every\n\nUber city in America has different fares,different products, different practices. Philanthropy can be\nproud of having been a pioneer in solving problems via a flexible ecosystem of participants, rather than\n\nby following standardized formulas.\n\n6. Charity may work for individuals, but what we really need are solutions that benefit entire groups!\n\nAmbitious people may look at the \u201cone soul at a time&quot; model prevalent in philanthropy and conclude\nthat it&#x27;s just too slow. But that perspective misunderstands what social reclamation usually requires. For\n\ntough problems like addiction and recidivism, the most successful solutions rely heavily on one-to-one\nhuman accountability. They take advantage of the useful information available when we actually know\n\nsomeone, instead of dealing with a stranger. By creating personal instead of impersonal transactions, we\n\ncan wield the power of relationships to teach and change behavior.\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to romanticize the &quot;consistency&quot; of government programs, and contrast it favorably to the\ncrazy-quilt of individualized variations in charitable aid, but consistency is not really how humans work.\nIf you have one child who needs a very structured environment and another who blooms when left to\n\nnavigate on her own, you don&#x27;t want one-size-fits-all schools; you want individualized services that\nrecognize and work with intimate differences of personality. You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding that in\ngovernment-run programs, but it&#x27;s a hallmark of philanthropic efforts.\n\nBen Franklin was one of the first donors to argue that philanthropy shouldn&#x27;t just transfer funds in an\n\nattempt to relieve men in their misfortune. It should help build up individuals into a healthier state.\n\nThe goal of charitable aid in the United States has always been individual competence and\n\nindependence\u2014not just social quiet. And this often requires a personal touch, real mentoring, and one-\non-one aid of the sort many philanthropic efforts emphasize.\n\n7. Philanthropy is undemocratic!\n\n4/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nSome critics,especially from the left,complain that donors accumulate too much power and that their\nmoney lets them impose their point of view on society. But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year. Measured against the $36o billion of cash that\nAmericans donate annually, and nearly that much more in the value of volunteered time,Gates\nFoundation commands less than I percent of our annual philanthropy. That is not an unhealthy\n\nconcentration of power.\n\nAmerican philanthropy is also diverse and diffuse. Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing. Philanthropy is not\njust a sign of self-rule,but also a source  of it\u2014a kind of nursery for broader loyalties to one&#x27;s fellow\n\ncitizens. A healthy democracy should encourage,not discourage,people from acting on their own to\n\nimprove what they judge to be the common good.\n\n8 .  Only government can lead important social change in a fair way!\n\nHistory tells a different story. Private donors and volunteers created the first schools,missions, colleges,\n\nand apprenticeships for Indians and African Americans,often in the face of state resistance.At the\n\nsame time government was enforcing Jim Crow laws,philanthropist Julius Rosenwald erected 4,977\n\nrural schools across America&#x27;s black belt. At the time of his death, 27 percent of all African American\n\nchildren in the United States were educated in one of the schools he built\n\n5/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThose who view such examples as ancient history and believe that all necessary reforms now flow from\ngovernment are gravely mistaken. According to the UCLA Civil Rights Project, America&#x27;s most\n\nsegregated and often most inadequate government-run schools are all in northern cities with activist\n\ngovernments: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In fact,the country&#x27;s\n\nmost segregated schools are in New York state, thanks to New York City, where the proportion of\n\nschools in which at least go percent of the students are black or Hispanic rose sharply from 1989 to\n2OIO.\n\nIt is private philanthropy that is shaking up New York City&#x27;s complacent educational establishment\ntoday by launching charter schools. There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J. Paul Getty, Leland Stanford,\nRussell Sage, and John MacArthur were known to exhibit shabby behavior. (Stanford, for example,\n\nemployed stock watering, kickbacks,bribery, and collusion.) Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints. Adam Smith taught us that\nfreely conducted commerce can take normal human behaviors\u2014including ugly and mercenary on es -\nand turn them to broadly productive uses.The same is true in the world of philanthropy.Part of the\nmagic of America&#x27;s charitable structure is that it can convert common human impulses into truth,\nuplift, and beauty for all of society.\n\nIo . Philanthropy distracts people who ought to focus on business!\n\nThe right side of the political spectrum sometimes complains that philanthropy drags too many\nproductive business people into do-gooding,distracting them from creating the commercial bounty that\n\n6/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nsociety counts on. But there are reasons to think that philanthropy actually strengthens capitalism.\n\nEconomists Zoltan Acs and Ronnie Phillips have observed that the United States has a distinctive\n\nmeans of \u201creconstituting\u201d wealth via philanthropy.\u201cPhilanthropy is part of the implicit social contract\nthat continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity,&quot; they write. Researchers Tino and Nima\nSanandaji agree that the \u201clegitimacy of American capitalism has in part been upheld through voluntary\ndonations.&quot; They note that &quot;much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to society.\n\nThis has had several feedback effects on capitalism. For one, the practice has limited the rise of new\ndynasties. Another positive feedback mechanism is that the donations to research and higher education\nhave allowed new generations to become wealthy?\n\nII. Philanthropy encourages collective thinking, collective responsibility, and collective action\u2014\nultimately leading to more government!\n\nThis is another concern sometimes launched from the libertarian right, where observers argue that\n\nwhat American society really needs is more individual responsibility, not more giveaways. However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate.

Porter and Mark R. Kramer\n\nFrom the Magazine (November-December 1999)\n\nDuring the past two decades,the number of charitable\nfoundations in the United States has doubled,while the value of\ntheir assets has increased more than 1,100%.Foundations now\nhold over $330 billion in assets and contribute over $20 billion\nannually to educational, humanitarian,and cultural\norganizations of all kinds. No other country in the world can\nclaim such substantial and widespread commitment to\nphilanthropy and volunteerism. But are we, as a society realizing\nthe full fruits of this commitment?\n\nGrant-giving foundations are intermediaries between the\nindividual donors who fund them and the various social\nenterprises that they, in turn, support. But if foundations serve\nonly as passive middlemen, as mere conduits for giving, then they\nfall far short of their potential and of society&#x27;s high expectations.\n\nFoundations can and should lead social progress. They have the\npotential to make more effective use of scarce resources than\neither individual donors or the government. Free from political\npressures,foundations can explore new solutions to social\nproblems with an independence tha t government can never have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations Create Value in  Four Ways\n\nOne grant\nX\n\nMultiple grants\n3X-5X\n\nEntire operating budget of one organization\n\n50X-100X\n\nEntire field\n\n&gt;1,000X\n\nmillionsDollar value of resources affected by foundation activity\n\nEach successive approach leverages a foundation&#x27;s\n\nspecial assets more than the preceding one as the pool\no f  \u22ef\n\nV\n\n1. Selecting the Best Grantees.\n\nThe process of value creation here is straightforward. Like\ninvestment advisers in the business world,foundations can use\ntheir expertise to channel resources to their most productive uses\nwithin the social sector by funding organizations that are the\nmost cost effective or that address urgent or overlooked problems.\nFor example,of the many organizations that seek funding for\nprograms aimed at reducing the high school dropout rate, a\nfoundation can select the most effective one.Thus its dollar will\n\nearn a higher social return than a dollar given less knowledgeably\nby an individual donor. In this way, choosing recipients and\nallocating funds is itself a source of value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpertise to benefit from the increased tourism. The Packard\nFoundation&#x27;s grant paid for marketing consultants who taught\nCEDO how to turn  tourists  into members, creating an ongoing\nrevenue stream for CEDO far greater than the Foundation&#x27;s\n$50,000 grant.\n\nThe Echoing Green Foundation, created by venture capitalist Ed\nCohen,gives $1.4 million a year to improve the performance of the\nnonprofit sector even more broadly. It invests in social\nentrepreneurs, individuals with the drive and vision to catalyze\nsocial change. It aims to build a community of public-service\nleaders who share their experience, knowledge, and energy with\none another. To date, Echoing Green has funded more than 300\nfellows who not only pursue their own projects but also visit with\none another to share best practices. The lessons learned are\nrecorded, distributed to all grantees,and made publicly available.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, for example, the Charles and Helen Schwab\nFamily Foundation in San Mateo, California, joined with the\nPeninsula Community Foundation and the Sobrato Foundation in\na $2 million,two-year initiative to address internal issues of\nmanagement and growth at 16 local family-service agencies.\nEvery eight weeks for the life of the project, foundation staff\nmembers meet with all 16 agency directors. Management experts\nare brought in to address relevant topics. As a result of the group\ndiscussions, three of the grantees have decided that they ca\n\nThe range of ways in which foundations can assist nonprofits goes\nwell beyond making management-development grants.\nFoundations can become fully engaged partners, providing\nadvice, management assistance,access to professional service\nfirms, clout, and a host of other non-cash resources. Improving\nthe  performance of grant recipients often requires foundations to\nwork closely with grantees. It also requires the willingness to\nengage for the long term. Foundations are capable of both.\n\nn\n\n\n\noperate more efficiently if they merge,and foundation staff has\nworked closely with them to accomplish the merger. Because\ntechnology management has surfaced as a major issue, the\nfoundations have researched and funded technology needs at\nseveral of the agencies.\n\n4 .  Advancing the State of Knowledge and Practice.\n\nFoundations can create the greatest value by funding research\nand a systematic progression of projects that produce more\neffective ways to address social problems.At its best, such work\nresults in a new framework that shapes subsequent work in the\nfield-making every dollar spent by philanthropists, government,\nand other organizations more productive.\n\nWithin six years,India doubled its rice production, and Mexico,\nonce an importer of wheat, became an exporter. Nigeria and\nColombia created  their  own research institutes  modeled  on  the\nfoundations&#x27; research.  The Rockefeller Foundation subsequently\ndisseminated its results to organizations from 28 developing\ncountries. Altogether, many millions of the world&#x27;s poorest people\nbenefited from the knowledge created by those two foundations\n\nFoundations are uniquely positioned to study a field in depth.\nThey can set a new agenda and change both public sentiment and\ngovernment policy. The green revolution, for example, had its\nroots in research sponsored jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller\nFoundations in the late 1950s and early 1960s.Concerned with\nworld hunger and population growth, the two foundations\ncreated research institutes that developed new strains of wheat\nand rice tha t doubled and tripled crop output per acre.\n\n.\n\nStudies by the Carnegie Foundation have had a similarly powerful\nimpact on education in the United States over the last 95 years. In\n1904,Carnegie funded research by Abraham Flexner on the state\nof medical education, which revealed a widespread lack of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the field of education, the Philanthropic Ventures Foundation\nin Oakland, California, for example, focuses on grassroots\nfunding. In 1995, PVF created the Teacher Resource Grants\nprogram. Working within the large field of education, PVF chose a\nspecialized positioning appropriate to its small size. PVF provides\ninexpensive but badly needed classroom materials to teachers in\nits region\u2014materials that are useless if they don&#x27;t arrive quickly,\nwhen the teacher needs them.\n\nPVF notified more than 6,000 teachers that grants of up to $1,500\nwould be available for classroom materials,field trip s, or teacher\ntraining courses.(After a year of experience, PVF lowered the\nceiling to $500 per grant.) Teachers refer to the program as the\n\u201cfax-grant program\u201d because the foundation takes requests by fax,\nand then sends an answer within one hour of receipt and a check\nwithin 24 hours.\n\nSince its positioning is to help under-resourced teachers and it\nmakes thousands of small grants, the Philanthropic Ventures\nFoundation developed a no-paperwork rule, freeing teachers from\ntime-consuming grant applications.PVF finds that an elaborate\nprocess around  the receipt, investigation, consideration, and\n\nfunding of grant requests is not necessary in its chosen area.\n\nPVF is a perfect example of a foundation that tailored its activities\nto create value. Only by doing things differently from others, in a\nway that is linked tightly to what the foundation seeks to\naccomplish, can it achieve greater impact with the same grant\ndollars or enable its grantees to be more successful. Tailoring\nactivities to strategy is the way a foundation institutionalizes and\nreinforces its distinctive strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\ntyranny of the grant cycle, with barely the time to write up\npending grant requests between board meetings.

Fewer than 9% of foundations\n\n\n\nmake 75% or more of their grants in a single field, and only 5%\nfocus more than  90% of their grants in one field. Such scattered\ngiving is inconsistent with a clear strategic positioning.\n\nNor do the data suggest that many foundations are taking\nadvantage of their unique ways to create value. Among the largest\nfoundations,with assets in excess of $1 billion,each professional\nemployee handles approximately seven grants per year (and up to\n100 times as many grant requests). There are, on average, just\nthree professional employees for every field in which the\nfoundation makes grants. Staff at the largest foundations may\nwell have sufficient time and expertise to evaluate grants,but it is\nhard to see how even the most dedicated staff could have much\ntime to assist grantees.  The smaller the foundation, the more\nstretched the staff. Among the hundreds of foundations with $50\nmillion to $250 million in assets, there are five times as many\ngrants per professional,and an average of two staff members\nhandle grants in 11 unrelated fields. The smallest foundations\noften rely on the volunteer efforts of trustees, making it almost\ncertain that many decisions are reached with little formal\nevaluation at all.\n\nThose broad metrics also suggest that foundations are not using\nthe more powerful forms of value creation beyond selection.\nFoundations rarely contribute resources other than financial\nsupport. Only 2.2% of foundation grants were designated to\nimprove the grantees&#x27; performance.Ninety-five percent of all\nfoundation grants are for one year.Although one-year grants are\nsometimes awarded for several years in a row, there is little\nevidence that foundations exploit the opportunity to work more\nclosely with grantees over extended periods of time to improve\ntheir performance. Foundations, which should be able to take the\nlong view tend to focus on grant making quarter-to-quarter.\n\n\n\nFinally, while foundations express a strong interest in innovation\nand advancing the state of knowledge about society&#x27;s problems,\nvery few fund studies that  explore the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent approaches to a given problem. Only 8.8% of foundation\ngrants went to research,and most of that was in basic medical and\nscientific areas. Funding studies or data collection is rare, and\nfoundations generally see them as less desirable than current\nsocial services.\n\nInstead of funding research, many foundations seek to promote\ninnovation through seed grants that are designed to establish and\nsupport specific new programs.There is little benefit, however, in\nstarting new initiatives if they do not survive and grow. Too often\nfoundations overlook projects aimed at fostering the growth and\nreplication of new initiatives, or they fail to support the grantee\nover an appropriately long time span. They rarely do the up-front\nresearch and the postevaluation needed to ascertain if their\nprograms have been successful and have continued to thrive after\nthe initial period of seed grant support.\n\nIn some ways, however, the overall failure to evaluate the results\nof foundation grants is the most telling danger sign of all.Almost\nno money is set aside for program evaluation.Many foundations\nare ambivalent about whether funds should be spent on\nevaluation and whether assessing the performance of past grants\ncan improve future grant making. This ambivalence about\nevaluation is reinforced by the performance criteria used to judge\nfoundation staff. These tend to emphasize the paper trail of\npregrant analysis and recommendations and give little credit for\nachieving the real-world results that motivated the grant in the\nfirst place.Program evaluation,therefore, has only a downside:\nfailure risks censure, but success adds no reward.\n\n\n\nThe evaluations that do take place are often problematic in three\nways. First, they are limited to reports as to whether the money\nwas spent as intended (output evaluation);they do not attempt to\nmeasure social impact (outcome evaluation). Second,many of the\nevaluations are done by the grant recipients themselves, who\ninvariably seek further support from the foundation.How\nobjective and reliable are these reports likely to be? Third,even in\nthe few cases where the social impact of a program is measured by\nan outside consultant, it is usually assessed at the single grantee\nlevel,in isolation from the foundation&#x27;s other grants.Therefore, it\ndoes not reflect the foundation&#x27;s success in reaching its overall\ngoals.\n\nCertainly, evaluation may at times be costly and complex.But\ngiven clear goals at the outset, it is always possible. The criteria to\nevaluate a job-training program will differ from those used to\nevaluate a funding program for young artists. But meaningful\ncriteria can be established for both.\n\nConsider the San Francisco-based Roberts Enterprise\nDevelopment Fund,which focuses on creating employment for\nthe homeless and indigent. Working closely with its grantee\nRubicon Programs, REDF developed 25 criteria that not only\nmeasure the success of job-training programs but also help\nRubicon to manage the programs more effectively. In addition to\nthe most obvious criteria\u2014changes in employment stability\nwages,and job skills\u2014REDF and Rubicon found that related\nfactors such as substance abuse and even qualitative factors such\nas the trainees&#x27; own assessments of their success in reaching\npersonal goals were all meaningful measures of outcomes the\nprogram was trying to achieve.\n\nWithout evaluation, a foundation will never know whether or not\nit has been successful. The most basic premise of strategy-\nstriving for superior performance\u2014is violated if performance is\n\n\n\nnot measured.\n\nAddressing the New Agenda\n\nHow can foundations begin down the path we have outlined? A\nnumber of foundations, including those operating under the new\nrubric of venture philanthropy, are already moving in the\ndirection outlined here. But none that we have encountered has\ngone all the way. Putting these elements together into a coherent\nwhole will require developing a strategy, aligning operations with\nthat strategy, and revising the foundation&#x27;s governance so that the\nstrategy can be monitored effectively. Responsibility for such\nchange lies ultimately with the trustees and directors, who are the\nfiduciaries accountable for the use of the foundation&#x27;s (and\nsociety&#x27;s) funds.\n\nTo develop a strategy  the place to start is positioning. This always\nrequires systematic thought and research into important social\nchallenges that are not being addressed well by others. The goal is\nnot necessarily to identify the most important problem,since\nmany are important.W hat matters is how effectively the\nfou nd at ion  can  co n trib u te  to  its  so lu tion .\n\nSecond, a foundation can learn from prior efforts within its\nchosen area of funding. Do current socioeconomic trends favor\none approach over another? What are other organizations doing\nin  th e  fie ld? Can the  work  of th is  foun da tion  re in fo rce  o r\n\ncomplement theirs? Can we uncover root causes of the problem?\n\nThird,what unique strengths will enable this foundation to create\nvalue most effectively in its field? Part of the answer to this\nquestion comes from examining objectively where the foundation\nhas made the greatest impact in the past. It also comes from a\nre alist ic  assessm e n t  o f w eakne sses.\n\n\n\nScale plays an important role in the choice of strategy. A\nfoundation  needs enough  resources to pursue its particular way of\n\ncreating value.Larger foundations may well have the scale to\nwork in more than one field. If they choose to do so, each area\nmust have its own strategy and tailored operations. All\nfoundations, however, can create more value by putting a greater\nproportion of their resources to work.  This means stepping up the\nrate of giving in their chosen fields and investing a portion of\ntheir  investm ent portfolios to support their  philanthropic work.\n\nOnce the foundation has chosen a strategy, it can begin to realign\nits operations.  A foundation, like any enterprise, is a collection of\nmany activities. Each activity-how  proposals are solicited, for\nexample, and how grantees are supported\u2014must be tailored to\nthe chosen strategy  A particularly important aspect of\noperational alignment is the development of measures to help the\nfoundation know whether or not it has been successful.\n\nOperating strategically will require most foundations to rethink\ntheir governance systems. Change will be difficult in an\nenvironment where the pressure of processing grants and getting\nthe money out the door extends beyond the  staff to the\nboardroom. Today boards of all bu t the very  largest foundations\ndiscuss and approve specific grant allocations at th eir meetings.\nWithout goals or strategy, they have no way to delegate the grant\nselection process to staff and no framework through which to\nevaluate their experience.The Chicago-based Crown Foundation,\nin an effort to break this cycle, considers grant requests at only\ntwo of its quarterly board meetings each year; the other two are\nreserved for discussing policy, reviewing performance, and\nstudying issues in more depth. Boards need to move away from\nthe operating function of approving grants to focus on setting\nstrategy and evaluating outcomes.\n\n\n\nWith goals, a strategy, and evaluation mechanisms in place,staff\ncould have greater independence to make grant decisions\nthemselves on a more timely and flexible basis. At the Colorado\nTrust,the board considers and approves multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar initiatives that have clearly defined goals and a clearly\narticulated strategy  Once the board sets the  framework, program\nstaff has the authority to make individual grants for the life of the\ninitiative. Staff members, then, have greater responsibility and\nmore freedom to make decisions on individual grants, and the\nboard  has the tim e to study  the field, set overall strategies, and\nassess staff performance.\n\nFor those who care deeply about social problems and work\ntirelessly to make a difference, current foundation practices not\nonly diminish effectiveness,they inevitably reduce the\nsatisfaction that donors, staff, and trustees derive from their\nwork. Scattered funding, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with\ngrantees, and a lack of awareness of outcomes necessarily create a\ndivide between the foundation and the ultimate results of its\nwork.Acting strategically is much more difficult. But for trustees\nand staff alike, it will be far more rewarding as well.\n\nImproving the performance of philanthropy would enable\nfoundations to have a much greater impact on society.\nFoundations could play a leading role in changing the culture of\nsocial sector management.They could spearhead the evolution of\nphilanthropy from private acts of conscience into a professional\nfield. Until foundations accept their accountability to society and\nmeet their obligation to create value, they exist in a world where\nthey cannot fail.Unfortunately, they also cannot truly succeed.\nA version of this article appeared in the November-December 1999 issue of\nHarvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nMichael E.

They contend that foundations should not merely act as passive intermediaries for donations but should leverage their unique position to drive social progress by selecting the best grantees, engaging in active partnerships, advancing knowledge and practice in their fields, and using systematic evaluation to measure outcomes. By adopting these strategies, foundations can create more significant and lasting social value [(Porter &amp; Kramer, 1999)](https://hbr.org/1999/11/philanthropys-new-agenda-creating-value).\n\nTheir argument emphasizes the importance of foundations taking a proactive role in identifying and addressing social issues, akin to how businesses strategically allocate resources to maximize return on investment. This approach involves a clear strategic focus, thorough research, hands-on partnership with grantees, and rigorous measurement of results.

Porter and Kramer advocate for foundations to adopt a more proactive, strategic role that mirrors effective business practices, aiming to create significant social value rather than just distributing funds passively.

Let&#x27;s begin your adventure.\n\n---\n\nThe moon hung low in the sky, casting a silver glow over the dense forest. The night was alive with the sounds of chirping crickets and the rustling of leaves as nocturnal creatures stirred in the shadows. You stood at the edge of an ancient path, barely visible beneath the thick canopy of trees. This was no ordinary forest; it was the Whispering Woods, a place filled with magic and mystery, where legends spoke of hidden treasures and ancient guardians.\n\nYou had heard the stories all your life, tales of adventurers who entered the woods seeking fortune and glory, only to be swallowed by the forest, never to return. But you were different. You had prepared for this journey, armed with knowledge passed down through generations and a map said to be drawn by the last adventurer who made it out alive.\n\nWith a deep breath, you stepped onto the path, feeling the cool, damp earth beneath your boots. The air was thick with the scent of pine and moss, and an eerie stillness settled over the forest as if it were holding its breath, waiting to see what you would do next.\n\nAs you walked, the trees seemed to close in around you, their gnarled branches intertwining overhead to form a natural tunnel. Strange symbols carved into the bark of the trees glowed faintly, illuminating the path ahead. Your map indicated a clearing up ahead, where you hoped to find the first clue to the treasure&#x27;s location.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, you finally emerged into the clearing. Moonlight flooded the open space, revealing a stone altar in the center, surrounded by ancient runes etched into the ground. Atop the altar lay a dusty old book, its cover adorned with intricate designs and a large, shimmering gemstone.\n\nYou approached the altar cautiously, your heart pounding in your chest. The air around you felt charged with energy, as if the forest itself were watching. As you reached out to touch the book, a voice echoed through the clearing, deep and resonant, speaking in a language you did not understand.\n\nThe gemstone on the book began to glow, and the runes on the ground lit up, forming a circle of light around you. You could feel the magic pulsing through the air, a tangible force that sent shivers down your spine.\n\nWhat do you do next?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The runes on the ground pulse in rhythm with your heartbeat, and you sense a connection forming between you and the forest. The voice that had spoken earlier returns, but this time, the words are clearer, as if the magic has translated them for you.\n\n&quot;Seeker of secrets, you have awakened the ancient knowledge. To proceed, you must prove your worth. The path ahead is fraught with danger, but also with great reward. Are you prepared to face the trials of the Whispering Woods?&quot;\n\nYou nod, feeling a surge of determination. The book hovers closer to you, and the pages begin to glow, revealing a detailed map of the forest. Marked on the map are three locations: the Cave of Echoes, the Enchanted Grove, and the Tower of Shadows. Each location is said to hold a key that, when combined, will reveal the entrance to the hidden treasure.\n\nThe voice continues, &quot;Choose wisely, for each path holds its own perils and tests. The Cave of Echoes challenges the mind, the Enchanted Grove tests the heart, and the Tower of Shadows measures one&#x27;s courage. Where will you begin your quest?&quot;\n\nYou study the map, weighing your options. The Cave of Echoes, with its labyrinthine passages and deceptive sounds, seems a formidable challenge for your intellect.

The trees grow denser, their branches twisting like the arms of ancient guardians, and the air grows colder with each step. The sounds of the forest become muted, replaced by an eerie silence that seems to press in on you from all sides.\n\nAfter hours of navigating the dark forest, you finally catch sight of the Tower of Shadows. It looms in the distance, a tall, foreboding structure made of black stone, its surface shimmering with an unnatural sheen. The tower seems to absorb the light around it, casting long shadows that stretch out like grasping fingers.\n\nAs you approach the base of the tower, you notice a heavy wooden door, intricately carved with scenes of battles and mythical creatures. The air is thick with a sense of ancient power, and you can feel the weight of the tower&#x27;s history pressing down on you.\n\nYou reach out to push open the door, but it doesn&#x27;t budge. Instead, a voice emanates from the stone, deep and resonant, much like the one you heard in the clearing.\n\n&quot;Only the brave may enter,&quot; it intones. &quot;To prove your courage, you must face the guardian of the tower. Do you accept this challenge?&quot;\n\nYou nod, and as if in response, the ground beneath your feet begins to tremble. The earth splits open, and from the chasm emerges a massive figure clad in dark armor, wielding a gleaming sword. The guardian&#x27;s eyes burn with an otherworldly fire, and its presence exudes an aura of fear and intimidation.\n\nThe guardian steps forward, raising its sword high. &quot;Prove your bravery, seeker,&quot; it booms. &quot;Only those who can stand against their fears may enter the Tower of Shadows.&quot;\n\nYour heart races, but you steel yourself, drawing on every ounce of courage within you. The guardian swings its sword, and you deftly dodge, feeling the wind of the blade rush past your face.

For a moment, the forest is silent, and the air grows still, as if the very world is holding its breath.\n\n&quot;You speak with conviction,&quot; the guardian rumbles, its voice less menacing than before. &quot;Many have come before you with nothing but fear and aggression. Few have shown the wisdom to seek understanding over conflict.&quot;\n\nThe guardian sheathes its sword, the armor clinking softly. &quot;Very well, seeker. If you wish to befriend the tower and its guardian, I shall show you its secrets. But know this: the Tower of Shadows reveals not just the darkness within its walls, but also the shadows within your heart.

The interior of the tower is dimly lit by torches that cast flickering shadows on the walls, creating an atmosphere both eerie and enchanting.\n\nAs you step inside, the guardian follows, speaking in a softer tone. &quot;This tower was built long ago by those who understood that true strength comes not from the absence of fear, but from the ability to confront and overcome it. Each floor holds a challenge designed to test different aspects of your courage and character.&quot;\n\nThe first room you enter is a grand hall, its walls lined with tapestries depicting heroic deeds and legendary battles. At the center of the room stands a large mirror, its surface rippling like water. &quot;This is the Mirror of Truth,&quot; the guardian explains. &quot;It shows the deepest fears and desires of those who gaze into it. To proceed, you must look into the mirror and face what it reveals.&quot;\n\nTaking a deep breath, you step toward the mirror. As you gaze into its depths, the reflection shifts and changes. You see yourself standing in a dark, desolate landscape, surrounded by shadows. Figures from your past appear, their faces twisted with disappointment and anger. They accuse you of failure, of abandoning them, of not being strong enough.\n\nBut then, another image emerges. It is of you, standing tall and proud, having overcome your fears and doubts. You are surrounded by friends and allies, your heart filled with the light of confidence and courage.\n\nThe guardian watches silently as you confront the images in the mirror. &quot;Remember, seeker,&quot; it says softly, &quot;the shadows only have power if you let them. Embrace your strength, and you will find your way through the darkness.&quot;\n\nYou nod, feeling a newfound sense of determination. The images in the mirror fade, and the way forward becomes clear. You turn to the guardian, ready to continue your journey through the Tower of Shadows.\n\nWhat do you do next?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The flickering torchlight casts dancing shadows on its armor, making it seem almost alive. Finally, it speaks, its voice resonating with wisdom and experience.\n\n&quot;The darkness within each heart is a part of us, but it does not define us,&quot; the guardian begins. &quot;It is a reflection of our fears, doubts, and pain\u2014those aspects of our being that we often try to hide or deny. But just as there is darkness, there is also light within each of us. Courage, hope, love, and strength are as much a part of you as the shadows you fear.&quot;\n\nIt steps closer to the mirror, and you see its reflection as well. The guardian\u2019s image is not just one of an imposing figure in armor but also of a being with its own shadows and light, struggles, and triumphs.\n\n&quot;You are both the darkness and the light, the observer and the participant,&quot; the guardian continues. &quot;To understand oneself is to accept all facets of your being. By acknowledging the darkness, you do not give it power, but rather, you integrate it, finding balance and strength in your complete self.&quot;\n\nThe reflection in the mirror shifts again, showing moments from your life where you faced challenges and emerged stronger, where you showed kindness and resilience. These images intermingle with the darker moments, creating a tapestry of your experiences, both good and bad.\n\n&quot;You are the sum of your experiences, the choices you make, and the way you choose to face the world,&quot; the guardian says softly. &quot;You have the power to shape your path, to embrace both your light and your darkness, and to find harmony within yourself.&quot;\n\nFeeling a profound sense of clarity, you take a step back from the mirror. The guardian\u2019s words resonate deeply within you, helping you understand that your journey through the Tower of Shadows is not just a physical one, but also a journey of self-discovery and acceptance.\n\n&quot;Thank you,&quot; you say to the guardian, your voice steady. &quot;I am ready to continue.&quot;\n\nThe guardian nods, a hint of approval in its eyes. &quot;Very well, seeker.

In the center of the hall stands a massive, ornately decorated table. Atop the table is a large, detailed map of the Whispering Woods, with markers indicating various locations of interest.\n\n&quot;This is the Hall of Memories,&quot; Seraphon explains. &quot;It contains the history of the Whispering Woods and the tales of those who have ventured into its depths.

There is indeed more to this tower than just the trials. The Tower of Shadows is vast and filled with wonders, hidden chambers, and forgotten secrets. While the trials are the path to lifting the curse, the journey itself offers much to discover.&quot;\n\nWith a gentle smile, Seraphon gestures down the corridor. &quot;We can explore more of the tower on our way to the first trial. There are rooms filled with ancient relics, libraries with knowledge from forgotten times, and even enchanted gardens that have thrived within these walls for centuries.&quot;\n\nYou walk alongside Seraphon as the guardian leads you through the labyrinthine corridors of the tower. Each turn reveals something new and fascinating. You pass by a grand library, its shelves stacked high with dusty tomes and scrolls. The air smells of aged parchment and ink, and you can almost feel the weight of the knowledge contained within.\n\n&quot;This library,&quot; Seraphon explains, &quot;holds the collective wisdom of the seekers who came before you. Their discoveries, their triumphs, and their failures are all recorded here. It is a place of reflection and learning, where one can seek guidance and insight.&quot;\n\nNext, Seraphon leads you to a gallery filled with statues and artifacts. The sculptures depict legendary heroes and mythical creatures, each one intricately crafted and exuding a sense of majesty. The artifacts range from ancient weapons to mystical talismans, each with its own story to tell.\n\n&quot;These relics,&quot; Seraphon says, &quot;are remnants of past adventures. Each one carries a piece of history and a lesson for those who take the time to study them. They remind us that we are part of a larger tapestry, woven from the deeds and dreams of those who came before us.&quot;\n\nContinuing your tour, you arrive at an enchanted garden. The garden is a lush oasis within the stone walls of the tower, filled with vibrant flowers, towering trees, and gently flowing streams. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flora, and the soft hum of magic can be felt in the atmosphere.\n\n&quot;This garden,&quot; Seraphon explains, &quot;is a place of respite and renewal. It is sustained by the tower&#x27;s magic, providing a sanctuary for those who need to gather their strength and find peace amidst their trials.&quot;\n\nAs you take in the beauty of the garden, you feel a sense of calm wash over you. The serenity of the place is a stark contrast to the challenges that lie ahead, reminding you of the importance of balance and harmony.\n\nWith a smile, you turn to Seraphon. &quot;Thank you for showing me these wonders. They remind me that even in the midst of darkness, there is beauty and hope.&quot;\n\nSeraphon nods, its eyes reflecting your determination. &quot;Indeed, Ali. Now, let us proceed to the first trial. The journey ahead will test you, but remember the lessons you have learned and the strength you carry within.&quot;\n\nWith renewed resolve, you follow Seraphon as the guardian leads you deeper into the tower, toward the Trial of Fear.

Suffering is a part of the human experience, a complex interplay of emotions, choices, and circumstances. Your will magic can influence these elements, but it cannot always control them entirely.

Remember, you are not alone in this journey.&quot;\n\nYou follow Seraphon deeper into the tower, feeling the weight of your resolve and the power of your will magic. As you approach the entrance to the Trial of Fear, the air grows colder, and an eerie silence envelops you. The door before you is made of dark, polished wood, etched with symbols of protection and warning.\n\nSeraphon turns to you, its voice steady. &quot;Beyond this door lies the Trial of Fear. You will be confronted with your deepest fears, those that lurk in the shadows of your mind. To pass this trial, you must face them head-on and find the strength to overcome them.&quot;\n\nWith a deep breath, you step forward and push open the door. The room beyond is shrouded in darkness, the air thick with an oppressive weight. You take a step inside, and the door closes behind you, leaving you alone with your thoughts and fears.\n\nSuddenly, the darkness around you begins to shift and take shape. You see visions of your past failures, moments of doubt and pain, and the faces of those you could not help. The fear grips your heart, threatening to overwhelm you.\n\nBut you remember Seraphon&#x27;s words and the strength within you. You focus on your will magic, drawing on your determination and belief. &quot;I am stronger than my fears,&quot; you whisper to yourself. &quot;I will not let them control me.&quot;\n\nThe visions intensify, but you stand your ground, facing each one with courage. You reach deep within yourself, finding the light that burns within your heart. The fears begin to fade, replaced by a sense of calm and clarity.\n\nAs the last vision disappears, the room is filled with a soft, warm light. You feel a sense of accomplishment and peace, knowing that you have faced your fears and emerged stronger.\n\nThe door behind you opens, and Seraphon steps inside, a proud smile on its face. &quot;Well done, Ali. You have passed the Trial of Fear. Your courage and strength have brought you this far, and they will continue to guide you on your journey.&quot;\n\nYou nod, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. &quot;Thank you, Seraphon.

These are the fears that shape your actions and decisions, the ones that linger even when you believe you have conquered them.&quot;\n\nThe shadows coalesce into familiar forms, people from your past, moments of intense emotion. You see the faces of those you love, twisted in pain and sorrow. They call out to you, their voices filled with accusation and despair.\n\n&quot;You failed us, Ali,&quot; they say, their voices echoing in the darkness. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t save us. You weren&#x27;t strong enough.&quot;\n\nYour heart aches with the weight of their words. These are the fears that have haunted you for so long, the ones that make you doubt your magic and your worth.

Even the strongest of us cannot save everyone. The true test is in how you deal with this reality.&quot;\n\nYou take a deep breath, focusing on the core of your will magic. &quot;I can&#x27;t change the past,&quot; you say, your voice trembling but resolute. &quot;But I can learn from it.

It often stems from a combination of fear, ambition, and a need for control. Let me share what I have learned over the centuries.&quot;\n\nThe guardian leads you to a quiet alcove within the tower, where a small, stone bench sits beneath a window that looks out over the Whispering Woods. The sunlight streams in, casting a warm, comforting glow on both of you.\n\n&quot;Many sorcerers start their journey with noble intentions,&quot; Seraphon begins. &quot;They seek knowledge and power to protect, to heal, or to create a better world. However, as they delve deeper into the mysteries of magic, they often encounter the darker aspects of their own nature and the world around them.&quot;\n\nThe guardian&#x27;s voice grows softer, more reflective. &quot;Fear plays a significant role. Fear of loss, fear of weakness, fear of the unknown. These fears can drive a sorcerer to seek more power, believing that with enough strength, they can conquer their fears and secure their place in the world. But power, especially magical power, is seductive. The more one gains, the more they fear losing it.&quot;\n\nSeraphon pauses, looking out the window at the forest below. &quot;Ambition is another factor. The desire to achieve greatness, to leave a mark on the world, can push a sorcerer to pursue ever greater power. While ambition itself is not inherently bad, it can lead to dangerous paths if it becomes unchecked by wisdom and compassion.&quot;\n\nTurning back to you, Seraphon continues, &quot;Control is perhaps the most insidious aspect. The more power a sorcerer amasses, the more they desire to control their surroundings, their fate, and even the people around them. This need for control can become an obsession, driving them to use their power in ways that are harmful and destructive.&quot;\n\nThe guardian&#x27;s eyes soften with a hint of sadness. &quot;The sorcerer who cursed this tower, like many before and after him, was consumed by these desires. He sought to dominate the magic within these walls, believing that it would make him invincible. In doing so, he lost sight of his original purpose and became a prisoner of his own ambitions and fears.&quot;\n\nSeraphon places a reassuring hand on your shoulder. &quot;Remember, Ali, true power lies not in the ability to control or dominate, but in the strength to understand, to empathize, and to make choices that benefit not just oneself but others as well. Your magic, rooted in your will and belief, has the potential to bring great good to the world, but it must always be guided by compassion and wisdom.&quot;\n\nYou nod, absorbing Seraphon&#x27;s words. &quot;Thank you, Seraphon. I will keep your advice close to my heart as I continue my journey.&quot;\n\nWith renewed determination, you rise from the bench. &quot;I&#x27;m ready to face the next trial. What lies ahead?&quot;\n\nSeraphon stands beside you, its presence a steadying force. &quot;The next trial is the Trial of Despair. It will test your resilience and your ability to find hope in the darkest of times. You will be confronted with overwhelming sorrow and hopelessness, but you must push through and bring light to the darkness.&quot;\n\nThe guardian leads you to another corridor, the air growing colder and heavier with each step. As you approach the entrance to the Trial of Despair, you feel a sense of foreboding but also a deep resolve. You have faced your fears; now, you must face despair and emerge stronger.\n\nTaking a deep breath, you step forward into the trial, ready to confront whatever challenges lie ahead.\n\nWhat do you do next?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It was a heavy burden, knowing that I would never again walk freely in the world outside, never again see the changing seasons or feel the sun&#x27;s warmth on my face.&quot;\n\nThe guardian&#x27;s voice carries a tone of deep reflection. &quot;But over time, I came to understand that my role here, though isolating, was vital.

They shape us, teach us, and ultimately make us stronger. It is how we respond to these emotions that defines us. Your journey through the trials of this tower is not just about overcoming external challenges, but also about understanding and embracing your own inner strength.&quot;\n\nWith a deep breath, you absorb Seraphon&#x27;s words, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. &quot;Thank you, Seraphon. Your wisdom gives me strength. I am ready to face the Trial of Despair.&quot;\n\nSeraphon nods, its eyes reflecting pride and trust in your resolve. &quot;Very well, Ali. Let us proceed.&quot;\n\nTogether, you continue down the corridor, the air growing heavier with each step. The entrance to the Trial of Despair looms ahead, a large iron door etched with symbols of sorrow and resilience. As you approach, the door swings open with a creak, revealing a dark, oppressive chamber beyond.\n\nYou step inside, and the door closes behind you with a resounding thud. The room is shrouded in darkness, the air thick with a palpable sense of hopelessness. You feel the weight of despair pressing down on you, threatening to overwhelm your spirit.\n\nIn the center of the room, a figure huddles on the ground, shrouded in shadow. It is the source of the despair you feel, a manifestation of sorrow and loss. The figure weeps softly, its cries echoing through the chamber.\n\nYou approach the figure cautiously, your heart aching with empathy. &quot;Who are you?&quot; you ask gently. &quot;Why are you so full of sorrow?&quot;\n\nThe figure looks up, its face a reflection of your own inner pain. &quot;I am Despair,&quot; it says in a voice filled with anguish. &quot;I am the embodiment of all your doubts, your fears, and your deepest sorrows. I am the darkness that resides within your heart.&quot;\n\nYou kneel beside Despair, feeling the weight of its sadness. &quot;I have felt your presence many times,&quot; you say softly. &quot;But I will not let you control me. I will find the light within this darkness.&quot;\n\nDespair&#x27;s eyes meet yours, filled with a glimmer of hope. &quot;How will you do that?&quot; it asks, its voice trembling.\n\nYou take a deep breath, focusing on the core of your will magic. &quot;By believing in myself and my purpose. By understanding that even in the darkest times, there is always a spark of light. I will face my sorrows and rise above them.&quot;\n\nAs you speak, a soft glow begins to emanate from within you, illuminating the chamber. The darkness around you starts to recede, replaced by a warm, comforting light. Despair&#x27;s figure begins to change, its form becoming more solid, more human.\n\n&quot;I see the light within you,&quot; Despair says, its voice stronger now. &quot;You have the strength to overcome any challenge, to face any sorrow. You have the power to bring hope to others.&quot;\n\nWith those words, Despair transforms into a figure of light, a reflection of your inner strength and resilience. The chamber is now filled with a brilliant, comforting glow, and you feel a profound sense of peace.\n\nThe iron door swings open, and Seraphon steps inside, a proud smile on its face. &quot;You have passed the Trial of Despair, Ali. Your compassion and resilience have brought light to the darkest of places.&quot;\n\nYou nod, feeling a renewed sense of purpose and strength. &quot;Thank you, Seraphon. I am ready for the next trial.&quot;\n\nWith Seraphon by your side, you leave the chamber and continue your journey through the Tower of Shadows, knowing that each step brings you closer to lifting the curse and discovering the true extent of your magic.\n\nWhat do you do next?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It was through these trials that I found my purpose here, as a guardian and guide.&quot;\n\nThe guardian&#x27;s eyes meet yours, filled with a mixture of nostalgia and gratitude. &quot;The trials are different for each seeker.

We can support each other and learn from the experience.&quot;\n\nSeraphon nods, its expression resolute. &quot;Very well, Ali. We shall face the trials together.

This time, the visions are more intense, combining both your fears and Seraphon&#x27;s. You see yourself facing moments of failure and doubt, but you also glimpse into Seraphon&#x27;s past, witnessing its isolation and the burden of its eternal duty.\n\nSeraphon places a reassuring hand on your shoulder. &quot;Remember, Ali, we are in this together.

Now, let us move on to the Trial of Despair.&quot;\n\nTogether, you leave the first trial room and make your way to the chamber of the Trial of Despair. The air grows heavier, and an oppressive sense of hopelessness fills the space. The iron door swings open, and you both step inside.\n\nThis time, the chamber&#x27;s darkness reveals visions of deep sorrow and loss, both yours and Seraphon&#x27;s. You see moments of despair from your past, intertwined with Seraphon&#x27;s long years of isolation and duty.\n\nSeraphon speaks softly, its voice filled with empathy. &quot;We must find hope within this despair, Ali.

The corridor opens into a large, sunlit chamber filled with lush greenery and vibrant flowers. The sound of gently flowing water fills the space, creating a serene atmosphere.\n\nIn the center of the chamber stands a large, ancient tree with branches that stretch towards the sky. Its leaves shimmer with a soft, golden light, and the air around it is filled with a sense of profound peace and healing.\n\nSeraphon turns to you, its eyes reflecting both strength and kindness. &quot;The Trial of Compassion is the final test, Ali.

Let&#x27;s face this trial together.&quot;\n\nAs you step closer to the ancient tree, you notice several figures standing in the shadows beneath its branches. These figures are spirits, souls trapped by the curse of the tower. Their expressions are a mix of sorrow and longing, their eyes pleading for help.\n\nOne spirit steps forward, a young woman with tear-streaked cheeks. &quot;We are the souls bound by the curse of this tower,&quot; she says softly. &quot;Our pain and suffering keep us trapped here, unable to find peace. Can you help us?&quot;\n\nYou feel a deep sense of empathy for the spirits and turn to Seraphon. &quot;We must help them find peace.

She tells you of a life filled with hardship and loss, of moments of joy and sorrow.

Their expressions shift from sorrow to peace, and you feel a sense of warmth and fulfillment as you help each one find the light within themselves.\n\nAs the last spirit finds peace, the ancient tree begins to shimmer with a brilliant light.

The chamber fills with a blinding light as you channel all your energy into breaking the curse.\n\nDespite the sorcerer&#x27;s formidable power, you feel the strength of your belief and determination growing.

The amulet was Elowen&#x27;s most treasured artifact, a symbol of her wisdom and power. It is said to enhance the magic of its bearer, amplifying their will and abilities.&quot;\n\nYou reach out and carefully take the amulet, feeling its magic resonate with your own. &quot;Why did Elowen create the tower and place the trials here?&quot;\n\nSeraphon\u2019s expression grows solemn. &quot;Elowen foresaw a time when great darkness would threaten the Whispering Woods. She created the tower as a sanctuary and a place of testing, ensuring that only those with true courage, compassion, and wisdom could access its secrets and protect the woods. The trials were designed to prepare seekers for the challenges they would face, both within the tower and in the world beyond.&quot;\n\nYou nod, understanding the weight of Elowen&#x27;s legacy. &quot;So the tower exists to protect the knowledge and magic of the woods, and to prepare those who seek to defend it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Precisely,&quot; Seraphon replies. &quot;And now, with the curse lifted and the amulet in your possession, you are a part of that legacy, Ali. You have proven yourself worthy and capable of carrying on Elowen&#x27;s mission.&quot;\n\nYou feel a sense of pride and responsibility. &quot;I will do my best to honor Elowen&#x27;s legacy and protect the Whispering Woods.&quot;\n\nSeraphon places a hand on your shoulder, its expression filled with trust. &quot;I have no doubt that you will, Ali. Your journey has just begun, and with the amulet&#x27;s power, you are more prepared than ever to face whatever challenges lie ahead.&quot;\n\nWith the mysteries of the tower uncovered and the curse lifted, you feel a profound sense of fulfillment. The Tower of Shadows stands as a beacon of hope and knowledge, ready to guide future seekers on their own journeys.\n\nWhat do you do next?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

I will guide you as far as I can, but remember, the path you walk now is yours alone. The tower has prepared you, and I believe in your ability to find and help your friend.&quot;\n\nWith a renewed sense of purpose, you follow Seraphon out of the tower and into the Whispering Woods. The forest is dense and filled with an aura of ancient magic. The trees whisper secrets in the wind, their branches swaying as if guiding you forward.\n\nYou recall the tales of the Sages, wise beings who possessed unparalleled knowledge and magic. They were said to dwell in the deepest parts of the woods, where the veil between worlds is thin and the very fabric of reality can be altered.\n\nAs you venture deeper into the forest, you use the amulet to guide your way. Its glow illuminates hidden paths and reveals symbols carved into the trees, marking the way to the Sages&#x27; domain. The woods are filled with strange and wondrous sights\u2014glowing fungi, shimmering streams, and creatures that seem to be woven from the very essence of magic.\n\nAfter hours of navigating the mystical forest, you arrive at a clearing bathed in soft, golden light. In the center stands a circle of ancient stones, each one etched with runes and symbols. This is the entrance to the Sages&#x27; sanctum.\n\nSeraphon steps forward, its presence a comforting anchor. &quot;This is where I must leave you, Ali.

The air hums with energy, and the world around you shifts, the trees and stones blurring as you are transported to a realm beyond the ordinary.\n\nYou find yourself in a serene garden, filled with vibrant flowers and tall, ancient trees. At the center of the garden stands a group of robed figures, their faces obscured by hoods. These are the Sages, guardians of the forest&#x27;s deepest knowledge.\n\nOne of the Sages steps forward, their voice gentle yet powerful. &quot;Welcome, seeker. We have been expecting you. What is it you seek?&quot;\n\nYou bow respectfully. &quot;I seek knowledge and guidance to help my friend, King Claudi. He has lost his will and is beset by madness. I need to find him and restore his spirit.&quot;\n\nThe Sage nods, their eyes reflecting understanding. &quot;The path of healing and restoration is a difficult one, but not impossible. To find your friend, you must first understand the nature of his despair and the source of his madness.&quot;\n\nAnother Sage steps forward, holding a shimmering, crystalline sphere. &quot;Look into the sphere and see the truth of your friend&#x27;s heart. Only then can you begin to heal him.&quot;\n\nYou take the sphere, its surface cool and smooth to the touch. As you gaze into its depths, images begin to form. You see King Claudi, wandering through the forest, his eyes filled with a deep, unending sorrow. You see flashes of his past, moments of joy and triumph overshadowed by the weight of responsibility and the loss of loved ones. You see the burden of the crown and the isolation it brings.\n\nA voice echoes in your mind, gentle yet firm. &quot;To heal Claudi, you must reach out to him with love and understanding. Remind him of who he is and the strength he possesses. The amulet you carry will help you connect with his spirit, but it is your heart that will guide him back to himself.&quot;\n\nThe images fade, and you lower the sphere, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. &quot;Thank you,&quot; you say to the Sages. &quot;I understand what I must do.&quot;\n\nThe lead Sage nods. &quot;Go, seeker. Find your friend and bring him back to the light. May your journey be guided by the wisdom of the forest and the strength of your heart.&quot;\n\nWith a deep breath, you leave the sanctum and venture back into the Whispering Woods.

The air around you shimmers with a radiant energy, and you feel yourself becoming enveloped in a warm, comforting light. The garden fades away, replaced by a series of vivid, moving images that unfold before your eyes.\n\n---\n\n### Your Backstory\n\nYou were born into a world recovering from a long and dark curse that had stifled magic for generations. As the first child to be born with the return of magic, your birth was seen as a beacon of hope. Your parents, loving and wise, nurtured your natural abilities, teaching you the principles of will magic. This rare form of magic, driven by your imagination and belief, allowed you to shape reality in extraordinary ways.\n\nGrowing up, you were both revered and isolated. The townspeople admired your power but were also wary of its potential. Your parents encouraged you to use your magic for good, instilling in you a sense of responsibility and compassion. Despite the admiration, you often felt the weight of expectations and the loneliness that came with your unique abilities.\n\n### Meeting King Claudi\n\nAs a young woman, you formed a close friendship with Claudi, a prince burdened by the responsibilities of his future kingdom. He was kind-hearted and intelligent, but also deeply conflicted by the pressures of his royal duties. You and Claudi shared many adventures, exploring the lands and discovering the remnants of ancient magic. Your bond grew strong, forged by shared experiences and mutual respect.\n\n### The Curse and Its Lifting\n\nWhen the curse was finally broken, it was both a time of celebration and confusion. Magic returned to the world, but it also brought with it old wounds and new challenges. Claudi ascended to the throne, becoming King Claudi, but the weight of his new role and the kingdom&#x27;s expectations began to take a toll on his spirit. He struggled to balance his duties with his desire for personal freedom and happiness.\n\n### Your Motivation\n\nYour primary motivation is to help those in need and to use your magic to bring about positive change. You seek to understand the deeper mysteries of your abilities and to find a sense of belonging and purpose in a world that often feels overwhelming. Your journey is driven by a desire to support your dearest friend, King Claudi, and to help him rediscover his strength and will.\n\n### King Claudi&#x27;s Motivation\n\nKing Claudi&#x27;s motivation is deeply rooted in his sense of duty and his desire to be a just and compassionate ruler. However, he is also driven by a profound sense of inner conflict. He yearns for personal fulfillment and the freedom to explore his true self, but feels trapped by the expectations of his role as king. His journey is one of self-discovery, finding a balance between his responsibilities and his own needs.\n\n---\n\nThe images fade, and you find yourself back in the garden, the Sages surrounding you with expressions of understanding and support. The lead Sage speaks again, their voice filled with warmth. &quot;Ali, you are a beacon of hope and strength in a world that is still healing. Your journey is one of compassion, courage, and self-discovery. King Claudi, your dearest friend, needs your support to navigate his own path. Together, you will find the answers you seek and bring light to the darkest corners of your world.&quot;\n\nYou feel a deep sense of clarity and purpose, your questions answered and your motivations illuminated. With renewed determination, you thank the Sages for their wisdom.\n\n---\n\n**Your Appearance:**\nYou are a 28-year-old cisgender woman with a curvaceous figure and brown skin. Your elfin eyes are framed by dark long locs, and you wear rounded Harry Potter glasses. Your lush mouth and rounded nose give you a distinct and striking appearance. Today, you wear a jaunty green outfit that reflects your adventurous spirit.\n\n**Your Magic:**\nYou possess will magic, a rare and powerful form of magic that is only limited by your imagination and belief. This magic was the first to return after the long curse, marking you as a beacon of hope.\n\n**Your Relationships:**\nKing Claudi is your dearest friend. Despite misunderstandings and conflicts, your bond is strong, forged by shared experiences and mutual respect.\n\n---\n\nWith this newfound understanding, you step out of the Sages&#x27; sanctum, ready to continue your journey.

I&#x27;ve missed you.&quot;\n\nTears well up in his eyes, and he shakes his head, as if trying to clear the fog of his mind. &quot;I... I don&#x27;t know what to do, Ali. I feel so lost.

Glowing fungi line the path, casting an ethereal light that illuminates your way. Small, magical creatures dart among the trees, their eyes gleaming with curiosity as they watch you pass.

He looks up as you approach, recognition and surprise flickering in his eyes.\n\n&quot;Ali?&quot; he whispers, his voice filled with both hope and disbelief.\n\nYou kneel beside him, taking his hands in yours. &quot;Claudi, it&#x27;s me. I&#x27;ve come to help you. You don&#x27;t have to face this alone.&quot;\n\nTears well up in Claudi&#x27;s eyes, and he grasps your hands tightly. &quot;I... I thought I was lost.&quot;\n\n&quot;You are not lost,&quot; you say firmly. &quot;We will face this together. You are stronger than you realize, and I believe in you.&quot;\n\nUsing your will magic, you channel the healing energy of the amulet into Claudi. The golden light surrounds you both, pushing back the darkness and filling his heart with warmth and hope. Slowly, the haunted look in his eyes begins to fade, replaced by a glimmer of determination.\n\n&quot;I remember now,&quot; Claudi says, his voice growing stronger. &quot;I remember who I am and what I must do.&quot;\n\nTogether, you rise, the bond between you stronger than ever. The Whispering Woods no longer feel foreboding, but rather, a place of new beginnings and endless possibilities.\n\nWith Claudi by your side, you are ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead, knowing that your friendship and your magic will guide you through.\n\nWhat do you do next?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The amulet pulses softly, leading you deeper into the forest.\n\nAs you walk, the forest comes alive with the sounds of nature. Birds chirp melodiously, and the rustling leaves whisper ancient secrets. The path is winding, but the amulet&#x27;s light ensures you stay on course. You recall the Sages&#x27; words, feeling their wisdom and support bolstering your resolve.\n\nAfter a while, you arrive at a serene glade where the air is thick with enchantment. The light here is soft and golden, filtering through the canopy above. In the center of the glade stands a familiar figure, his posture weary and his eyes distant. It is King Claudi.\n\nHe appears lost in thought, his once regal bearing now overshadowed by a palpable sense of despair. You approach him slowly, careful not to startle him. As you draw near, he turns and meets your gaze, his eyes filled with a mixture of recognition and sorrow.\n\n&quot;Ali,&quot; he says, his voice tinged with both relief and sadness. &quot;You found me.&quot;\n\nYou step closer, your heart aching at the sight of your dear friend in such a state. &quot;Claudi,&quot; you reply softly, &quot;I&#x27;ve been searching for you. I&#x27;m here to help you, to bring you back to yourself.&quot;\n\nHe looks away, the weight of his burdens evident in his expression. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I can be helped, Ali. The kingdom&#x27;s responsibilities, the expectations... it all became too much. I feel like I&#x27;m losing myself.&quot;\n\nYou reach out, gently placing a hand on his shoulder. &quot;You are not alone, Claudi. I am here with you. Together, we can face whatever darkness haunts you.&quot;\n\nHe turns back to you, a flicker of hope in his eyes. &quot;But how? How can we overcome this despair?&quot;\n\nDrawing on the strength of your will magic and the guidance of the Sages, you hold up the amulet. Its glow intensifies, casting a warm, comforting light around you both. &quot;This amulet, a gift from the Sages, can help us connect with your spirit. It will amplify my magic and your strength. We need to remember who you are, Claudi. The compassionate, brave ruler and the kind-hearted friend.&quot;\n\nClaudi takes a deep breath, allowing the light of the amulet to wash over him. &quot;I trust you, Ali. Tell me what to do.&quot;\n\n&quot;First,&quot; you say, &quot;let&#x27;s find a place to sit and talk. You need to unburden your heart and let me share your pain.&quot;\n\nYou guide him to a nearby tree, its ancient branches providing a sense of security and comfort. You both sit, and Claudi begins to speak, sharing his fears, his doubts, and the heavy weight of his responsibilities. As he talks, you listen with compassion, offering words of understanding and encouragement.\n\nThe amulet&#x27;s light grows brighter with each shared moment, its magic weaving a bond between you and Claudi. You feel the despair begin to lift, replaced by a renewed sense of hope and connection.\n\n&quot;Remember, Claudi,&quot; you say gently, &quot;you are not defined by your failures or the expectations of others. You are defined by your courage to face these challenges and your ability to care for your people. And you don&#x27;t have to do it alone.&quot;\n\nClaudi nods, his eyes clearing as the weight of his despair begins to lift. &quot;Thank you, Ali.

Together, we can overcome anything.&quot;\n\nWith renewed strength and a clear sense of purpose, you and Claudi begin your journey back to the kingdom, ready to face the future together.

Queen Elinoora was supposed to take control, but things didn&#x27;t go as planned. There were factions within the court that opposed her rule, questioning her legitimacy and authority.

The Queen has been holding the court together, but the situation has grown dire. There are those within the palace who seek to usurp her authority.&quot;\n\nClaudi grips Sir Gareth&#x27;s arm, his expression determined. &quot;We must see Elinoora immediately. We need to stand together and face this threat.&quot;\n\nSir Gareth nods and leads you through the palace halls, which buzz with tension and unease. As you enter the throne room, you see Queen Elinoora standing strong, her presence commanding yet weary. Her eyes widen with surprise and relief as she sees Claudi and you enter.\n\n&quot;Claudi, Ali,&quot; Elinoora says, her voice a mix of strength and vulnerability. &quot;Thank the heavens you are here.&quot;\n\nClaudi rushes to her side, taking her hand. &quot;Elinoora, I am sorry for leaving you to face this alone. We are here to support you and to reclaim our kingdom.&quot;\n\nElinoora&#x27;s eyes soften, and she squeezes his hand. &quot;We have much to discuss, Claudi.

This choice requires cunning and patience, but it might give you an edge.\n   \n3. **Diplomacy**: You can attempt to communicate with the dragon, finding out what it wants and whether there is a peaceful solution.

The fortress looms ahead, its dark towers piercing the sky, guarded by formidable sorcerers and enchanted defenses.\n\n### Sneaking In\n\nYou manage to slip past the outer guards, their watchful eyes missing your invisible form. Your heart pounds with anticipation and a hint of excitement. Inside, the fortress is a labyrinth of stone corridors and arcane traps. You carefully navigate your way, relying on your magic to keep you hidden.\n\nAs you approach the chamber where the Dragonheart Crystal is kept, you sense a powerful magical barrier. Drawing upon your will magic, you attempt to dissolve the barrier. The shimmering veil begins to fade, but then your magic falters unexpectedly. The invisibility cloak around you wavers and dissipates, leaving you exposed.\n\n### The Encounter\n\nThe sorcerers, alerted by the sudden disruption, turn their attention to you. Their leader, a tall figure with piercing eyes and a staff crackling with energy, steps forward.\n\n&quot;An intruder!&quot; he snarls, raising his staff. &quot;Who dares to trespass in our domain?&quot;\n\nThinking quickly, you stand tall, refusing to let fear control you. &quot;I am Ali, and I have come to retrieve the Dragonheart Crystal.

You have no idea of its power, or what we intend to do with it.&quot;\n\nYou sense the tension in the room, but you refuse to back down. &quot;Your actions endanger everyone, including yourselves. The dragon will not rest until the crystal is returned. Do you really want to face its wrath?&quot;\n\nThe sorcerer leader hesitates, uncertainty flickering in his eyes. Before he can respond, you feel a surge of will magic within you, stronger than before. It seems the momentary failure of your invisibility cloak has heightened your resolve and focus.\n\n### The Confrontation\n\nRealizing that negotiation might not suffice, you prepare to use your magic in a more direct manner.

The crystal begins to glow brighter, its light pulsating with increasing intensity. The sorcerers&#x27; leader steps back, a look of concern crossing his face.\n\n&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he demands, but it&#x27;s too late.\n\n### The Overload\n\nThe Dragonheart Crystal emits a blinding burst of energy, filling the chamber with a brilliant, otherworldly light. The force of the explosion knocks the sorcerers off their feet and shatters their magical defenses. You feel the powerful energy coursing through you, mingling with your own magic in unexpected ways.\n\n### Unexpected Side Effects\n\nAs the light fades, you notice the crystal has changed. Its once smooth surface now bears intricate patterns, glowing with an inner light that matches the aura of your will magic.

You&#x27;re unsure what the long-term effects of this fusion might be.\n\nLeaving the sorcerers&#x27; fortress, you make your way back through the Whispering Woods, the crystal&#x27;s glow guiding your path. The journey back to Drakona is swift, your resolve strengthened by the connection you now share with the artifact.\n\n### The Return\n\nYou arrive at Drakona&#x27;s lair, the dragon shifter waiting expectantly. As you step into the chamber, the crystal&#x27;s light illuminates the dark space, casting intricate patterns on the walls.\n\n&quot;Great Drakona,&quot; you say, holding out the transformed crystal. &quot;I have retrieved the Dragonheart Crystal, but it has been altered. My magic mingled with its energy during the retrieval.&quot;\n\nDrakona&#x27;s eyes widen with a mix of surprise and curiosity. &quot;Let me see,&quot; they say, stepping forward to examine the crystal.\n\n### The Revelation\n\nDrakona takes the crystal, their eyes glowing as they inspect the changes. &quot;This is... remarkable. The crystal has indeed absorbed your will magic. This fusion of energies is unprecedented. It could hold great potential, but also great risk.&quot;\n\nYou nod, feeling the weight of Drakona&#x27;s words. &quot;What should we do with it now?&quot;\n\nDrakona ponders for a moment before responding. &quot;The crystal&#x27;s power must be carefully monitored and harnessed. Its new form could either stabilize the region or cause further disruption if not handled properly. We must work together to understand its new properties and ensure it is used for the greater good.&quot;\n\n### A New Alliance\n\nDrakona looks at you with newfound respect. &quot;Ali, your courage and determination have brought us to this point. Will you join me in this endeavor? Together, we can explore the potential of the crystal and safeguard the balance of magic in this land.&quot;\n\nYou feel a surge of pride and purpose. &quot;Yes, Drakona. I will stand by your side and help protect this land.&quot;\n\nWith this new alliance, you and Drakona begin to study the transformed Dragonheart Crystal, seeking to understand its new properties and harness its power for the benefit of all.

Let\u2019s add more layers, conflict, and adventure to your story. Here&#x27;s how your journey with Drakona can become more complex and engaging:\n\n### The Crystal\u2019s Aftermath\n\nThe transformation of the Dragonheart Crystal has unforeseen consequences. The mingling of your will magic with the crystal&#x27;s energy has created a new, unpredictable power source. While studying its properties, strange and dangerous phenomena start to occur in the surrounding area, causing unrest among the villagers and attracting unwanted attention.\n\n### Drakona\u2019s Hidden Motives\n\nAs you work closely with Drakona, you begin to notice subtle hints that his motives might not be entirely altruistic. There are moments when he seems overly protective of the crystal and evasive about certain aspects of his past. Despite your growing attraction, a seed of doubt is planted in your mind about his true intentions.\n\n### The Sorcerers&#x27; Return\n\nThe sorcerers who stole the crystal in the first place are not defeated. They regroup and plot their revenge, determined to reclaim the powerful artifact. They infiltrate the Whispering Woods, using dark magic to corrupt the forest and draw you and Drakona into a trap.\n\n### Conflict Within\n\nOne night, while you and Drakona are studying the crystal, an argument erupts. You question his secrecy and his true intentions. Drakona\u2019s temper flares, revealing a more complex and darker side to his character.\n\n---\n\n**You confront Drakona in the dim light of the lair, your voice tinged with frustration.**\n\n&quot;Drakona, I need to know the truth. Why are you so secretive about your past and your connection to the crystal? What are you hiding?&quot;\n\nDrakona&#x27;s eyes flash with anger and hurt. &quot;You think you can understand everything so easily? There are things I\u2019ve done, choices I\u2019ve made, that I\u2019m not proud of. But I\u2019ve been protecting the balance of magic long before you came into the picture.&quot;\n\n&quot;You\u2019re not the only one with a past, Drakona. We need to trust each other if we&#x27;re going to handle the dangers ahead.&quot;\n\nDrakona steps closer, his expression conflicted. &quot;It&#x27;s not that simple. My connection to the crystal is deeper than you know. If it falls into the wrong hands again, the consequences will be catastrophic. But there are things I can&#x27;t\u2014won&#x27;t\u2014tell you. Not yet.&quot;\n\n---\n\n### The Sorcerers&#x27; Ambush\n\nYour argument is interrupted by the sound of chaos outside. The sorcerers have launched an attack on the lair, their dark magic corrupting the forest and summoning malevolent creatures to do their bidding. You and Drakona must put aside your differences to fight them off and protect the crystal.\n\n### Unlikely Alliances\n\nDuring the battle, you discover that not all the sorcerers are committed to evil. Some are reluctant participants, coerced by the leader&#x27;s power. One such sorcerer, Lyra, defects and offers to help you in exchange for protection. Her knowledge of dark magic and the sorcerers&#x27; plans is invaluable, but her true loyalty remains uncertain.\n\n### The Heart of the Forest\n\nWith Lyra&#x27;s guidance, you learn that the sorcerers plan to corrupt the Heart of the Forest, a powerful magical nexus that sustains the Whispering Woods. If they succeed, the entire region will be plunged into darkness. You, Drakona, and Lyra embark on a perilous journey to the Heart of the Forest to stop the sorcerers and restore balance.\n\n### The Final Confrontation\n\nAs you reach the Heart of the Forest, a dramatic confrontation unfolds. Drakona\u2019s hidden motives come to light\u2014he has a personal vendetta against the sorcerer leader, who betrayed him long ago. This revelation shakes your trust, but you must decide whether to stand by him or find another way to stop the sorcerers.\n\n---\n\n**In the heart of the forest, surrounded by ancient, glowing trees, the final battle begins. The air crackles with magical energy as you confront the sorcerer leader.**\n\nThe sorcerer leader sneers. &quot;Drakona, you&#x27;ve always been weak, hiding behind your guardian duties. Now, you and your little friend will fall.&quot;\n\nDrakona\u2019s eyes burn with fury. &quot;You betrayed our kind, twisted the magic for your own gain. This ends now.&quot;\n\nYou step forward, feeling the weight of the crystal\u2019s power and your will magic coursing through you. &quot;We fight for the balance of magic, for the future of this land. Together, we will stop you.&quot;\n\n---\n\n### The Climax\n\nIn the heat of battle, Lyra\u2019s true loyalty is tested. She must choose between aiding you and Drakona or succumbing to the dark influence of her former master. Her decision could tip the scales of the conflict.\n\n### Aftermath and New Beginnings\n\nAfter a fierce and climactic battle, you manage to defeat the sorcerer leader and restore the Heart of the Forest. The balance of magic is preserved, but the experience leaves you changed. Drakona, having faced his past, becomes a more complex ally. Lyra, if she proves trustworthy, might become a valuable and nuanced addition to your group.\n\n---\n\n### What do you do next?\n\n1. **Solidify Your Alliance**: Work with Drakona and Lyra to strengthen your alliance, ensuring the safety of the Whispering Woods and preparing for any future threats.\n2. **Explore Further Mysteries**: Investigate other areas of the forest or the world beyond, seeking out new adventures and uncovering more magical secrets.\n3. **Reflect and Rebuild**: Take time to reflect on the recent events, rebuild the damaged areas of the forest, and train in your magic to become even stronger.\n\nWhat is your next move?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The world beyond the Whispering Woods is vast and filled with unknown magic and ancient secrets waiting to be discovered.\n\n### The Call to Adventure\n\nYou gather your allies, Drakona and Lyra, and discuss your plans. The recent events have strengthened your bond, but you know there is still much to learn and many dangers to face.\n\n&quot;There&#x27;s so much more out there,&quot; you say, determination in your voice. &quot;We need to understand the full extent of the magic in this world and protect it from those who seek to misuse it.&quot;\n\nDrakona nods, his eyes filled with resolve. &quot;The sorcerers were just one threat. There are countless others who would seek to exploit the magical energies of this land. We must be vigilant.&quot;\n\nLyra, now fully committed to your cause, adds, &quot;I have heard of ancient ruins and forgotten places where powerful artifacts lie hidden. These places hold the keys to understanding the true nature of magic.&quot;\n\n### Setting Out\n\nThe three of you set out on your journey, venturing beyond the Whispering Woods. Your first destination is a distant land known for its mysterious ruins and legends of powerful artifacts. The path is treacherous, filled with unknown dangers, but your resolve is unshakable.\n\n### The Ancient Ruins\n\nAfter weeks of travel, you arrive at the ancient ruins of an old civilization, long abandoned and overgrown with vegetation. The air is thick with magic, and you can feel the presence of powerful artifacts hidden within.\n\nAs you explore the ruins, you come across ancient inscriptions and symbols that hint at the presence of a powerful artifact known as the &quot;Eye of Eternity.&quot; This artifact is said to grant its wielder the ability to see into the past and future, a power that could be both a great boon and a terrible burden.\n\n### The Guardians\n\nYour search is interrupted by the appearance of mystical guardians, ancient constructs designed to protect the ruins and its secrets. These guardians, made of stone and enchanted metal, spring to life as you approach the central chamber where the artifact is said to be hidden.\n\n1. **Combat the Guardians**: Use your magic and combat skills to fight off the guardians and reach the artifact.\n2. **Outsmart the Guardians**: Solve the ancient puzzles and traps to deactivate the guardians and gain access to the artifact.\n3. **Negotiate with the Guardians**: Attempt to communicate with the guardians, using your knowledge of ancient magic to gain their trust and passage.\n\n### The Choice\n\nYou decide to outsmart the guardians, knowing that brute force might not be the best approach against such ancient magic. Using your knowledge and Lyra&#x27;s expertise in dark and ancient magic, you begin to decipher the inscriptions and solve the puzzles that control the guardians.\n\nWith each puzzle you solve, the guardians become less aggressive, their movements slowing as if recognizing your intent. Drakona uses his strength and agility to assist in maneuvering through the traps, ensuring your path remains clear.\n\n### The Eye of Eternity\n\nFinally, you reach the central chamber. The Eye of Eternity rests on a pedestal, its surface glowing with an otherworldly light. As you approach, you feel a powerful surge of energy, a connection to the ancient magic of the ruins.\n\nYou reach out and take the artifact, its power resonating with your own. Images flash before your eyes, glimpses of the past and potential futures. You see moments of great triumph and terrible loss, understanding the weight of the knowledge you now possess.\n\n### Unexpected Challenges\n\nAs you hold the Eye of Eternity, a vision of impending danger fills your mind. A shadowy figure, cloaked in darkness, seeks the artifact for their own nefarious purposes. This figure is powerful and has been watching your every move, waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\nYou share this vision with Drakona and Lyra. &quot;We have to be prepared. Someone is coming for the Eye, and they will stop at nothing to get it.&quot;\n\nDrakona&#x27;s expression hardens. &quot;Then we must use this time to understand the artifact&#x27;s full potential and prepare for the battle ahead.&quot;\n\nLyra nods, her eyes determined. &quot;We&#x27;ll need to use everything we&#x27;ve learned and trust in each other. This enemy will be unlike any we&#x27;ve faced before.&quot;\n\n### The Path Ahead\n\nWith the Eye of Eternity in your possession, your journey takes on a new urgency. You must decipher its secrets and prepare for the confrontation with the shadowy figure who seeks its power. The path ahead is fraught with danger and uncertainty, but you are ready to face it with your allies by your side.\n\nWhat do you do next?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

GHiF has been a vehicle through which I&#x27;ve channeled these efforts, focusing on enhancing individual and community well-being and happiness globally. Our initiatives extend beyond mere financial contributions; they involve creating partnerships and programs that address fundamental human needs like healthcare, mental wellness, education, and the joy of travel, which broadens minds and fosters understanding.\n\nPhilanthropy, to me, is about making a lasting impact by actively engaging in the betterment of society. It&#x27;s about creating opportunities for individuals to achieve their potential and lead fulfilling lives. This approach is rooted in a belief that true wealth is found not in personal possessions but in the richness of our contributions to society.\n\nCan you find 1-2 scholarly sources to support or enhance ideas/concepts or assertions presented in the passage above and insert references to them within the passage? \n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8889252bae3fbad5-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "14537cd8-db76-44cc-a97e-bbc7392b1a8e", "children": ["90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424"]}, "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424": {"id": "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424", "message": {"id": "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716510294.63038, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "json", "response_format_name": null, "text": "{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;impact of leveraging resources for philanthropic efforts&quot;, &quot;human&quot;: true}"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2f9bd-a89e-4cbb-b03a-2a70a000bdba", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200007]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8889252bae3fbad5-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2f9bd-a89e-4cbb-b03a-2a70a000bdba", "children": ["4456c4d9-5c26-48ae-9b6e-1f2822a322df"]}, "4456c4d9-5c26-48ae-9b6e-1f2822a322df": {"id": "4456c4d9-5c26-48ae-9b6e-1f2822a322df", "message": {"id": "4456c4d9-5c26-48ae-9b6e-1f2822a322df", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716510294.631951, "update_time": 1716510294.608243, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"jit_plugin_data": {"from_server": {"type": "confirm_action", "body": {"domain": "chat.consensus.app", "is_consequential": false, "privacy_policy": "https://consensus.app/home/privacy-policy/", "method": "get", "path": "/quick_search", "operation": "search_papers", "params": {"query": "impact of leveraging resources for philanthropic efforts", "human": true}, "actions": [{"name": "allow", "type": "allow", "allow": {"target_message_id": "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424"}}, {"type": "always_allow", "always_allow": {"target_message_id": "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424", "operation_hash": "ef26f5766b50deb71a60a99083acf4c086e7a67f"}}, {"name": "decline", "type": "deny", "deny": {"target_message_id": "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424"}}]}}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424", "request_id": "8889252bae3fbad5-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "assistant", "channel": null}, "parent": "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424", "children": ["6cc0d99e-a435-48de-a8c3-02b5137277ac"]}, "6cc0d99e-a435-48de-a8c3-02b5137277ac": {"id": "6cc0d99e-a435-48de-a8c3-02b5137277ac", "message": {"id": "6cc0d99e-a435-48de-a8c3-02b5137277ac", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716510298.483225, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"jit_plugin_data": {"from_client": {"type": "allow", "target_message_id": "90fd54a0-55a8-433d-a772-708394312424"}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "request_id": "88892553efcbbad5-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4456c4d9-5c26-48ae-9b6e-1f2822a322df", "children": ["62c0107d-9a5c-4cc7-9679-fc45c84c7818"]}, "62c0107d-9a5c-4cc7-9679-fc45c84c7818": {"id": "62c0107d-9a5c-4cc7-9679-fc45c84c7818", "message": {"id": "62c0107d-9a5c-4cc7-9679-fc45c84c7818", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716510314.323652, "update_time": 1716510299.5381997, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{&quot;items&quot;:[{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Making the case: leveraging resources toward public health system improvement in Turning Point states.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Leveraging funds to sustain the efforts of a grant-funded initiative is often an explicit, or implicit, expectation in philanthropy. However, the magnitude of funds leveraged and the factors that facilitate success in leveraging are rarely researched. An example of one of these grant-funded initiatives is the National Turning Point Initiative. Twenty-one states received funding from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as part of this initiative to establish and implement strategic goals for achieving significant statewide public health system improvement through diverse, cross-sector partnerships. Leaders from 17 of these 21 states participated in a two-phased study regarding the leveraging of additional funds for their public health infrastructure improvement activities. This article reports on the second phase of the study. In this phase, key informant interviews were conducted to examine how leveraging of resources occurred as part of this large national initiative. Findings indicate that the combination of a comprehensive planning process and a broad-based partnership was crucial in securing resources to expand their efforts. The ability to strategically respond to unexpected events and opportunities also helped states use their plans and partnerships to \\&quot;make the case\\&quot; for additional resources to improve their public health infrastructure.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;B.

A Study of Long-term Effects of the \u201cLearning by Giving\u201d Approach&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Student philanthropy is a teaching strategy designed to engage students actively in the curriculum, increase awareness of social needs and nonprofit organizations, and teach grant-writing and grant-making skills. This is the first study to examine long-term effects of student philanthropy by surveying alumni years after their experience with this teaching strategy. A majority of respondents indicated that student philanthropy had a positive effect on their awareness, learning, beliefs, and intentions. Further, 86% of student philanthropy alumni had recently made charitable contributions, 71% reported volunteering, and 15% served on nonprofit boards \u2013 all of which are much higher than the national averages for these behaviors.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

The original problem underlying the study is the long-term decline in the percentage of total corporate contributions to health and human services. A questionnaire, mailed in May of 1993, was used to investigate the impact of strategic philanthropy on the relationship between corporations and health/human service organizations. Corporations strategically prioritizing their philanthropic support were expected to create new opportunities for partnerships between business and health/human service agencies. The survey resulted in a sample of 226 corporations. The results showed statistically significant support for the hypothesis that highly strategic philanthropy programs will be more likely to enter into a health/human service partnership than less strategic programs. The multiple regression analysis method was used to control for the effects of corporate size, industry type, the (corporate) contributions management organization, and United Way credibility. Based upon the results of the study, United Way is recommended to consider new roles for itself as a facilitator of partnerships between business and health/human service organizations.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Data came from 1,628 students participating in the Pay It Forward student philanthropy initiative. Multivariate regression analyses reveal that having direct contact with nonprofits, doing research into an issue area, assisting in writing grant proposals on behalf of organizations, serving as group leader or co-leader, and investing a large percentage of class time in the philanthropy project are activities that most strongly predict student confidence in philanthropic skills, abilities, and knowledge. We also find that a high level of engagement (i.e., making important decisions, developing ideas, having responsibilities) is more significant than any single course activity in predicting student confidence and shifting philanthropic, volunteer, and work plans. Finally, we find that student philanthropy course activities have less of an effect on students who have previously participated in philanthropic activities.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jodi Benenson&quot;,&quot;Erika Moldow&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2017,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Journal of Public Affairs Education&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/paying-forward-role-student-philanthropy-course-benenson/b884983a18625628b3e012d8532408f0/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1080/15236803.2017.12002294&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;23&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;885 - 902&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:5},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Corporate Sponsorships of Philanthropic Activities: When Do They Impact Perception of Sponsor Brand?&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;We examined the benefits to a corporate sponsor of two types of philanthropic activities \u2014 cause promotions and advocacy advertising. Results from 4 laboratory studies indicate that perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) are affected by consumers\u2019 elaboration levels. Consumer perceptions of CSR are more favorable for cause promotions, which do not receive much elaboration, than they are for advocacy advertising, which prompts more elaboration. In addition, perceived congruence between the sponsor and the social issue is shown to moderate these effects: Higher congruence between the sponsor and social issue increases favorable ratings of CSR for cause promotions but only if elaboration on the sponsorship activity is facilitated. On the other hand, lower congruence increases favorable ratings of CSR for advocacy advertising as long as elaboration on the sponsorship is not constrained. We also found that higher congruence enhances CSR ratings if participants are primed to focus their attention on the sponsor brand, whereas lower congruence enhances CSR if participants are primed to focus their attention on the social issue.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Satya Menon&quot;,&quot;B.

Using the Giving in The Netherlands Panel Study 2003, we find that people with more extended networks and higher education are more generous. However, these effects can be completely explained by financial resources, church attendance, requests for donations, and pro-social personality characteristics. People with more extended social networks are mainly more generous because they receive more solicitations for donations, and are more integrated in extended religious networks that promote charitable giving. The generosity of people with higher formal education can be explained by their larger financial resources, and stronger verbal abilities. Whereas the effect of education seems mainly causal, that of network extension appears largely spurious.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Pamala Wiepking&quot;,&quot;I.

However, philanthropy is often misunderstood in Australia and there is limited evidence of philanthropic support for SRH initiatives.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators to philanthropic funding of SRH initiatives in Australia. A qualitative approach was used and involved 13 in-depth interviews with professionals from the philanthropic sector, and from organisations and services involved in SRH.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nBarriers to organisations in seeking philanthropic funding for SRH activities included insufficient resources for writing grant applications and the small financial value of philanthropic grants. Facilitators to seeking philanthropic funding for SRH included a perception that government funding is shrinking and that philanthropic research grants are less competitive than government grants. Philanthropic participants identified that barriers to funding SRH include the sensitive nature of SRH and the perceived conservative nature of philanthropy. Facilitators identified by these participants in supporting SRH initiatives included networking and relationships between grant-makers and grant-seekers. All participants agreed that philanthropy does and could have a role in funding SRH in Australia.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe findings of this research suggest that barriers to philanthropic funding for SRH in Australia exist for organisations attempting to access philanthropic funding. Philanthropic organisations could provide more financial support to Australian SRH service providers, as happens in countries such as the United States and United Kingdom. Addressing these barriers and promoting the facilitators could lead to increased awareness of SRH by Australia&#x27;s philanthropic sector.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Liz Gill-Atkinson&quot;,&quot;C.

In other words, corporate philanthropy, either in an amount too small or too large beyond a threshold, will not improve employee performance. Furthermore, we also found that the S-shaped relationship was moderated by employee benevolent attribution.

The pedagogy is intended to teach students not only about philanthropy but also about how to evaluate philanthropic responses to social issues. In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how an experiential approach to the philanthropic process could result in a more philanthropically engaged and committed citizenry. This research has provided promising evidence of the efficacy of experiential philanthropy as a pedagogic strategy \u2013 particularly within higher education. Despite its effectiveness, research on experiential philanthropy has focused primarily on the US. As such, we have no knowledge of the effectiveness of this pedagogic strategy in other regions of the world \u2013 especially in emerging philanthropic regions such as China. Therefore, using three semesters of original pre- and post-course survey data (including quantitative and qualitative responses) obtained from students enrolled in an Introduction to Nonprofit Management course at a university in northeast China, this study addresses the following question: To what extent does experiential philanthropy enhance Chinese students\u2019 understanding of, and commitment to, philanthropy?&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Huafang Li&quot;,&quot;Lindsey M.

Two prominent findings in research on charitable giving reflect this idiosyncrasy: The (1) identified victim and (2) victim number effects. The first of these suggests that identifying victims increases donations and the second refers to the finding that people\u2019s willingness to donate often decreases as the number of victims increases. While these effects have been documented in the literature, their underlying psychological processes need further study. We propose a model in which identified victim and victim number effects operate through different cognitive and affective mechanisms. In two experiments we present empirical evidence for such a model and show that different affective motivations (donor-focused vs. victim-focused feelings) are related to the cognitive processes of impact judgments and mental imagery. Moreover, we argue that different mediation pathways exist for identifiability and victim number effects.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Stephan Dickert&quot;,&quot;Janet Kleber&quot;,&quot;D.

This qualitative study examines one such effort: the Massachusetts Catalogue for Philanthropy. The study focuses on understanding what key individuals associated with the Catalogue think about its purpose(s) as a means of beginning to answer the underlying questions: How are these new philanthropy promotion projects different from traditional fundraising and to what degree are they contributing to a new philanthropic paradigm? Results and data analysis indicate that participants have varying opinions about the purpose of the Catalogue that come from two perspectives.

This paper argues that the perceived psychological costs of giving should also be taken into consideration when seeking to understand donations to charitable organizations. It is already known that people differ in their attitudes towards money, and that money attitudes are mostly independent from income, but these findings have been largely overlooked in the study of philanthropy and altruism. This paper seeks to rectify that omission by investigating the relationship between charitable giving and money perceptions. The analyses show that, regardless of the actual financial resources held by a donor, the size of their donations is negatively affected by feelings of retention (a careful approach to money) and inadequacy (people who worry about their financial situation). We conclude that an understanding of money perceptions is an additional important factor in the understanding of charitable behaviour. Fundraising professionals should not only select potential donors based on their absolute financial capacities but also take the potential donor&#x27;s own financial perceptions into account when asking for donations.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Pamala Wiepking&quot;,&quot;B.

This article is an effort to understand the strategies and tactics employed by foundations currently engaged in K-12 education policy. In-depth interviews conducted with senior staff members of 20 foundations identified as substantially engaged in education policy and school reform were conducted to examine three fundamental strategic choices: the foundation&#x27;s decision to engage in education policy, including the specific policy domain within education; the foundation&#x27;s choice on where to intervene in the policy process and at what level of government; and the foundation&#x27;s tactics to leverage additional resources. Findings suggest that foundations consciously seek to engage in education policy as an integral ingredient of their philanthropic initiatives and are led by staff and board leadership in these decisions. Most foundation activities in this arena aim to create individual niches of activity within the school reform agenda based on the foundation&#x27;s informed theory of change. As a group, however, foundation engagement in education policy is collectively cautious and ultimately incremental as foundations attempt to make change at the state and district level primarily through demonstration projects and funding research and development activities.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Less is known about an organization&#x27;s corporate philanthropic disaster response (CPDR) directed towards their employees. We argue, based on conservation of resources (Hobfoll, 1989, Am. Psychol., 44, 513) and compassion organizing (Dutton et al., 2006, Admin. Sci. Quart., 51, 59) literatures, that employees perceive employers who provide aid to them following a natural disaster as supportive. This aid from CPDR provides support to employees and helps to restore the loss of valued resources. Accordingly, we predict that satisfaction with CPDR reduces employee psychological and physiological strain via its positive effects on perceived organizational support. We find support for our predictions using a sample of 695 Hurricane Katrina survivors. Finally, we discussed theoretical contributions and implications of this research. \\n \\nPractitioner points \\nOrganizations are encouraged to fulfil their social responsibilities. Our research shows that organizations should be socially responsible not only to the general public, but also to their own employees. Responding compassionately by providing aid to an organization&#x27;s own employees is an important element in carrying out their social responsibilities. In the aftermath of a severe natural disaster, employees may need to rely on their organizations to provide timely assistance. Such assistance could help them mitigate their strain, both psychologically and physiologically, aroused from the disaster they experienced. \\nOrganizations&#x27; compassion organizing in the form of philanthropic disaster response to their employees may be beneficial to the organization. First, it shows the organization&#x27;s intention to fulfil their social responsibility and to be a good and ethical citizen. Second, by providing assistance to their employees to deal with the challenge of restoring normal lives, organizations can help employees to continue working in a productive and effective way.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

Specifically, we assessed how adopting this strategy impacted his followers\u2019 perceptions of, and level of fandom towards, his personal brand. Research Methods: We used a longitudinal research design including a pre-intervention survey, an intervention, and a post-intervention survey separated by a six-month interval. We analysed free-thought brand associations, perceptions of athlete philanthropy, and levels of fandom reported by an athlete&#x27;s Instagram followers from two independent samples (N T1\u2009=\u2009165; N T2\u2009=\u2009172) and a longitudinal sample (N\u2009=\u200932). Results and Findings: Results indicated that the athlete&#x27;s promotion of his philanthropic activities positively impacted his brand image. This change was characterized by a shift from the prominence of sport-specific brand attributes to perceptions of overall character. In addition, followers reported increased perceptions of the athlete&#x27;s engagement in philanthropy, and stronger levels of overall fandom towards the athlete. Research Implications: Findings demonstrated the promotion of philanthropic activities impacted the brand associations consumers linked to the athlete&#x27;s personal brand, and strengthened the overall connection between the athlete and his followers. Findings extend athlete branding knowledge and provide practical implications to inform how athletes and agents may implement social media brand management.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Thilo Kunkel&quot;,&quot;J.

Several methods were used in a sector-wide evaluation, including documentary \\nanalysis, one-to-one in-depth interviews, a cross-sectional survey of grant-holders, and collaborative work with Northern \\nIreland. There was a relative lack of strategic focus on older people before the philanthropic work began; evidence for \\npolicy and planning was limited and advocacy was small-scale and largely uncoordinated. This may have been because \\nthe Republic of Ireland had the lowest proportion of people aged \u226565 in the EU. The findings show that philanthropy has \\nplayed a pivotal role in enhancing capacity, infrastructure and expertise through large-scale investment in research and \\ntraining, strengthening older people\u2019s organisations and developing centres of excellence. Important initiatives include a \\nnational longitudinal ageing study, a commitment to develop a positive ageing strategy and roll-out of the Age Friendly \\nCounties programme. The sustainability of these notable achievements relies on a sector-wide collaborative ethos, \\ntranslating evidence into practice, actively involving older people and securing support from the academic, health and \\ngovernment sectors. Overall, the philanthropic organisation has contributed significantly to Ireland\u2019s efforts to develop \\ninnovative, evidence-based ageing strategies and policies.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

At the same time, \\&quot;strategic philanthropy\\&quot; has become the state of the art in corporate contributions management. Strategic philanthropy is defined in this article as the process by which contributions are targeted to meet both business objectives and recipient needs. This concept represents the integration of philanthropy into the overall strategic planning of the corporation. This article describes a national survey of corporate philanthropy programs that examined the activities that characterize the strategic management of corporate philanthropy. Results suggest that corporations do not frequently evaluate their philanthropy programs. Social work professionals may use this information to increase their opportunities to provide evaluative input and to increase corporate funding of health and human services.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

An Examination of the Impact of Success on Former Student-Athlete Philanthropic Giving&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Intercollegiate athletic departments (ICAs) rely on philanthropic giving to remain relevant in the \u201carms race\u201d that is college athletics. Donations provide the necessary resources (scholarships, upgraded facilities, etc.) to compete with rival programs for prospective studentathletes and fans. Previous research in ICA philanthropy has found that team success is one of the key factors driving donations to athletic programs. However, much of the research in this field has centered on athletic giving on a macro-level, focusing on the overall alumni population of an institution. While this research is important for colleges and universities, it misses on measuring the impact that success has on a key alumni subset for ICAs, former student-athletes. To address the gap in the empirical literature, this cross-sectional study used data from the University of San Diego (USD) to quantitatively examine the athletic careers of all 295 former men\u2019s basketball student-athletes and the impact that team and personal athletic success has had on their giving patterns as alumni. Utilizing logistic and multiple regression analysis, this study looked at whether select success metrics, including team championships and individual achievements, as well as other, non-success related variables (such as wealth and years since graduation) are correlated with philanthropic giving. Study results revealed the significance of net worth in predicting whether an alum will donate (but not on the total amount of their giving) and that alumni who reside near campus after graduation donate more over their lifetime than their peers who do not. This study also showed that, for each additional year a student-athlete was a part of the program, their probability of donating increases by 6% 8% and that, when ICAs do not have access to wealth information on donors, individual success on the court does have an impact on one\u2019s likelihood to donate. Taken together, findings from this study can help ICAs better understand the determinants of philanthropic giving and provide an analytical methodology that can be applied to data from their own institution; in effect, allowing them to more efficiently segment prospective athletic donors, become better stewards of their resources, and increase alumni giving participation.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Z.

Drawing on theories on prosocial sensemaking and on social identity theory, I propose that involving employees in corporate philanthropy encourages more benevolent attributions for philanthropy, thereby promoting higher attitudinal and behavioral commitment. In Study 1, a field study with employees and supervisors in a chemical-pharmaceutical firm, employee involvement in corporate philanthropy predicted higher attitudinal and behavioral commitment to the firm. In Study 2, a laboratory experiment, participants reported higher attitudinal and behavioral commitment to a company when it was described as involving employees in philanthropy. In both studies, benevolent attributions mediated the associations of employee involvement in philanthropy with both attitudinal and behavioral commitment. My research provides new insights for understanding the impact of corporate philanthropy on a particularly important group of stakeholders\u2014employees\u2014and shows how employee involvement may encourage insiders to act to improve the organization&#x27;s external image. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

As GHiF takes shape, it will strive to turn these principles into action, aiming to make a significant and positive difference in the world.\n\nCan you find 1-2 scholarly sources to support or enhance ideas/concepts or assertions presented in the passage above and insert references to them within the passage? \n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8889282adc99ba89-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8893995a-d1f8-417c-87a4-146b98a4277a", "children": ["17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f"]}, "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f": {"id": "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f", "message": {"id": "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716510416.02318, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "code", "language": "json", "response_format_name": null, "text": "{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;impact of non-monetary philanthropy on societal improvement&quot;, &quot;year_min&quot;: 2000}"}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200007]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2008a-55a5-4cfa-97cd-f5ac9aec023f", "request_id": "8889282adc99ba89-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2008a-55a5-4cfa-97cd-f5ac9aec023f", "children": ["f2265808-cd45-4d07-9a27-12865c7ec0e8"]}, "f2265808-cd45-4d07-9a27-12865c7ec0e8": {"id": "f2265808-cd45-4d07-9a27-12865c7ec0e8", "message": {"id": "f2265808-cd45-4d07-9a27-12865c7ec0e8", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716510416.024903, "update_time": 1716510415.9997745, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"jit_plugin_data": {"from_server": {"type": "confirm_action", "body": {"domain": "chat.consensus.app", "is_consequential": false, "privacy_policy": "https://consensus.app/home/privacy-policy/", "method": "get", "path": "/quick_search", "operation": "search_papers", "params": {"query": "impact of non-monetary philanthropy on societal improvement", "year_min": 2000}, "actions": [{"name": "allow", "type": "allow", "allow": {"target_message_id": "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f"}}, {"type": "always_allow", "always_allow": {"target_message_id": "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f", "operation_hash": "ef26f5766b50deb71a60a99083acf4c086e7a67f"}}, {"name": "decline", "type": "deny", "deny": {"target_message_id": "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f"}}]}}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f", "request_id": "8889282adc99ba89-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "assistant", "channel": null}, "parent": "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f", "children": ["c43c5fbb-8347-4890-ad7c-be969dcf9550"]}, "c43c5fbb-8347-4890-ad7c-be969dcf9550": {"id": "c43c5fbb-8347-4890-ad7c-be969dcf9550", "message": {"id": "c43c5fbb-8347-4890-ad7c-be969dcf9550", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716510419.394828, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"jit_plugin_data": {"from_client": {"type": "allow", "target_message_id": "17a858ee-a15d-4ea5-a2a3-35233d35ea0f"}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "request_id": "888928477c63ba89-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f2265808-cd45-4d07-9a27-12865c7ec0e8", "children": ["816eb7f1-49b0-4e3a-a517-424b348dd65a"]}, "816eb7f1-49b0-4e3a-a517-424b348dd65a": {"id": "816eb7f1-49b0-4e3a-a517-424b348dd65a", "message": {"id": "816eb7f1-49b0-4e3a-a517-424b348dd65a", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin.search_papers", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716510430.743547, "update_time": 1716510421.0862226, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{&quot;items&quot;:[{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Societal Marketing and Philanthropy in Dutch Companies&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;ABSTRACT In the concepts of societal marketing and social responsibility, it is assumed that profit companies should have an explicit policy to shape their societal involvement and their corporate philanthropy.

Corporate philanthropy is defined as a component of corporate social responsibility which opens new opportunities for business relationship with stakeholders and is contributing to promotion of corporate social involvement and to diffusion of the social responsibility principles implementation. With an emphasis on the positive impact of philanthropic activities on corporate economic performance, the benefits of corporate philanthropic activities to future revenue growth, characterized by improvement in corporate image, reputation development, business growth and customer loyalty are considered, as well as other economic benefits such as improved recruitment, the growth of innovation, value of share growth, sales growth, the increase in employee morale and productivity, the rise of customer curiosity to know companies which carry out philanthropic actions. This paper reviews the corporate philanthropic activities in Lithuania in recent years and focuses on the relationship between philanthropic activities of corporation \u201cTEO LT\u201d and its financial performance improvements. Having examined the issue of the impact of corporate philanthropic activities on its economic performance, the authors found that corporate philanthropic activities have a positive impact not only on corporate financial indicators related to future revenue growth, but also on other economic indicators, as well as on the relationship with all stakeholders.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;V.

It is predicted that the variables\u2019 company size, amount of philanthropic expenditure, region and industry influence the extent to which the various impact dimensions of philanthropy are measured. Though unexpected considering the lack of common practice in impact measurement, it is found that between 62 and 76% of the DJSI firms measure some sort of impact of their philanthropic activities, mostly impact on society and impact on reputation and stakeholder satisfaction. The number of firms that measure impact increases over the years and so does the number of firms that measure multiple dimensions of impact. Consist with our predictions, we find that larger firms and firms with relatively higher philanthropic expenditures are more likely to measure impact. Moreover, firms in the financial sector and firms from Europe and North America are also more likely to measure impact of their philanthropic activities.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;K.

We find that corporate donors positively influence NPO performance, specifically in the form of higher revenues per employee, program ratios, and fundraising returns. We find little evidence that large foundation or individual donors similarly enhance organizational performance. In additional analysis, we find that large corporate donations matter when the corporation is more likely to have influence over the recipient NPO. These findings suggest that corporate donors provide the monitoring and expertise needed to enhance organizational performance beyond simply providing funding to NPOs. Our results are robust to a two-stage model and propensity score matching to address endogeneity concerns. While prior research has examined the effect of corporate philanthropy on donor organization performance, we contribute to the literature by examining whether corporate philanthropy also improves recipient organization performance.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Andrew R.

A well-known phenomenon from history, philanthropy has made a come-back in recent years and is finding new form and meaning in an emerging \u2018civil society\u2019. But how do we define this new \u2018modern\u2019 philanthropy? Does it differ from concepts such as \u2018charity\u2019 and the \u2018third sector\u2019? Has it already earned a place at the table of EC policymakers? Is this \u2018old\u2019 but \u2018new\u2019 phenomenon awakening scholarly interest? These questions are discussed in this article. Philanthropy is defined by applying theoretical insights on the concept of philanthropy. Scholarly interest is measured by using the attention paid to philanthropy in leading English-language political science journals between 2000 and 2008 as a yardstick. The results show that though philanthropy is a distinct concept, it receives very little scholarly attention in these journals. The article concludes by arguing that the growth of philanthropy today offers a promising challenge for policymakers in welfare states provided that \u2018private actions for the public good\u2019 can be incorporated in the welfare-state paradigm. Points for practitioners Philanthropy is playing an increasingly stronger role in welfare states. However, governments and public administrators searching for new ways to fund welfare services have still to fully recognize the potential of philanthropy. In addition to commercialization and the market, a non-profit sector based more on philanthropic revenue could be an interesting option for delivering services. Public administrators will therefore have to rise to the challenging task of creating a legal, economic and cultural framework that will stimulate and enhance philanthropy.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;T.

Or perhaps employing their riches to endow art museums, libraries, museums and public art, enabling others to enjoy values otherwise undersupplied. These philanthropic examples are certainly appropriate, but by themselves they are misleading, for they suggest love of humanity \u2014 phil-anthropy \u2014 is the exclusive preserve of society\u2019s most fortunate. Humankind, upon which the philanthropists exercise their beneficence, constitutes a relatively passive and needy target of their Olympian good will. I want to offer a different analysis of philanthropy, one that by no means rejects the great merit of actions such as these, but pointing towards a larger, more liberal vision of philanthropy and its place in our world today. In the process I hope to demonstrate philanthropy\u2019s underappreciated potential in promoting liberty, equality, environmental sustainability, and even democracy. Consider this example, taken from a local newspaper: Oasis Health Center serves the health needs of the uninsured poor in and near Brunswick, Maine. While Maine provides health care for children and the very poor, childless adults and in some cases parents whose incomes are barely above the poverty line generally lack affordable medical care. Only when their incomes fall to the official poverty level of $185 a week, does MaineCare cover them. Oasis serves people who earn from that meager amount up to $275 a week. Staffed by volunteer doctors, nurses, physician\u2019s assistants, dentists, optometrists and chiropractors, the center provides urgent care as well as offering diabetes, depression, hypertension, and asthma clinics. Oasis also organizes outpatient support groups. Oasis accomplishes this ambitious program on a budget of under $70,000 annually. \u201cFor each dollar we spend\u201d says Dr. Peter McGuire, \u201cour clients receive about seven dollars in care.\u201d In her description of Oasis, Gina Hamilton explains \u201cThis is because so many things \u2014 time, pharmaceuticals, and space \u2014 are donated. The clinic employs only one full-time staffer, and six part-time managers.\u201d1 Their physical space is always donated, and two area hospitals cover lab work, x-rays, and other tests without charge to patients. A retired doctor visits physicians in the area, collecting sample medications they have been sent, but will not use. A nurse checks on patients to make sure they suffer no unexpected side effects, as well as serving other post visit needs. While people sending in monetary donations are clearly practicing philanthropy, so are the volunteers providing medical services, space, and other necessary services. Each of these nonmonetary donations could be replaced by a monetary one enabling the center to hire out these services. Limiting philanthropy to money gifts alone underreports its frequency and ignores millions who serve others. Philanthropy needs to be conceived as all actions dedicated to helping provide values to others within a community of relative strangers. The Oasis example offers us another insight. It is possible that MaineCare could be expanded to cover a wider range of people, incorporating those Oasis presently serves. If this happened, the result would be described as an expansion of public services. Those who created and sustain Oasis practice public policy by other means, outside the framework of government provision. They serve the public within the framework of civil society. Civil society is the larger institutional framework within which philanthropy works. But there is some uncertainty as to what should be included within the term. Libertarian and most classical liberal theorists argue examples like Oasis illustrate how markets can provide for needs we might think government is needed to serve. And yet, examined closely, Oasis is as subversive to the market liberal\u2019s dichotomy of government vs. the economy as it is to the common sequestering of public policy within the realm of government. I believe the socalled classical liberal framework is unable adequately to appreciate philanthropic action at a theoretical level.2&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

Design/Methodology/Approach: This study uses multiple regression analysis to study the relationship between corporate philanthropy and firm performance using 2012-2018 Hong Kong listed firm data. Empirical results show a positive association between the current and lagged corporate philanthropy and financial performance. Subgroup analysis shows that the relationship is contingent on the socio-political and government control factors. Our subgroup analysis reveals that Hong Kong firms benefit more from corporate philanthropy than Mainland China firms, and non-government control mainland private firms have a stronger positive relationship than the state-owned enterprises. Our results support social impact theory and political connection theory. Theoretical contribution/Originality: Our study bridges the gap of prior studies on the philanthropy-corporate finance relationship by isolating the separate effect of socio-political context impact and government ownership. We believe we are the first study in this respect. Our findings validate the results of prior studies in general and suggest the empirical results based on transitional economy data is, to some extent, generalisable. Practitioner/Policy implication: Contemporary data provides empirical evidences that corporate philanthropy could elicit positive responses from stakeholders to bolster corporate financial performance, except firms under government control. The positive impact of donation was immediate with a lasting effect as suggested in the literature and the result would be relevant for regulators in formulating policies regarding corporate social performance. Research limitation/Implication: Similar to previous studies, corporate philanthropy is proxy by the monetary amount of donation in this study. However, the context of corporate philanthropy very often goes beyond monetary donations and the findings may not apply to firms making substantial non-monetary donations.

Once regarded as the province of national governments, social policy is increasingly regarded as the legitimate enterprise of non-state philanthropic actors. We contend that global governance has created space for the emergence of philanthropic governors who make social policy through the accumulation and discretionary redistribution of wealth, thus depoliticizing discourse about global governance by reducing the visibility of the market and its negative impact on human well-being. First, we demonstrate how philanthropy and social policy are related as the politics of well-being. Second, we explore how philanthropic governing capacity as the redistribution of wealth becomes depoliticized and subsequently ends vital discourse about the relationship between the market and well-being.

As a result, the authors argue, companies often not only fail to achieve significant impact on society through their philanthropy but also miss opportunities to achieve strategic benefits for the organization.\\n\\nDrawing on research into a number of companies? experiences, the authors describe four types of corporate philanthropy. Some companies focus primarily on the needs of stakeholders, such as communities in or near where the firm operates; these companies conduct philanthropic initiatives that are often unrelated to their core business competencies. The authors call this peripheral philanthropy. Meanwhile, other companies focus more on using the corporation?s unique skills and competencies than on important stakeholder needs ? and as a result may end up with an internally focused approach that the authors dub constricted philanthropy. In some cases, often those involving corporate donations, corporate charitable activities are conducted without much overarching coordination at all, a method the authors call dispersed philanthropy. The authors maintain that the most effective approach to corporate philanthropy is one that incorporates both the needs of external stakeholders and the skills of the donor corporation. They call this strategic philanthropy and cite IBM?s Reinventing Education initiative as a good example of strategic philanthropy in action.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;H.

There has been concerns that humanistic values like an act of generosity within the society is dwindling due to this advancement. Philanthropic contribution is seen as a method to adverse the said impact. Still, this is dependent to the willingness of an individual to contribute as well as the knowledge of effective philanthropic mechanism. The practice of philanthropy is yet to become a nationally accepted culture as the number of the poor is increasing day by day. Besides, there has been a few cases of documented embezzlement of philanthropic funds that causes the public to be skeptical of the credibility of these philanthropic organizations; hence stopping them from contributing. Therefore, the aim of this study is to suggest a manual or guidelines to implement philanthropic practice nationwide. The data and information field regarding philanthropic practice amongst philanthropists are collected through semi-structured interviews from selective participants by purposive sampling method. Interview data is analyzed by using Atlas.ti and presented in the form of a final report. With this guidelines, any organization can adopt it for enculturing the philanthropic practices in their workplace and lives.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Mohd Farhan Ahmad&quot;,&quot;M.

In the past, most philanthropic gifts to colleges and universities were undertaken to benefit society. However, today this type of giving has evolved into funding organizations with political agendas which take advantage of harsh economic realities in order to drastically influence the changing landscape of our institutions of higher education. Specifically, several major topics were covered: (a) historical background, (b) philanthropy and business initiatives, (c) today&#x27;s venture philanthropy, (d) Massive Open Online Courses and (e) the impact of these factors on students in higher education. The paper concludes with a discussion of what happened at the University of Virginia last June and why it happened \u2013 when politics, power, and philanthropic givers combined in an attempted to remove Teresa Sullivan as the university&#x27;s president.

CSOs are popularly known as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Malaysia. Financial crisis has caused NGOs in many countries to receive less funding. This situation may threaten and discourage voluntary works. Undoubtedly, these beneficial contributions from the NGOs are needful services to the society. This paper examines the impact of financial crisis through the lens of NGOs and philanthropy activities in Malaysia. It utilises primary and secondary data, employs a mixed method approach, and uses quantitative and qualitative data. While there are many influencing factors in this development, this paper presents several significant aspects in the Malaysian context, including the style and nature of giving, culture, religion, and political pressure. This study attempts to seek potential solutions, pathways and possible approaches beneficial to NGOs and philanthropy activities for their sustainability in facing the financial crisis and its consequences. Experiences and lessons learnt in Malaysia may well be useful and applicable to some extent in other countries.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

However, as evidence so far has been mostly anecdotal, it is important to understand to what extent empirics support the actual practice as well as value of a strategic approach, which creates both business and social impacts through corporate philanthropic activities. Utilizing data from the years 2006 to 2009 for a sample of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI World), which monitors the world\u2019s most sustainable companies, the authors test a model of strategic philanthropy in which the dependent variable is evidence that a firm does or does not measure business and social impacts simultaneously. From the DJSI data, the authors find a proposed measure of overall corporate social performance (CSP) to be the most important explanatory factor for engagement in strategic philanthropy. Moreover, this measure of CSP has a mediating effect on the relations between certain independent variables and strategic philanthropy. Other important findings provide support for the influence of the institutional factors industry and region on the likelihood that companies are practicing strategic philanthropy, but little effect of the business characteristics company size and profitability on that likelihood.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;K.

Although the thought of philanthropy invokes feelings of altruism, there are many objectives for corporate giving beyond altruism. Meeting strategic corporate objectives can be an important if not primary goal of philanthropy. The purpose of this paper is to share insights from a strategic corporate philanthropic initiative aimed at increasing the pool of frontline customer contact employees who are performance-ready, while supporting curriculum development and infrastructure improvement for selected university business programs, creating a win-win situation for the company and the universities. This paper will address three objectives. First, we will examine the evolution of strategic philanthropy from the traditional view to its current position as a strategic option. Second, we will address the recruitment of front line talent needs (customer facing jobs in sales, customer service, and marketing) based on the profit maximization model of strategic philanthropy.

Some of those actions are social and show the social commitment of the company. Hence, philanthropic actions could be incorporated into the core business, through the implementation of a specific corporate philanthropy strategy. The company would then need to measure its financial and non-financial effects to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy. Philanthropic actions impact not only on the community but also on other stakeholders, for example employees, and it would be useful to identify and measure these effects. This paper describes an empirical study of 232 European companies. The findings show that a company\u2019s philanthropy strategies and the presence of women on the board impact on the attitude of its employees. Firms that have a corporate philanthropic strategy tend to have lower levels of labour controversies and incidents, with respect to those which apply discretional or sporadic philanthropic practices.

In response, many companies have sought to make their giving more strategic, but what passes for strategic philanthropy is almost never truly strategic, and often isn&#x27;t particularly effective as philanthropy. Increasingly, philanthropy is used as a form of public relations or advertising, promoting a company&#x27;s image through high-profile sponsorships. But there is a more truly strategic way to think about philanthropy. Corporations can use their charitable efforts to improve their competitive context--the quality of the business environment in the locations where they operate. Using philanthropy to enhance competitive context aligns social and economic goals and improves a company&#x27;s long-term business prospects. Addressing context enables a company to not only give money but also leverage its capabilities and relationships in support of charitable causes. The produces social benefits far exceeding those provided by individual donors, foundations, or even governments. Taking this new direction requires fundamental changes in the way companies approach their contribution programs. For example, philanthropic investments can improve education and local quality of life in ways that will benefit the company. Such investments can also improve the company&#x27;s competitiveness by contributing to expanding the local market and helping to reduce corruption in the local business environment. Adopting a context-focused approach goes against the grain of current philanthropic practice, and it requires a far more disciplined approach than is prevalent today. But it can make a company&#x27;s philanthropic activities far more effective.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M. Porter&quot;,&quot;M.

Given that the current market has become so competitive, various researchers now claim that the main objective of a firm must be to capture and retain consumers. To achieve this goal, companies must seek ways to retain their consumers over the long term (Boora &amp; Singh 2011). As such, many firms have begun to introduce corporate philanthropy, such as charitable donations, as a business strategy (Godfrey 2005). Specifically, the activity of corporate philanthropy introduces social concerns as an essential part of a firm&#x27;s strategic marketing. For example, the 2013 expenditure on charitable giving of just 261 companies, including major companies in the Fortune 500, reached over $25 billion, and the proportion of profits given to charitable donation has been significantly increasing over the last few years (Giving in Numbers: 2014 Edition CECP)Presently, corporate philanthropic activities are relatively easy to find. Firms fulfill their philanthropic responsibilities by contributing corporate resources such as financial donations, employee time, and facilities for humanitarian programs or causes. From a legal perspective, these activities are voluntary, not obligatory. However, society expects (or pressures) corporations to be involved in these altruistic activities as a means of \\&quot;giving back\\&quot; to the society. These societal pressures compel companies to implement appropriate philanthropic activities. Consequentially, corporations seek to establish a favorable corporate image and create a positive relationship with consumers that contribute to improving corporate value (Yoon, Gurhan-Canli &amp; Schwarz 2006), by responding to consumers&#x27; social concerns.With the rising adoption of corporate philanthropic activities by business practitioners, academics are paying increasing attention to corporate philanthropy (Brammer &amp; Millington 2005). However, over the past couple of decades, there has been some debate over the relationship between corporate philanthropic activities and corporate performance (Godfrey 2005). In particular, scholars have focused on the substantial or empirical effect of corporate philanthropic activities on corporate performance in terms of corporate reputation. For instance, Williams &amp; Barrett (2000), examining the influence of corporate philanthropic activities on corporate reputation, found that corporate philanthropy significantly enhanced corporate reputation. Brammer &amp; Millington (2005), analyzing the determinants of corporate reputation among large UK companies, concluded that philanthropic expenditures improved corporate reputation, although the level of reputation enhancement varied from industry to industry. Hsu (2012), studying the persuasive impact of advertisement by focusing on corporate social activities, found that a company&#x27;s advertisement of its social initiatives had positive effects on customer satisfaction, corporate reputation, and brand equity. This research verified the link between corporate philanthropic activities and corporate reputation.However, the underlying reasons as to why corporate philanthropic activities have positive impacts on corporate performance have not yet been determined, as far as the authors are aware. To understand the effect of corporate philanthropy on corporate performance, understanding the processes of how corporate philanthropy enhances corporate performance will offer more insight than simply investigating the direct link between corporate philanthropy and corporate performance.Therefore, this research addresses the key question of the mechanisms that make corporate philanthropic activities effective in enhancing consumer loyalty toward a firm. Although the ultimate goal of any firm is to maximize profit, consumer loyalty contributes to the attainment of this goal in the long run. The present study investigates the effect of corporate philanthropy on consumer loyalty, which in turn leads to corporate financial success. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Jongchul Park&quot;,&quot;Jieun Choi&quot;,&quot;Minsun Yeu&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2016,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Academy of Marketing Studies Journal&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/corporate-philanthropy-consumer-loyaltythe-mediating-park/15b3585b563d5b529eae9f73d768a3c5/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;20&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:19},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;The Limits of Nonprofit Impact: A Contingency Framework for Measuring Social Performance&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Leaders of organizations in the social sector are under growing pressure to demonstrate their impacts on pressing societal problems such as global poverty.

Then, describe how you will enact development plans that will positively contribute to your fundraising.\n\nWhile the terms&#x27; development&#x27; and &#x27;fundraising&#x27; are often used interchangeably, they have distinct roles within an organization. Fundraising primarily involves collecting monetary support, usually focusing on immediate financial targets and often driven by specific events or campaigns. On the other hand, development encompasses a broader scope. It includes fundraising but extends to nurturing long-term relationships with donors, strategic resource planning, and fostering a philanthropic culture within and around the organization (Frumpkin, 2005).\n\nThe strategic nature of development plans is a crucial element in enhancing fundraising efforts. These plans are not solely focused on acquiring funds but on retaining and engaging donors over the long term. They involve understanding donors&#x27; motivations, aligning these motivations with the organization&#x27;s goals, and creating meaningful engagement opportunities. This approach not only secures immediate financial support but also establishes a base of loyal supporters who are committed to the organization&#x27;s mission in the long run (Frumkin, 2005).\n\nAt the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation, I would implement these concepts in a variety of impactful ways. First, I would foster community engagement, ensuring that development activities deeply resonate with community needs and values. Second, I would prioritize transparency, providing clear information on how funds are used to strengthen trust and deepen donor relationships. Lastly, I would diversify funding sources by exploring revenue streams beyond traditional donations\u2014such as social enterprises or membership programs\u2014enhancing financial stability and ensuring alignment with the organization\u2019s mission. These strategies, when implemented collectively, would significantly boost fundraising efforts and align them with the broader goal of fostering a more equitable and joyful society.\n\n\n\n\nPart C: David Rubenstein discusses how anyone can be a philanthropist. He used his wealth to do \u201cpatriotic philanthropy\u201d to purchase rare documents for public consumption and fix historic buildings so Americans can learn more about their history. David reminds the listeners that although he has spent large sums of money on philanthropy, you don\u2019t need to spend money to be a great philanthropist. Describe how you have been or will be a great philanthropist.\n\nAs the conceptual founder of the Global Happiness Initiative Foundation (GHIF), I am deeply inspired by the idea that effective philanthropy does not require vast wealth. This is reflected in David Rubenstein&#x27;s (2015) notion of &quot;patriotic philanthropy,&quot; where he uses his resources to enhance public knowledge and national pride by preserving historical documents and monuments. Though GHiF is currently just a vision, it embodies my commitment to using available resources\u2014be it time, expertise, or networks\u2014to foster societal improvement. My vision for GHiF includes initiatives that go beyond financial aid, aiming to address essential human needs such as healthcare, mental wellness, education, and enriching travel experiences that broaden perspectives and promote understanding. Research indicates that corporate philanthropy can significantly impact societal causes even when it involves non-monetary contributions such as volunteer work and expertise (Van der Heyden &amp; Van der Rijt, 2004).\n\nFrom my perspective, philanthropy is about actively contributing to the betterment of society and creating opportunities that allow individuals to thrive. Studies have shown that corporate philanthropy can enhance both social and economic outcomes, benefiting communities and improving corporate reputation and performance (Navickas &amp; Kontautien\u0117, 2011).\u00a0 I believe that true philanthropic wealth is measured not by personal gain but by the impact we have on the lives of others. As GHIF takes shape, it will strive to turn these principles into action, aiming to make a significant and positive difference in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nDavid Rubenstein (Director).

free youtube transcript\n# You don&#x27;t need to be rich to be a philanthropist | Melissa Kwee | TEDxSingapore\n# https://www.youtube.com/watch/cJ0gl44Q358\n\n00:00:03.200 in 2009 Forbes magazine wrote an article\n00:00:08.029 that featured me in their heroes of\n00:00:12.750 philanthropy edition something is\n00:00:15.839 actually a little uncomfortable with but\n00:00:18.300 you couldn&#x27;t quite stop them I&#x27;d been\n00:00:20.939 working with my family&#x27;s business at the\n00:00:22.769 time and we were in the process of\n00:00:25.710 opening a hotel and at the same time I\n00:00:30.570 had also been involved with various\n00:00:32.159 nonprofits and it actually found out too\n00:00:36.989 that so many of the migrant workers the\n00:00:41.040 men and women who come to Singapore to\n00:00:42.570 clean to build to service Singapore\n00:00:47.190 we&#x27;re actually paying anywhere from six\n00:00:49.890 months even to two years of their\n00:00:52.590 salaries to labor agents that was not\n00:00:57.210 acceptable so my friend Peter and I\n00:01:00.949 thought about trying to create an\n00:01:04.170 alternative system a different way to\n00:01:07.830 recruit people and so we created a new\n00:01:12.540 process that would cap fees that would\n00:01:16.409 tell the people who are coming here\n00:01:18.150 exactly what they were getting for\n00:01:19.680 anything that they were paying and would\n00:01:21.900 actually help prepare them before they\n00:01:23.820 came to manage their expectations and\n00:01:25.799 actually welcome them once they had\n00:01:29.070 arrived it was important to me that we\n00:01:34.259 were able to help them feel at home so\n00:01:38.159 it was a little more effort than usual\n00:01:40.049 maybe but this was a business that I\n00:01:42.509 could influence in a small way for that\n00:01:45.689 for the better and I didn&#x27;t do it to be\n00:01:47.909 a philanthropist I did it because it was\n00:01:50.700 the right thing to do and maybe that&#x27;s\n00:01:53.640 what being a philanthropist is all about\n00:01:57.560 so what do you think of when you hear\n00:02:00.299 the word philanthropist who or what\n00:02:03.960 comes to mind\n00:02:05.600 tech giant wildly crazy entrepreneur\n00:02:12.390 super savvy investor I guess in many of\n00:02:17.680 our minds it&#x27;s sort of the rich and the\n00:02:19.060 powerful who give away millions if not\n00:02:21.310 billions to rid the world of of\n00:02:23.440 preventable diseases from which millions\n00:02:25.750 die every year or maybe rebuilding\n00:02:28.420 cities or maybe creating education and\n00:02:32.769 investing in disenfranchised populations\n00:02:37.500 but what&#x27;s the problem with this picture\n00:02:40.299 I think the biggest challenge is that\n00:02:43.209 philanthropy and the idea of being a\n00:02:45.549 philanthropist is such a far cry from\n00:02:47.680 everybody&#x27;s everyday life day jobs\n00:02:50.680 childcare managing homework but I&#x27;d like\n00:02:55.030 to challenge this idea about how\n00:02:56.859 philanthropy and the loving of humanity\n00:03:00.159 and the exercise of one values to\n00:03:03.400 benefit another is actually something\n00:03:05.560 that can happen every day by anyone\n00:03:08.140 anywhere in small simple personal and\n00:03:13.150 meaningful ways I&#x27;d like to challenge\n00:03:16.180 the idea that the person you&#x27;d least\n00:03:18.579 expect\n00:03:19.299 could be a philanthropist and that the\n00:03:21.940 sum of many small parts has an enormous\n00:03:24.940 impact and that everyone with some skill\n00:03:28.450 or talent can share and that together we\n00:03:33.849 can create a new culture based on these\n00:03:36.370 ideas so how many of you have raised\n00:03:41.410 funds or funded something on a\n00:03:44.319 crowdfunding site okay reasonable\n00:03:49.150 proportion of you there\n00:03:50.400 well a lot of us think of these sites is\n00:03:53.049 actually being very commercially\n00:03:54.400 oriented but did you know that in 2012\n00:03:58.260 the online site that site Kickstarter\n00:04:02.220 actually exceeded the National Endowment\n00:04:04.810 for the Arts in terms of funds\n00:04:06.910 distributed to arts groups in the United\n00:04:09.040 States and as of this year Kickstarter\n00:04:12.910 has raised one and a half billion\n00:04:15.040 dollars for over 80,000 art projects\n00:04:19.149 that gave aspiring artists theatre\n00:04:21.760 practitioners musicians filmmakers and\n00:04:24.370 the\n00:04:24.970 a chance to realize their dreams with an\n00:04:27.940 average contribution of $25 perhaps\n00:04:35.920 though less obvious are hidden heroes\n00:04:39.010 whose life choices can really inspire us\n00:04:41.610 a couple years ago I vetted I visited\n00:04:44.920 Myanmar and I met this woman Hana so she\n00:04:49.450 was living about an hour and a half\n00:04:50.710 outside of Yangon and she ran an\n00:04:52.600 orphanage with 19 children from the ages\n00:04:54.730 of like 3 months all the way up to 2 18\n00:04:58.270 years old the older kids helped the\n00:05:01.120 younger kids the place was completely\n00:05:02.710 spotless everybody&#x27;s toothbrush was\n00:05:05.080 really neatly lined up in the washing\n00:05:06.940 area and then when I asked her who\n00:05:09.340 supports you she told me a church in\n00:05:13.330 Singapore and my two sons and my first\n00:05:17.740 impression was of course that her two\n00:05:19.150 sons were like doctors lawyers or\n00:05:21.010 accountants or something you know maybe\n00:05:23.290 in Yangon or maybe even expats somewhere\n00:05:26.590 else but I asked her and they were\n00:05:29.620 actually expats but one was a security\n00:05:33.940 guard in a shopping mall and the other\n00:05:36.400 one was a construction worker and so\n00:05:40.090 later that week when I came home I\n00:05:42.090 glanced at that Burmese security guard\n00:05:46.150 and I saw him with new eyes could he\n00:05:49.960 have been the philanthropist that funded\n00:05:52.210 Hannah&#x27;s home I imagined them eating\n00:05:55.840 sparingly not spending very much on\n00:05:58.450 personal luxuries and probably saving\n00:06:00.970 50% of their salaries to remit back home\n00:06:04.510 and then I thought you know that&#x27;s\n00:06:08.020 pretty much what Bill Gates and Warren\n00:06:10.330 Buffett decided to do with the Giving\n00:06:12.100 Pledge back at home last year we\n00:06:15.790 actually also undertook this fascinating\n00:06:18.160 experiment we found two brothers Kauai\n00:06:21.430 and kaha aged 9 and 11 and these two\n00:06:25.630 brothers had posted or I guess their\n00:06:27.490 mother had posted on social media that\n00:06:29.080 they were giving away their own Bao\n00:06:31.240 money you know collected during Chinese\n00:06:33.940 Chinese New Year to the Singapore Cancer\n00:06:36.040 Society I guess they had\n00:06:37.550 family related resonance with that with\n00:06:41.480 the cause and these two brothers had\n00:06:44.870 just decided to do that and so we seize\n00:06:47.150 the day and we said hey let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s\n00:06:48.770 share this idea let&#x27;s tell other people\n00:06:51.170 that you know maybe they could do that\n00:06:52.550 too if even if it&#x27;s 1% 5% or 10% you\n00:06:56.630 know of whatever they could they could\n00:06:58.520 make a giveaway from from their own\n00:07:00.170 phone money to support a cause that just\n00:07:02.270 represented something that their family\n00:07:04.640 cared about and the results were\n00:07:07.520 astounding in the first 20 days of\n00:07:10.760 Chinese New Year donations through our\n00:07:13.040 online site were up 73 percent\n00:07:16.970 year-on-year it was a simple fun and\n00:07:20.330 meaningful idea that every everyone\n00:07:22.640 could participate in and it made all the\n00:07:24.650 difference to the nonprofit&#x27;s that they\n00:07:26.600 supported but giving is a lot more than\n00:07:32.030 just money\n00:07:33.020 it&#x27;s time it&#x27;s loving when you&#x27;re it&#x27;s\n00:07:36.650 loving your neighbor\n00:07:37.610 it&#x27;s person-to-person and it&#x27;s the\n00:07:41.030 offering of even if like our skills so a\n00:07:44.330 great a great Singaporean actually is a\n00:07:47.480 photographer Bob Lee some of you may\n00:07:50.120 have may have heard of him or seen him\n00:07:51.800 too and he was asked to teach\n00:07:54.440 photography to the blind he was called\n00:07:58.640 one day by a charity dialogue in the\n00:08:00.320 dark and and and given this intriguing\n00:08:04.040 offer sponsors had come in to help\n00:08:07.040 provide cameras printing services and\n00:08:09.230 space and everything and and Bob began\n00:08:12.830 to teach and one of his students was it\n00:08:17.390 was a gentleman called an elderly\n00:08:18.950 gentleman called uncle William and he\n00:08:20.780 produced his first photograph as you can\n00:08:22.970 see here kind of like cut off legs of\n00:08:26.000 someone and a dustbin and Bob asked him\n00:08:30.110 what&#x27;s what&#x27;s that about William we\n00:08:32.840 didn&#x27;t quite get the composition quite\n00:08:34.880 quite right but Uncle William told him\n00:08:38.390 well actually it&#x27;s about the dustbin and\n00:08:42.340 and Bob said okay well how does that\n00:08:44.870 actually work and he said well you know\n00:08:47.930 every day when I when I take this route\n00:08:50.090 he\n00:08:50.720 no to to go to work I look for that\n00:08:53.449 dustbin because when I hit it it tells\n00:08:55.160 me to turn so that I can cross but one\n00:08:59.509 day this cleaner actually moved the\n00:09:01.189 dustbin and I need him to put it back\n00:09:04.389 and Bob realized that sharing his skill\n00:09:11.439 gave him a view into a whole new world\n00:09:14.170 that he was seeing the world with fresh\n00:09:16.759 eyes and with deeper compassion as a\n00:09:19.370 result so maybe you can take photographs\n00:09:23.060 maybe you can cook maybe you can do\n00:09:26.509 accounts maybe you can write stories or\n00:09:29.180 maybe you&#x27;re just a really good\n00:09:30.410 listening ear how could you use your\n00:09:33.949 skill in service of someone else\n00:09:40.810 my friend Wally uses his company and his\n00:09:45.500 voice he&#x27;s a filmmaker and he raises\n00:09:48.649 awareness or he&#x27;s sought to raise\n00:09:50.209 awareness when he&#x27;s not like making\n00:09:53.120 videos of like wedding or weddings or\n00:09:55.040 doing beautiful food photography that he\n00:09:58.670 decided he was going to do something to\n00:10:00.170 combat this this haze which has kind of\n00:10:01.939 been enveloping you know our our whole\n00:10:04.250 our whole region recently and he decided\n00:10:06.740 that instead of just like moaning about\n00:10:08.959 it like most of us that he was actually\n00:10:11.629 going to crowdfund for masks and for air\n00:10:14.779 quality monitors and he was going to go\n00:10:17.930 with volunteers down to Kalimantan to\n00:10:21.259 distribute them and help educate the\n00:10:23.240 local the local people there and he did\n00:10:27.230 this at a time when of course most of us\n00:10:31.220 were just moaning about a 400 you know\n00:10:35.209 pia PM 2.5 and and he told me that when\n00:10:39.439 he went to Kalimantan the monitors\n00:10:41.959 actually didn&#x27;t work but the year but\n00:10:43.459 the app with the actual PM 2.5 levels\n00:10:46.370 there were actually in excess of 2\n00:10:48.050 million society is made better because\n00:10:51.319 of Wally&#x27;s who share their voice Bob&#x27;s\n00:10:54.259 who share their skill and families like\n00:10:57.350 kaho and kauai who teach the next\n00:11:00.529 generation the values of generosity and\n00:11:03.319 the love for human\n00:11:05.680 society is better because of the two\n00:11:07.880 nameless sons of Hana for practicing\n00:11:11.270 their radical love so my dream is to see\n00:11:15.170 all these parts and pieces connected in\n00:11:17.390 a big Network where skills voices funds\n00:11:22.040 ideas are all shared in one place in our\n00:11:24.890 city and what if we were able to\n00:11:28.370 actually create a marketplace where the\n00:11:30.770 whole city comes together and can we\n00:11:33.080 create for our common good\n00:11:35.680 what if neighbors knew what was needed\n00:11:38.180 and that those needs could be met in a\n00:11:41.330 timely in a timely way with available\n00:11:44.300 resources we all have some margin to\n00:11:48.560 spare and to share we all have influence\n00:11:52.040 and voice and we have friends and\n00:11:54.680 colleagues and family members to reach\n00:11:56.870 out to and I believe that we all have\n00:11:59.660 dreams of being lovers of humanity in a\n00:12:03.740 city of good my colleagues and I are now\n00:12:07.760 imagining and trying to build this\n00:12:09.320 giving platform so we can be Wally&#x27;s\n00:12:11.750 Bob&#x27;s or Hannah&#x27;s children or we can\n00:12:14.330 support them with our voice our skills\n00:12:17.390 or our funds as an expression of our\n00:12:19.460 love and we are well aware that\n00:12:22.130 technology is not the solution but\n00:12:24.980 purely an enabler for philanthropy and\n00:12:27.020 acts of love to be expressed so look\n00:12:31.520 around you I think you&#x27;ll see a\n00:12:34.340 philanthropist waiting to be discovered\n00:12:37.510 thank you\n00:12:46.310 you\n", "title": "tactiq-free-transcript-cJ0gl44Q358.txt", "tether_id":

Answers\n\nStanfordSOCIAL\nINNO VATIONReview\nInforming and inspiring leaders of social change\n\nPhilanthropy&amp; Funding\n\n12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and\nSome Answers\nCritics have argued that charitable giving isn&#x27;t focused enough on the poor, isn&#x27;t sufficient to make a difference,\nis undemocratic, and more, but research\u2014and history\u2014show otherwise.\n\nBy Karl Zinsmeister | May 17, 2016\n\nSince January, I&#x27;ve been traveling around the United States talking to audiences about my new book,\n\nThe  Almanac of American Philanthropy, and how private giving affects our nation. During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings. Consider the the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge,which raised money for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s\nDisease research.The initiative occasioned snickers and sniping from some professional\n\nphilanthropists, but donations it generated led to a major scientific breakthrough at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and pre-funding of clinical trials for new therapies.\n\nThere are many more examples. Crusades against autism by Bernie Marcus,against prostate cancer by\nMichael Milken, and against breast cancer by Nancy Brinker were all thought quixotic when they kicked\n\noff, yet each paid huge dividends. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute, and Markey fellowships would never have seen the light of day if many professionals\n\nhad had their way. And it was support from the Guggenheim family that allowed physicist Robert\nGoddard to overcome scorn from other scientists and ridicule by the New York Times to become the\n\ngenius of rocketry and father of America&#x27;s success in space.\n\nAmerica&#x27;s strong system of decentralized giving and homegrown problem-solving supports wide\n\nexperimentation and avoids putting all of our eggs in one national basket.\n\n5. Philanthropic aid lacks standardization! It&#x27;s a chaotic patchwork!\n\nThe lesson of the Internet is the accumulated power of millions of small actions. The story of today&#x27;s\n\nhacker culture is that one individual with a laptop can do astonishing things.Small-scale action that\nlacks uniformity should not be considered a failing.It&#x27;s not chaos,it&#x27;s crowdsourcing\u2014hordes of\neveryday people taking lots of small bites at a problem and eventually chewing through even very big\nissues.\n\nThere are rich examples of the power of dispersed decision-making throughout biology and across\nhuman history. Many of our most effective charities discovered the power of decentralization\ngenerations ago. Each of the I,4oo local chapters of Habitat for Humanity, for example,are independent\n\n3/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nentities with their own rules, practices, and funding. All of the 164 regional branches of Goodwill have\ntheir own boards of directors, and are autonomous in policy and funding; the central office is tiny\ncompared to working affiliates in cities like Milwaukee and Houston.And the Appalachian Mountain\nClub efficiently maintains thousands of miles of hiking trails through a network of local branches\n\nThis same principle of accomplishing important tasks through loosely coupled teams or networks of\nindependent actors is also a powerful trend in many of today&#x27;s most successful private businesses. Every\n\nUber city in America has different fares,different products, different practices. Philanthropy can be\nproud of having been a pioneer in solving problems via a flexible ecosystem of participants, rather than\n\nby following standardized formulas.\n\n6. Charity may work for individuals, but what we really need are solutions that benefit entire groups!\n\nAmbitious people may look at the \u201cone soul at a time&quot; model prevalent in philanthropy and conclude\nthat it&#x27;s just too slow. But that perspective misunderstands what social reclamation usually requires. For\n\ntough problems like addiction and recidivism, the most successful solutions rely heavily on one-to-one\nhuman accountability. They take advantage of the useful information available when we actually know\n\nsomeone, instead of dealing with a stranger. By creating personal instead of impersonal transactions, we\n\ncan wield the power of relationships to teach and change behavior.\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to romanticize the &quot;consistency&quot; of government programs, and contrast it favorably to the\ncrazy-quilt of individualized variations in charitable aid, but consistency is not really how humans work.\nIf you have one child who needs a very structured environment and another who blooms when left to\n\nnavigate on her own, you don&#x27;t want one-size-fits-all schools; you want individualized services that\nrecognize and work with intimate differences of personality. You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding that in\ngovernment-run programs, but it&#x27;s a hallmark of philanthropic efforts.\n\nBen Franklin was one of the first donors to argue that philanthropy shouldn&#x27;t just transfer funds in an\n\nattempt to relieve men in their misfortune. It should help build up individuals into a healthier state.\n\nThe goal of charitable aid in the United States has always been individual competence and\n\nindependence\u2014not just social quiet. And this often requires a personal touch, real mentoring, and one-\non-one aid of the sort many philanthropic efforts emphasize.\n\n7. Philanthropy is undemocratic!\n\n4/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nSome critics,especially from the left,complain that donors accumulate too much power and that their\nmoney lets them impose their point of view on society. But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year. Measured against the $36o billion of cash that\nAmericans donate annually, and nearly that much more in the value of volunteered time,Gates\nFoundation commands less than I percent of our annual philanthropy. That is not an unhealthy\n\nconcentration of power.\n\nAmerican philanthropy is also diverse and diffuse. Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing. Philanthropy is not\njust a sign of self-rule,but also a source  of it\u2014a kind of nursery for broader loyalties to one&#x27;s fellow\n\ncitizens. A healthy democracy should encourage,not discourage,people from acting on their own to\n\nimprove what they judge to be the common good.\n\n8 .  Only government can lead important social change in a fair way!\n\nHistory tells a different story. Private donors and volunteers created the first schools,missions, colleges,\n\nand apprenticeships for Indians and African Americans,often in the face of state resistance.At the\n\nsame time government was enforcing Jim Crow laws,philanthropist Julius Rosenwald erected 4,977\n\nrural schools across America&#x27;s black belt. At the time of his death, 27 percent of all African American\n\nchildren in the United States were educated in one of the schools he built\n\n5/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThose who view such examples as ancient history and believe that all necessary reforms now flow from\ngovernment are gravely mistaken. According to the UCLA Civil Rights Project, America&#x27;s most\n\nsegregated and often most inadequate government-run schools are all in northern cities with activist\n\ngovernments: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In fact,the country&#x27;s\n\nmost segregated schools are in New York state, thanks to New York City, where the proportion of\n\nschools in which at least go percent of the students are black or Hispanic rose sharply from 1989 to\n2OIO.\n\nIt is private philanthropy that is shaking up New York City&#x27;s complacent educational establishment\ntoday by launching charter schools. There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J. Paul Getty, Leland Stanford,\nRussell Sage, and John MacArthur were known to exhibit shabby behavior. (Stanford, for example,\n\nemployed stock watering, kickbacks,bribery, and collusion.) Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints. Adam Smith taught us that\nfreely conducted commerce can take normal human behaviors\u2014including ugly and mercenary on es -\nand turn them to broadly productive uses.The same is true in the world of philanthropy.Part of the\nmagic of America&#x27;s charitable structure is that it can convert common human impulses into truth,\nuplift, and beauty for all of society.\n\nIo . Philanthropy distracts people who ought to focus on business!\n\nThe right side of the political spectrum sometimes complains that philanthropy drags too many\nproductive business people into do-gooding,distracting them from creating the commercial bounty that\n\n6/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nsociety counts on. But there are reasons to think that philanthropy actually strengthens capitalism.\n\nEconomists Zoltan Acs and Ronnie Phillips have observed that the United States has a distinctive\n\nmeans of \u201creconstituting\u201d wealth via philanthropy.\u201cPhilanthropy is part of the implicit social contract\nthat continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity,&quot; they write. Researchers Tino and Nima\nSanandaji agree that the \u201clegitimacy of American capitalism has in part been upheld through voluntary\ndonations.&quot; They note that &quot;much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to society.\n\nThis has had several feedback effects on capitalism. For one, the practice has limited the rise of new\ndynasties. Another positive feedback mechanism is that the donations to research and higher education\nhave allowed new generations to become wealthy?\n\nII. Philanthropy encourages collective thinking, collective responsibility, and collective action\u2014\nultimately leading to more government!\n\nThis is another concern sometimes launched from the libertarian right, where observers argue that\n\nwhat American society really needs is more individual responsibility, not more giveaways. However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations. Philanthropy has thus been crucial in allowing America to grow up as an exceedingly rare\nsociety where average people can steer their own lives without the state lurking over their shoulder.\n\nI2. Donating money is sometimes too much about the giver&#x27;s needs!\n\nGiving is a two-way transaction,and the satisfactions of helping are just as real and just as good for\nhuman flourishing as the satisfactions of having someone come to your aid. That&#x27;s why even people\n\n7/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nwith little disposable income are eager to give,and feel good when they do.\n\nSocial science research supports th is.In  a 20o8 paper, three investigators gave study participants\nmoney, and then asked half of them to spend it on themselves, and the other half to give it to some\n\nperson or charity.

Porter and Mark R. Kramer\n\nFrom the Magazine (November-December 1999)\n\nDuring the past two decades,the number of charitable\nfoundations in the United States has doubled,while the value of\ntheir assets has increased more than 1,100%.Foundations now\nhold over $330 billion in assets and contribute over $20 billion\nannually to educational, humanitarian,and cultural\norganizations of all kinds. No other country in the world can\nclaim such substantial and widespread commitment to\nphilanthropy and volunteerism. But are we, as a society realizing\nthe full fruits of this commitment?\n\nGrant-giving foundations are intermediaries between the\nindividual donors who fund them and the various social\nenterprises that they, in turn, support. But if foundations serve\nonly as passive middlemen, as mere conduits for giving, then they\nfall far short of their potential and of society&#x27;s high expectations.\n\nFoundations can and should lead social progress. They have the\npotential to make more effective use of scarce resources than\neither individual donors or the government. Free from political\npressures,foundations can explore new solutions to social\nproblems with an independence tha t government can never have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations Create Value in  Four Ways\n\nOne grant\nX\n\nMultiple grants\n3X-5X\n\nEntire operating budget of one organization\n\n50X-100X\n\nEntire field\n\n&gt;1,000X\n\nmillionsDollar value of resources affected by foundation activity\n\nEach successive approach leverages a foundation&#x27;s\n\nspecial assets more than the preceding one as the pool\no f  \u22ef\n\nV\n\n1. Selecting the Best Grantees.\n\nThe process of value creation here is straightforward. Like\ninvestment advisers in the business world,foundations can use\ntheir expertise to channel resources to their most productive uses\nwithin the social sector by funding organizations that are the\nmost cost effective or that address urgent or overlooked problems.\nFor example,of the many organizations that seek funding for\nprograms aimed at reducing the high school dropout rate, a\nfoundation can select the most effective one.Thus its dollar will\n\nearn a higher social return than a dollar given less knowledgeably\nby an individual donor. In this way, choosing recipients and\nallocating funds is itself a source of value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpertise to benefit from the increased tourism. The Packard\nFoundation&#x27;s grant paid for marketing consultants who taught\nCEDO how to turn  tourists  into members, creating an ongoing\nrevenue stream for CEDO far greater than the Foundation&#x27;s\n$50,000 grant.\n\nThe Echoing Green Foundation, created by venture capitalist Ed\nCohen,gives $1.4 million a year to improve the performance of the\nnonprofit sector even more broadly. It invests in social\nentrepreneurs, individuals with the drive and vision to catalyze\nsocial change. It aims to build a community of public-service\nleaders who share their experience, knowledge, and energy with\none another. To date, Echoing Green has funded more than 300\nfellows who not only pursue their own projects but also visit with\none another to share best practices. The lessons learned are\nrecorded, distributed to all grantees,and made publicly available.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, for example, the Charles and Helen Schwab\nFamily Foundation in San Mateo, California, joined with the\nPeninsula Community Foundation and the Sobrato Foundation in\na $2 million,two-year initiative to address internal issues of\nmanagement and growth at 16 local family-service agencies.\nEvery eight weeks for the life of the project, foundation staff\nmembers meet with all 16 agency directors. Management experts\nare brought in to address relevant topics. As a result of the group\ndiscussions, three of the grantees have decided that they ca\n\nThe range of ways in which foundations can assist nonprofits goes\nwell beyond making management-development grants.\nFoundations can become fully engaged partners, providing\nadvice, management assistance,access to professional service\nfirms, clout, and a host of other non-cash resources. Improving\nthe  performance of grant recipients often requires foundations to\nwork closely with grantees. It also requires the willingness to\nengage for the long term. Foundations are capable of both.\n\nn\n\n\n\noperate more efficiently if they merge,and foundation staff has\nworked closely with them to accomplish the merger. Because\ntechnology management has surfaced as a major issue, the\nfoundations have researched and funded technology needs at\nseveral of the agencies.\n\n4 .  Advancing the State of Knowledge and Practice.\n\nFoundations can create the greatest value by funding research\nand a systematic progression of projects that produce more\neffective ways to address social problems.At its best, such work\nresults in a new framework that shapes subsequent work in the\nfield-making every dollar spent by philanthropists, government,\nand other organizations more productive.\n\nWithin six years,India doubled its rice production, and Mexico,\nonce an importer of wheat, became an exporter. Nigeria and\nColombia created  their  own research institutes  modeled  on  the\nfoundations&#x27; research.  The Rockefeller Foundation subsequently\ndisseminated its results to organizations from 28 developing\ncountries. Altogether, many millions of the world&#x27;s poorest people\nbenefited from the knowledge created by those two foundations\n\nFoundations are uniquely positioned to study a field in depth.\nThey can set a new agenda and change both public sentiment and\ngovernment policy. The green revolution, for example, had its\nroots in research sponsored jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller\nFoundations in the late 1950s and early 1960s.Concerned with\nworld hunger and population growth, the two foundations\ncreated research institutes that developed new strains of wheat\nand rice tha t doubled and tripled crop output per acre.\n\n.\n\nStudies by the Carnegie Foundation have had a similarly powerful\nimpact on education in the United States over the last 95 years. In\n1904,Carnegie funded research by Abraham Flexner on the state\nof medical education, which revealed a widespread lack of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the field of education, the Philanthropic Ventures Foundation\nin Oakland, California, for example, focuses on grassroots\nfunding. In 1995, PVF created the Teacher Resource Grants\nprogram. Working within the large field of education, PVF chose a\nspecialized positioning appropriate to its small size. PVF provides\ninexpensive but badly needed classroom materials to teachers in\nits region\u2014materials that are useless if they don&#x27;t arrive quickly,\nwhen the teacher needs them.\n\nPVF notified more than 6,000 teachers that grants of up to $1,500\nwould be available for classroom materials,field trip s, or teacher\ntraining courses.(After a year of experience, PVF lowered the\nceiling to $500 per grant.) Teachers refer to the program as the\n\u201cfax-grant program\u201d because the foundation takes requests by fax,\nand then sends an answer within one hour of receipt and a check\nwithin 24 hours.\n\nSince its positioning is to help under-resourced teachers and it\nmakes thousands of small grants, the Philanthropic Ventures\nFoundation developed a no-paperwork rule, freeing teachers from\ntime-consuming grant applications.PVF finds that an elaborate\nprocess around  the receipt, investigation, consideration, and\n\nfunding of grant requests is not necessary in its chosen area.\n\nPVF is a perfect example of a foundation that tailored its activities\nto create value. Only by doing things differently from others, in a\nway that is linked tightly to what the foundation seeks to\naccomplish, can it achieve greater impact with the same grant\ndollars or enable its grantees to be more successful. Tailoring\nactivities to strategy is the way a foundation institutionalizes and\nreinforces its distinctive strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\ntyranny of the grant cycle, with barely the time to write up\npending grant requests between board meetings.

Fewer than 9% of foundations\n\n\n\nmake 75% or more of their grants in a single field, and only 5%\nfocus more than  90% of their grants in one field. Such scattered\ngiving is inconsistent with a clear strategic positioning.\n\nNor do the data suggest that many foundations are taking\nadvantage of their unique ways to create value. Among the largest\nfoundations,with assets in excess of $1 billion,each professional\nemployee handles approximately seven grants per year (and up to\n100 times as many grant requests). There are, on average, just\nthree professional employees for every field in which the\nfoundation makes grants. Staff at the largest foundations may\nwell have sufficient time and expertise to evaluate grants,but it is\nhard to see how even the most dedicated staff could have much\ntime to assist grantees.  The smaller the foundation, the more\nstretched the staff. Among the hundreds of foundations with $50\nmillion to $250 million in assets, there are five times as many\ngrants per professional,and an average of two staff members\nhandle grants in 11 unrelated fields. The smallest foundations\noften rely on the volunteer efforts of trustees, making it almost\ncertain that many decisions are reached with little formal\nevaluation at all.\n\nThose broad metrics also suggest that foundations are not using\nthe more powerful forms of value creation beyond selection.\nFoundations rarely contribute resources other than financial\nsupport. Only 2.2% of foundation grants were designated to\nimprove the grantees&#x27; performance.Ninety-five percent of all\nfoundation grants are for one year.Although one-year grants are\nsometimes awarded for several years in a row, there is little\nevidence that foundations exploit the opportunity to work more\nclosely with grantees over extended periods of time to improve\ntheir performance. Foundations, which should be able to take the\nlong view tend to focus on grant making quarter-to-quarter.\n\n\n\nFinally, while foundations express a strong interest in innovation\nand advancing the state of knowledge about society&#x27;s problems,\nvery few fund studies that  explore the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent approaches to a given problem. Only 8.8% of foundation\ngrants went to research,and most of that was in basic medical and\nscientific areas. Funding studies or data collection is rare, and\nfoundations generally see them as less desirable than current\nsocial services.\n\nInstead of funding research, many foundations seek to promote\ninnovation through seed grants that are designed to establish and\nsupport specific new programs.There is little benefit, however, in\nstarting new initiatives if they do not survive and grow. Too often\nfoundations overlook projects aimed at fostering the growth and\nreplication of new initiatives, or they fail to support the grantee\nover an appropriately long time span. They rarely do the up-front\nresearch and the postevaluation needed to ascertain if their\nprograms have been successful and have continued to thrive after\nthe initial period of seed grant support.\n\nIn some ways, however, the overall failure to evaluate the results\nof foundation grants is the most telling danger sign of all.Almost\nno money is set aside for program evaluation.Many foundations\nare ambivalent about whether funds should be spent on\nevaluation and whether assessing the performance of past grants\ncan improve future grant making. This ambivalence about\nevaluation is reinforced by the performance criteria used to judge\nfoundation staff. These tend to emphasize the paper trail of\npregrant analysis and recommendations and give little credit for\nachieving the real-world results that motivated the grant in the\nfirst place.Program evaluation,therefore, has only a downside:\nfailure risks censure, but success adds no reward.\n\n\n\nThe evaluations that do take place are often problematic in three\nways. First, they are limited to reports as to whether the money\nwas spent as intended (output evaluation);they do not attempt to\nmeasure social impact (outcome evaluation). Second,many of the\nevaluations are done by the grant recipients themselves, who\ninvariably seek further support from the foundation.How\nobjective and reliable are these reports likely to be? Third,even in\nthe few cases where the social impact of a program is measured by\nan outside consultant, it is usually assessed at the single grantee\nlevel,in isolation from the foundation&#x27;s other grants.Therefore, it\ndoes not reflect the foundation&#x27;s success in reaching its overall\ngoals.\n\nCertainly, evaluation may at times be costly and complex.But\ngiven clear goals at the outset, it is always possible. The criteria to\nevaluate a job-training program will differ from those used to\nevaluate a funding program for young artists. But meaningful\ncriteria can be established for both.\n\nConsider the San Francisco-based Roberts Enterprise\nDevelopment Fund,which focuses on creating employment for\nthe homeless and indigent. Working closely with its grantee\nRubicon Programs, REDF developed 25 criteria that not only\nmeasure the success of job-training programs but also help\nRubicon to manage the programs more effectively. In addition to\nthe most obvious criteria\u2014changes in employment stability\nwages,and job skills\u2014REDF and Rubicon found that related\nfactors such as substance abuse and even qualitative factors such\nas the trainees&#x27; own assessments of their success in reaching\npersonal goals were all meaningful measures of outcomes the\nprogram was trying to achieve.\n\nWithout evaluation, a foundation will never know whether or not\nit has been successful. The most basic premise of strategy-\nstriving for superior performance\u2014is violated if performance is\n\n\n\nnot measured.\n\nAddressing the New Agenda\n\nHow can foundations begin down the path we have outlined? A\nnumber of foundations, including those operating under the new\nrubric of venture philanthropy, are already moving in the\ndirection outlined here. But none that we have encountered has\ngone all the way. Putting these elements together into a coherent\nwhole will require developing a strategy, aligning operations with\nthat strategy, and revising the foundation&#x27;s governance so that the\nstrategy can be monitored effectively. Responsibility for such\nchange lies ultimately with the trustees and directors, who are the\nfiduciaries accountable for the use of the foundation&#x27;s (and\nsociety&#x27;s) funds.\n\nTo develop a strategy  the place to start is positioning. This always\nrequires systematic thought and research into important social\nchallenges that are not being addressed well by others. The goal is\nnot necessarily to identify the most important problem,since\nmany are important.W hat matters is how effectively the\nfou nd at ion  can  co n trib u te  to  its  so lu tion .\n\nSecond, a foundation can learn from prior efforts within its\nchosen area of funding. Do current socioeconomic trends favor\none approach over another? What are other organizations doing\nin  th e  fie ld? Can the  work  of th is  foun da tion  re in fo rce  o r\n\ncomplement theirs? Can we uncover root causes of the problem?\n\nThird,what unique strengths will enable this foundation to create\nvalue most effectively in its field? Part of the answer to this\nquestion comes from examining objectively where the foundation\nhas made the greatest impact in the past. It also comes from a\nre alist ic  assessm e n t  o f w eakne sses.\n\n\n\nScale plays an important role in the choice of strategy. A\nfoundation  needs enough  resources to pursue its particular way of\n\ncreating value.Larger foundations may well have the scale to\nwork in more than one field. If they choose to do so, each area\nmust have its own strategy and tailored operations. All\nfoundations, however, can create more value by putting a greater\nproportion of their resources to work.  This means stepping up the\nrate of giving in their chosen fields and investing a portion of\ntheir  investm ent portfolios to support their  philanthropic work.\n\nOnce the foundation has chosen a strategy, it can begin to realign\nits operations.  A foundation, like any enterprise, is a collection of\nmany activities. Each activity-how  proposals are solicited, for\nexample, and how grantees are supported\u2014must be tailored to\nthe chosen strategy  A particularly important aspect of\noperational alignment is the development of measures to help the\nfoundation know whether or not it has been successful.\n\nOperating strategically will require most foundations to rethink\ntheir governance systems. Change will be difficult in an\nenvironment where the pressure of processing grants and getting\nthe money out the door extends beyond the  staff to the\nboardroom. Today boards of all bu t the very  largest foundations\ndiscuss and approve specific grant allocations at th eir meetings.\nWithout goals or strategy, they have no way to delegate the grant\nselection process to staff and no framework through which to\nevaluate their experience.The Chicago-based Crown Foundation,\nin an effort to break this cycle, considers grant requests at only\ntwo of its quarterly board meetings each year; the other two are\nreserved for discussing policy, reviewing performance, and\nstudying issues in more depth. Boards need to move away from\nthe operating function of approving grants to focus on setting\nstrategy and evaluating outcomes.\n\n\n\nWith goals, a strategy, and evaluation mechanisms in place,staff\ncould have greater independence to make grant decisions\nthemselves on a more timely and flexible basis. At the Colorado\nTrust,the board considers and approves multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar initiatives that have clearly defined goals and a clearly\narticulated strategy  Once the board sets the  framework, program\nstaff has the authority to make individual grants for the life of the\ninitiative. Staff members, then, have greater responsibility and\nmore freedom to make decisions on individual grants, and the\nboard  has the tim e to study  the field, set overall strategies, and\nassess staff performance.\n\nFor those who care deeply about social problems and work\ntirelessly to make a difference, current foundation practices not\nonly diminish effectiveness,they inevitably reduce the\nsatisfaction that donors, staff, and trustees derive from their\nwork. Scattered funding, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with\ngrantees, and a lack of awareness of outcomes necessarily create a\ndivide between the foundation and the ultimate results of its\nwork.Acting strategically is much more difficult. But for trustees\nand staff alike, it will be far more rewarding as well.\n\nImproving the performance of philanthropy would enable\nfoundations to have a much greater impact on society.\nFoundations could play a leading role in changing the culture of\nsocial sector management.They could spearhead the evolution of\nphilanthropy from private acts of conscience into a professional\nfield. Until foundations accept their accountability to society and\nmeet their obligation to create value, they exist in a world where\nthey cannot fail.Unfortunately, they also cannot truly succeed.\nA version of this article appeared in the November-December 1999 issue of\nHarvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nMichael E.

me tell you my briefly my\n00:00:13.759 story um I&#x27;m from Baltimore um my my\n00:00:17.119 last name is Rubenstein and you think if\n00:00:18.920 name like that you might be somebody who\n00:00:20.880 is from a wealthy family their father is\n00:00:22.519 a doctor lawyer but my father um dropped\n00:00:24.960 out of high school to go into World War\n00:00:26.439 II as part of the Marines came back he\n00:00:28.960 met my mother they got married uh\n00:00:30.840 neither graduated from high school my\n00:00:32.279 father worked in the post office his\n00:00:33.600 entire life made about $7,000 at the\n00:00:35.719 peak so I knew if I was going to get\n00:00:37.640 anywhere I probably had to do it on my\n00:00:39.120 own uh in the sixth grade I heard a\n00:00:41.520 speech that was given not far from here\n00:00:43.719 I watched it on television some of you\n00:00:45.160 may be old enough to remember this\n00:00:46.320 speech was given by John Kennedy and he\n00:00:48.559 said in his famous inaugural address\n00:00:50.039 which was only 14 minutes the greatest\n00:00:51.480 inaugural dress I think of the 20th\n00:00:53.000 century he ask not what your country can\n00:00:54.920 do for you but what you can do for your\n00:00:58.039 country and I that speech my teacher\n00:01:00.960 drilled it into our heads and I just\n00:01:02.239 said okay I want to do something for my\n00:01:03.920 country making money meant nothing to me\n00:01:05.720 my parents had no money I didn&#x27;t think\n00:01:07.240 about making money so I said I want to\n00:01:09.040 do something to help my country so\n00:01:10.720 ultimately I decided the way I could do\n00:01:12.080 it was to go to law school and\n00:01:13.840 ultimately work in government and do\n00:01:15.720 something that might help my country if\n00:01:17.759 I did a good job in government so I got\n00:01:19.640 a scholarship to Duke University I got a\n00:01:21.720 scholarship to univ Chicago law school\n00:01:23.600 and then I went to work in a law firm in\n00:01:25.040 New York that a partner at which was the\n00:01:27.600 man who wrote that speech for John\n00:01:29.119 Kennedy his name was Ted s the greatest\n00:01:30.720 presidential speech writer I think of\n00:01:32.079 all time and after a few years of\n00:01:34.240 working for him um he s of hinted maybe\n00:01:37.000 that I wasn&#x27;t such a great lawyer maybe\n00:01:38.479 I should do something different and I\n00:01:40.560 talked to my clients and I said well you\n00:01:42.200 know I might do something different what\n00:01:43.399 do you think they said now&#x27;s a good time\n00:01:44.680 to leave so I got the idea that I\n00:01:46.680 probably wasn&#x27;t a great lawyer and Ted\n00:01:48.640 saon got me an interview with a man he\n00:01:50.600 said we&#x27; be the next president United\n00:01:51.840 States I could work in the White House\n00:01:53.000 just as he had done for President\n00:01:54.079 Kennedy I got a job as the chief counsel\n00:01:56.200 for a man named burby who was running\n00:01:58.680 for president in 1976\n00:02:00.360 30 days after I joined his um Senate\n00:02:02.600 staff he dropped out of his presidential\n00:02:04.039 campaign so I said uhoh maybe this\n00:02:06.000 happened to some to you as well I wasn&#x27;t\n00:02:08.080 a good lawyer my clients didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:09.479 was good my colleagues didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:10.758 was good I went to join a campaign in\n00:02:13.520 effect it it ended after 30 days and\n00:02:15.560 then I got a call out of the blue some\n00:02:16.879 of you may have in your career as well\n00:02:18.560 it said uh would you like to work for\n00:02:20.519 another man running for president who is\n00:02:22.120 this Jimmy Carter and I said well he&#x27;s\n00:02:23.680 the peanut farmer from Georgia and they\n00:02:25.080 said yes he&#x27;s going to be the nominee\n00:02:26.120 for Democratic party in&#x27; 76 I got the\n00:02:28.000 interview I went down to Georgia Carter\n00:02:30.280 was 33 points ahead when I joined his\n00:02:32.000 campaign he won by one point so he he\n00:02:34.840 often said to me you know what did you\n00:02:36.200 really contribute but White House staffs\n00:02:37.680 are not filled on Merit they&#x27;re filled\n00:02:38.879 on who worked in the campaign so I\n00:02:40.519 became the deputy domestic policy\n00:02:42.040 adviser at the president United States\n00:02:43.280 at the age of 27 three years out of law\n00:02:45.200 school I wasn&#x27;t qualified for that job\n00:02:47.080 he wasn&#x27;t qualified for his job so I\n00:02:48.440 figured we fit in\n00:02:50.400 um I managed to get inflation to 19% in\n00:02:53.680 my job very difficult to get inflation\n00:02:55.560 19% nobody&#x27;s done it since um there was\n00:02:58.280 a rumor that I was going to be promoted\n00:02:59.680 in the second term to be the senior\n00:03:01.200 domestic adviser if Carter&#x27;s reelected\n00:03:03.040 and on the strength of that rumor\n00:03:04.080 President Carter thinks he lost the\n00:03:05.239 election so I had to go find a job I\n00:03:07.400 went back and practice law in Washington\n00:03:08.959 it took me many months to convince\n00:03:10.120 somebody I knew how to do something in\n00:03:11.560 practicing law after finding myself\n00:03:13.920 being humiliated because I was a White\n00:03:15.400 House Aid one day next day I couldn&#x27;t\n00:03:16.680 get a job at practicing law finally\n00:03:18.159 somebody felt sorry for me I practiced\n00:03:19.920 law but once again my client said to me\n00:03:21.959 you know this might not be for you and I\n00:03:24.080 said to my my partners what do you think\n00:03:25.920 about this should I stay and they said\n00:03:27.280 maybe not so I decided I would and I\n00:03:30.200 took a chance I read that on average an\n00:03:31.959 entrepreneur starts a company between\n00:03:33.400 the ages of 28 and 37 and I read that\n00:03:35.599 when I was 37 so I said okay I&#x27;m going\n00:03:38.120 to start a company so without knowing\n00:03:39.959 anything about Finance I decided to\n00:03:41.519 start something called the carw group\n00:03:43.640 and I started in Pennsylvania Avenue I\n00:03:45.280 recruited three people actually knew\n00:03:46.480 something about Finance I told them I\n00:03:48.159 had some money but I really was\n00:03:49.280 exaggerating I told him when they showed\n00:03:51.080 up I would get the money so ultimately\n00:03:53.400 uh we start a company with $5 million\n00:03:55.239 today we manage $200 billion and it&#x27;s\n00:03:57.519 turned out to be one of the largest\n00:03:58.480 private Equity firms in the world when I\n00:04:00.239 hit the age of 54 Forbes Magazine put a\n00:04:02.879 story out about my net worth and my\n00:04:04.599 partner&#x27;s net worth and it became\n00:04:05.920 obvious to me that I had made so much\n00:04:07.920 money that I couldn&#x27;t possibly spend it\n00:04:09.599 on on houses and planes and boats and so\n00:04:12.319 forth which I didn&#x27;t really care much\n00:04:13.720 about anyway so I decided what I would\n00:04:15.400 try to do is atone for my sins getting\n00:04:17.399 inflation to 19% and maybe give it back\n00:04:19.759 to the UN government give back to the US\n00:04:21.560 government give back to my country but I\n00:04:23.160 wasn&#x27;t sure how to do it and it came\n00:04:24.520 about in a kind of U unusual way one day\n00:04:27.600 I was invited to an uh an auction in in\n00:04:29.800 New York I was told I would be able to\n00:04:31.360 see the Magna Carta and I said how can\n00:04:33.440 you see the Magna Carta it&#x27;s in England\n00:04:34.720 it turned out there are 17 copies of the\n00:04:36.560 Magna Carta and I had a chance to to see\n00:04:38.960 one of them it was the only one in\n00:04:40.080 private hands I decided that I would try\n00:04:41.919 to buy that and make sure it stayed in\n00:04:43.360 the United States because it was\n00:04:44.280 probably going to be auctioned off I was\n00:04:45.440 told by the auctioneer and leave the\n00:04:47.000 country so I went back that next night I\n00:04:49.039 bought it and I now put it on display at\n00:04:50.880 the National Archives it&#x27;ll be there\n00:04:52.080 permanently and I said I&#x27;ll do this for\n00:04:53.759 the for the country is a way to kind of\n00:04:55.440 make sure this document which was the\n00:04:56.880 inspiration for the Declaration of\n00:04:58.080 Independence the Bill of Rights the\n00:04:59.680 Constitution stays here and then other\n00:05:01.479 documents came available the declaration\n00:05:03.199 independence the Emancipation\n00:05:04.360 Proclamation the 13th Amendment which\n00:05:05.800 Freeds slaves the Constitution the Bill\n00:05:07.720 of Rights and I bought rare copies of\n00:05:09.400 them and put them on display at the\n00:05:10.600 state department the national\n00:05:12.320 Constitution Center the Smithsonian the\n00:05:14.120 library Congress as a way of saying to\n00:05:16.240 Americans take a look at these and learn\n00:05:17.919 more about your history in a recent Pew\n00:05:19.800 survey it turned out that 35% of\n00:05:21.840 Americans when they asked what river did\n00:05:23.160 George washingon cross during the\n00:05:24.440 Revolutionary War said the Rin River not\n00:05:27.039 that&#x27;s not true 33% of Americans when\n00:05:29.479 they asked who was the first treasury\n00:05:30.720 secretary didn&#x27;t know it was Alexander\n00:05:32.479 hamilt and they said it was Larry\n00:05:33.479 Summers so my theory is Americans don&#x27;t\n00:05:35.600 know enough about their history and you\n00:05:36.759 can be a better uh citizen if you know\n00:05:38.759 more about your history so I&#x27;m trying to\n00:05:39.960 buy these historic documents and put\n00:05:41.720 them on display make sure people know\n00:05:43.520 more about history as a way of\n00:05:44.880 introducing them to our history another\n00:05:46.840 thing happened by S tippity as well one\n00:05:48.639 time I was at the keny center and the\n00:05:50.919 man on the board was the head of the\n00:05:52.160 Park Service he told me that Washington\n00:05:53.520 Monument had suffered earthquake damage\n00:05:55.199 I told him I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll put\n00:05:56.639 up the money just ignore the government\n00:05:58.280 and the usual constraints forget\n00:05:59.680 Congress tell me how much it cost I&#x27;ll\n00:06:01.199 put up the money to fix it so he did he\n00:06:02.800 later came back and said Congress wanted\n00:06:04.039 to share the credit because they weren&#x27;t\n00:06:05.560 getting a lot of good credit so they\n00:06:06.560 said can they put up half the money I\n00:06:07.840 said okay so I just put up the money to\n00:06:10.199 repair the Washington Monument some of\n00:06:11.599 you may have seen the scaffolding there\n00:06:12.960 from time to time and then I came up\n00:06:14.520 with the idea that well that was a good\n00:06:15.960 idea but why not fix other historic\n00:06:17.800 things so I decided to help fix up\n00:06:20.000 monachello Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s home mon\n00:06:22.000 peer James Madison&#x27;s home Mount Vernon\n00:06:24.039 George Washington&#x27;s home the custus Lee\n00:06:25.840 Mansion at the top of Arlington and some\n00:06:27.639 other things that I&#x27;ll announce uh down\n00:06:29.120 the road and so what I&#x27;ve decided to do\n00:06:30.680 is to fix these historic buildings in\n00:06:33.000 part because I want to remind Americans\n00:06:34.319 of their history and try to do what I&#x27;m\n00:06:35.960 now called patriotic philanthropy which\n00\nThe file is too long and its contents have been

Fewer than 9% of foundations\n\n\n\nmake 75% or more of their grants in a single field, and only 5%\nfocus more than  90% of their grants in one field. Such scattered\ngiving is inconsistent with a clear strategic positioning.\n\nNor do the data suggest that many foundations are taking\nadvantage of their unique ways to create value. Among the largest\nfoundations,with assets in excess of $1 billion,each professional\nemployee handles approximately seven grants per year (and up to\n100 times as many grant requests). There are, on average, just\nthree professional employees for every field in which the\nfoundation makes grants. Staff at the largest foundations may\nwell have sufficient time and expertise to evaluate grants,but it is\nhard to see how even the most dedicated staff could have much\ntime to assist grantees.  The smaller the foundation, the more\nstretched the staff. Among the hundreds of foundations with $50\nmillion to $250 million in assets, there are five times as many\ngrants per professional,and an average of two staff members\nhandle grants in 11 unrelated fields. The smallest foundations\noften rely on the volunteer efforts of trustees, making it almost\ncertain that many decisions are reached with little formal\nevaluation at all.\n\nThose broad metrics also suggest that foundations are not using\nthe more powerful forms of value creation beyond selection.\nFoundations rarely contribute resources other than financial\nsupport. Only 2.2% of foundation grants were designated to\nimprove the grantees&#x27; performance.Ninety-five percent of all\nfoundation grants are for one year.Although one-year grants are\nsometimes awarded for several years in a row, there is little\nevidence that foundations exploit the opportunity to work more\nclosely with grantees over extended periods of time to improve\ntheir performance. Foundations, which should be able to take the\nlong view tend to focus on grant making quarter-to-quarter.\n\n\n\nFinally, while foundations express a strong interest in innovation\nand advancing the state of knowledge about society&#x27;s problems,\nvery few fund studies that  explore the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent approaches to a given problem. Only 8.8% of foundation\ngrants went to research,and most of that was in basic medical and\nscientific areas. Funding studies or data collection is rare, and\nfoundations generally see them as less desirable than current\nsocial services.\n\nInstead of funding research, many foundations seek to promote\ninnovation through seed grants that are designed to establish and\nsupport specific new programs.There is little benefit, however, in\nstarting new initiatives if they do not survive and grow. Too often\nfoundations overlook projects aimed at fostering the growth and\nreplication of new initiatives, or they fail to support the grantee\nover an appropriately long time span. They rarely do the up-front\nresearch and the postevaluation needed to ascertain if their\nprograms have been successful and have continued to thrive after\nthe initial period of seed grant support.\n\nIn some ways, however, the overall failure to evaluate the results\nof foundation grants is the most telling danger sign of all.Almost\nno money is set aside for program evaluation.Many foundations\nare ambivalent about whether funds should be spent on\nevaluation and whether assessing the performance of past grants\ncan improve future grant making. This ambivalence about\nevaluation is reinforced by the performance criteria used to judge\nfoundation staff. These tend to emphasize the paper trail of\npregrant analysis and recommendations and give little credit for\nachieving the real-world results that motivated the grant in the\nfirst place.Program evaluation,therefore, has only a downside:\nfailure risks censure, but success adds no reward.\n\n\n\nThe evaluations that do take place are often problematic in three\nways. First, they are limited to reports as to whether the money\nwas spent as intended (output evaluation);they do not attempt to\nmeasure social impact (outcome evaluation). Second,many of the\nevaluations are done by the grant recipients themselves, who\ninvariably seek further support from the foundation.How\nobjective and reliable are these reports likely to be? Third,even in\nthe few cases where the social impact of a program is measured by\nan outside consultant, it is usually assessed at the single grantee\nlevel,in isolation from the foundation&#x27;s other grants.Therefore, it\ndoes not reflect the foundation&#x27;s success in reaching its overall\ngoals.\n\nCertainly, evaluation may at times be costly and complex.But\ngiven clear goals at the outset, it is always possible. The criteria to\nevaluate a job-training program will differ from those used to\nevaluate a funding program for young artists. But meaningful\ncriteria can be established for both.\n\nConsider the San Francisco-based Roberts Enterprise\nDevelopment Fund,which focuses on creating employment for\nthe homeless and indigent. Working closely with its grantee\nRubicon Programs, REDF developed 25 criteria that not only\nmeasure the success of job-training programs but also help\nRubicon to manage the programs more effectively. In addition to\nthe most obvious criteria\u2014changes in employment stability\nwages,and job skills\u2014REDF and Rubicon found that related\nfactors such as substance abuse and even qualitative factors such\nas the trainees&#x27; own assessments of their success in reaching\npersonal goals were all meaningful measures of outcomes the\nprogram was trying to achieve.\n\nWithout evaluation, a foundation will never know whether or not\nit has been successful. The most basic premise of strategy-\nstriving for superior performance\u2014is violated if performance is\n\n\n\nnot measured.\n\nAddressing the New Agenda\n\nHow can foundations begin down the path we have outlined? A\nnumber of foundations, including those operating under the new\nrubric of venture philanthropy, are already moving in the\ndirection outlined here. But none that we have encountered has\ngone all the way. Putting these elements together into a coherent\nwhole will require developing a strategy, aligning operations with\nthat strategy, and revising the foundation&#x27;s governance so that the\nstrategy can be monitored effectively. Responsibility for such\nchange lies ultimately with the trustees and directors, who are the\nfiduciaries accountable for the use of the foundation&#x27;s (and\nsociety&#x27;s) funds.\n\nTo develop a strategy  the place to start is positioning. This always\nrequires systematic thought and research into important social\nchallenges that are not being addressed well by others. The goal is\nnot necessarily to identify the most important problem,since\nmany are important.W hat matters is how effectively the\nfou nd at ion  can  co n trib u te  to  its  so lu tion .\n\nSecond, a foundation can learn from prior efforts within its\nchosen area of funding. Do current socioeconomic trends favor\none approach over another? What are other organizations doing\nin  th e  fie ld? Can the  work  of th is  foun da tion  re in fo rce  o r\n\ncomplement theirs? Can we uncover root causes of the problem?\n\nThird,what unique strengths will enable this foundation to create\nvalue most effectively in its field? Part of the answer to this\nquestion comes from examining objectively where the foundation\nhas made the greatest impact in the past. It also comes from a\nre alist ic  assessm e n t  o f w eakne sses.\n\n\n\nScale plays an important role in the choice of strategy. A\nfoundation  needs enough  resources to pursue its particular way of\n\ncreating value.Larger foundations may well have the scale to\nwork in more than one field. If they choose to do so, each area\nmust have its own strategy and tailored operations. All\nfoundations, however, can create more value by putting a greater\nproportion of their resources to work.  This means stepping up the\nrate of giving in their chosen fields and investing a portion of\ntheir  investm ent portfolios to support their  philanthropic work.\n\nOnce the foundation has chosen a strategy, it can begin to realign\nits operations.  A foundation, like any enterprise, is a collection of\nmany activities. Each activity-how  proposals are solicited, for\nexample, and how grantees are supported\u2014must be tailored to\nthe chosen strategy  A particularly important aspect of\noperational alignment is the development of measures to help the\nfoundation know whether or not it has been successful.\n\nOperating strategically will require most foundations to rethink\ntheir governance systems. Change will be difficult in an\nenvironment where the pressure of processing grants and getting\nthe money out the door extends beyond the  staff to the\nboardroom. Today boards of all bu t the very  largest foundations\ndiscuss and approve specific grant allocations at th eir meetings.\nWithout goals or strategy, they have no way to delegate the grant\nselection process to staff and no framework through which to\nevaluate their experience.The Chicago-based Crown Foundation,\nin an effort to break this cycle, considers grant requests at only\ntwo of its quarterly board meetings each year; the other two are\nreserved for discussing policy, reviewing performance, and\nstudying issues in more depth. Boards need to move away from\nthe operating function of approving grants to focus on setting\nstrategy and evaluating outcomes.\n\n\n\nWith goals, a strategy, and evaluation mechanisms in place,staff\ncould have greater independence to make grant decisions\nthemselves on a more timely and flexible basis. At the Colorado\nTrust,the board considers and approves multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar initiatives that have clearly defined goals and a clearly\narticulated strategy  Once the board sets the  framework, program\nstaff has the authority to make individual grants for the life of the\ninitiative. Staff members, then, have greater responsibility and\nmore freedom to make decisions on individual grants, and the\nboard  has the tim e to study  the field, set overall strategies, and\nassess staff performance.\n\nFor those who care deeply about social problems and work\ntirelessly to make a difference, current foundation practices not\nonly diminish effectiveness,they inevitably reduce the\nsatisfaction that donors, staff, and trustees derive from their\nwork. Scattered funding, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with\ngrantees, and a lack of awareness of outcomes necessarily create a\ndivide between the foundation and the ultimate results of its\nwork.Acting strategically is much more difficult. But for trustees\nand staff alike, it will be far more rewarding as well.\n\nImproving the performance of philanthropy would enable\nfoundations to have a much greater impact on society.\nFoundations could play a leading role in changing the culture of\nsocial sector management.They could spearhead the evolution of\nphilanthropy from private acts of conscience into a professional\nfield. Until foundations accept their accountability to society and\nmeet their obligation to create value, they exist in a world where\nthey cannot fail.Unfortunately, they also cannot truly succeed.\nA version of this article appeared in the November-December 1999 issue of\nHarvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nMichael E.

Tailoring\nactivities to strategy is the way a foundation institutionalizes and\nreinforces its distinctive strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\ntyranny of the grant cycle, with barely the time to write up\npending grant requests between board meetings.

Fewer than 9% of foundations\n\n\n\nmake 75% or more of their grants in a single field, and only 5%\nfocus more than  90% of their grants in one field. Such scattered\ngiving is inconsistent with a clear strategic positioning.\n\nNor do the data suggest that many foundations are taking\nadvantage of their unique ways to create value. Among the largest\nfoundations,with assets in excess of $1 billion,each professional\nemployee handles approximately seven grants per year (and up to\n100 times as many grant requests). There are, on average, just\nthree professional employees for every field in which the\nfoundation makes grants. Staff at the largest foundations may\nwell have sufficient time and expertise to evaluate grants,but it is\nhard to see how even the most dedicated staff could have much\ntime to assist grantees.  The smaller the foundation, the more\nstretched the staff. Among the hundreds of foundations with $50\nmillion to $250 million in assets, there are five times as many\ngrants per professional,and an average of two staff members\nhandle grants in 11 unrelated fields. The smallest foundations\noften rely on the volunteer efforts of trustees, making it almost\ncertain that many decisions are reached with little formal\nevaluation at all.\n\nThose broad metrics also suggest that foundations are not using\nthe more powerful forms of value creation beyond selection.\nFoundations rarely contribute resources other than financial\nsupport. Only 2.2% of foundation grants were designated to\nimprove the grantees&#x27; performance.Ninety-five percent of all\nfoundation grants are for one year.Although one-year grants are\nsometimes awarded for several years in a row, there is little\nevidence that foundations exploit the opportunity to work more\nclosely with grantees over extended periods of time to improve\ntheir performance. Foundations, which should be able to take the\nlong view tend to focus on grant making quarter-to-quarter.\n\n\n\nFinally, while foundations express a strong interest in innovation\nand advancing the state of knowledge about society&#x27;s problems,\nvery few fund studies that  explore the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent approaches to a given problem. Only 8.8% of foundation\ngrants went to research,and most of that was in basic medical and\nscientific areas. Funding studies or data collection is rare, and\nfoundations generally see them as less desirable than current\nsocial services.\n\nInstead of funding research, many foundations seek to promote\ninnovation through seed grants that are designed to establish and\nsupport specific new programs.There is little benefit, however, in\nstarting new initiatives if they do not survive and grow. Too often\nfoundations overlook projects aimed at fostering the growth and\nreplication of new initiatives, or they fail to support the grantee\nover an appropriately long time span. They rarely do the up-front\nresearch and the postevaluation needed to ascertain if their\nprograms have been successful and have continued to thrive after\nthe initial period of seed grant support.\n\nIn some ways, however, the overall failure to evaluate the results\nof foundation grants is the most telling danger sign of all.Almost\nno money is set aside for program evaluation.Many foundations\nare ambivalent about whether funds should be spent on\nevaluation and whether assessing the performance of past grants\ncan improve future grant making. This ambivalence about\nevaluation is reinforced by the performance criteria used to judge\nfoundation staff. These tend to emphasize the paper trail of\npregrant analysis and recommendations and give little credit for\nachieving the real-world results that motivated the grant in the\nfirst place.Program evaluation,therefore, has only a downside:\nfailure risks censure, but success adds no reward.\n\n\n\nThe evaluations that do take place are often problematic in three\nways. First, they are limited to reports as to whether the money\nwas spent as intended (output evaluation);they do not attempt to\nmeasure social impact (outcome evaluation). Second,many of the\nevaluations are done by the grant recipients themselves, who\ninvariably seek further support from the foundation.How\nobjective and reliable are these reports likely to be? Third,even in\nthe few cases where the social impact of a program is measured by\nan outside consultant, it is usually assessed at the single grantee\nlevel,in isolation from the foundation&#x27;s other grants.Therefore, it\ndoes not reflect the foundation&#x27;s success in reaching its overall\ngoals.\n\nCertainly, evaluation may at times be costly and complex.But\ngiven clear goals at the outset, it is always possible. The criteria to\nevaluate a job-training program will differ from those used to\nevaluate a funding program for young artists. But meaningful\ncriteria can be established for both.\n\nConsider the San Francisco-based Roberts Enterprise\nDevelopment Fund,which focuses on creating employment for\nthe homeless and indigent. Working closely with its grantee\nRubicon Programs, REDF developed 25 criteria that not only\nmeasure the success of job-training programs but also help\nRubicon to manage the programs more effectively. In addition to\nthe most obvious criteria\u2014changes in employment stability\nwages,and job skills\u2014REDF and Rubicon found that related\nfactors such as substance abuse and even qualitative factors such\nas the trainees&#x27; own assessments of their success in reaching\npersonal goals were all meaningful measures of outcomes the\nprogram was trying to achieve.\n\nWithout evaluation, a foundation will never know whether or not\nit has been successful. The most basic premise of strategy-\nstriving for superior performance\u2014is violated if performance is\n\n\n\nnot measured.\n\nAddressing the New Agenda\n\nHow can foundations begin down the path we have outlined? A\nnumber of foundations, including those operating under the new\nrubric of venture philanthropy, are already moving in the\ndirection outlined here. But none that we have encountered has\ngone all the way. Putting these elements together into a coherent\nwhole will require developing a strategy, aligning operations with\nthat strategy, and revising the foundation&#x27;s governance so that the\nstrategy can be monitored effectively. Responsibility for such\nchange lies ultimately with the trustees and directors, who are the\nfiduciaries accountable for the use of the foundation&#x27;s (and\nsociety&#x27;s) funds.\n\nTo develop a strategy  the place to start is positioning. This always\nrequires systematic thought and research into important social\nchallenges that are not being addressed well by others. The goal is\nnot necessarily to identify the most important problem,since\nmany are important.W hat matters is how effectively the\nfou nd at ion  can  co n trib u te  to  its  so lu tion .\n\nSecond, a foundation can learn from prior efforts within its\nchosen area of funding. Do current socioeconomic trends favor\none approach over another? What are other organizations doing\nin  th e  fie ld? Can the  work  of th is  foun da tion  re in fo rce  o r\n\ncomplement theirs? Can we uncover root causes of the problem?\n\nThird,what unique strengths will enable this foundation to create\nvalue most effectively in its field? Part of the answer to this\nquestion comes from examining objectively where the foundation\nhas made the greatest impact in the past. It also comes from a\nre alist ic  assessm e n t  o f w eakne sses.\n\n\n\nScale plays an important role in the choice of strategy. A\nfoundation  needs enough  resources to pursue its particular way of\n\ncreating value.Larger foundations may well have the scale to\nwork in more than one field. If they choose to do so, each area\nmust have its own strategy and tailored operations. All\nfoundations, however, can create more value by putting a greater\nproportion of their resources to work.  This means stepping up the\nrate of giving in their chosen fields and investing a portion of\ntheir  investm ent portfolios to support their  philanthropic work.\n\nOnce the foundation has chosen a strategy, it can begin to realign\nits operations.  A foundation, like any enterprise, is a collection of\nmany activities. Each activity-how  proposals are solicited, for\nexample, and how grantees are supported\u2014must be tailored to\nthe chosen strategy  A particularly important aspect of\noperational alignment is the development of measures to help the\nfoundation know whether or not it has been successful.\n\nOperating strategically will require most foundations to rethink\ntheir governance systems. Change will be difficult in an\nenvironment where the pressure of processing grants and getting\nthe money out the door extends beyond the  staff to the\nboardroom. Today boards of all bu t the very  largest foundations\ndiscuss and approve specific grant allocations at th eir meetings.\nWithout goals or strategy, they have no way to delegate the grant\nselection process to staff and no framework through which to\nevaluate their experience.The Chicago-based Crown Foundation,\nin an effort to break this cycle, considers grant requests at only\ntwo of its quarterly board meetings each year; the other two are\nreserved for discussing policy, reviewing performance, and\nstudying issues in more depth. Boards need to move away from\nthe operating function of approving grants to focus on setting\nstrategy and evaluating outcomes.\n\n\n\nWith goals, a strategy, and evaluation mechanisms in place,staff\ncould have greater independence to make grant decisions\nthemselves on a more timely and flexible basis. At the Colorado\nTrust,the board considers and approves multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar initiatives that have clearly defined goals and a clearly\narticulated strategy  Once the board sets the  framework, program\nstaff has the authority to make individual grants for the life of the\ninitiative. Staff members, then, have greater responsibility and\nmore freedom to make decisions on individual grants, and the\nboard  has the tim e to study  the field, set overall strategies, and\nassess staff performance.\n\nFor those who care deeply about social problems and work\ntirelessly to make a difference, current foundation practices not\nonly diminish effectiveness,they inevitably reduce the\nsatisfaction that donors, staff, and trustees derive from their\nwork. Scattered funding, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with\ngrantees, and a lack of awareness of outcomes necessarily create a\ndivide between the foundation and the ultimate results of its\nwork.Acting strategically is much more difficult. But for trustees\nand staff alike, it will be far more rewarding as well.\n\nImproving the performance of philanthropy would enable\nfoundations to have a much greater impact on society.\nFoundations could play a leading role in changing the culture of\nsocial sector management.They could spearhead the evolution of\nphilanthropy from private acts of conscience into a professional\nfield. Until foundations accept their accountability to society and\nmeet their obligation to create value, they exist in a world where\nthey cannot fail.Unfortunately, they also cannot truly succeed.\nA version of this article appeared in the November-December 1999 issue of\nHarvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nMichael E.

https://www.youtube.com/watch/cJ0gl44Q358\n\n00:00:03.200 in 2009 Forbes magazine wrote an article\n00:00:08.029 that featured me in their heroes of\n00:00:12.750 philanthropy edition something is\n00:00:15.839 actually a little uncomfortable with but\n00:00:18.300 you couldn&#x27;t quite stop them I&#x27;d been\n00:00:20.939 working with my family&#x27;s business at the\n00:00:22.769 time and we were in the process of\n00:00:25.710 opening a hotel and at the same time I\n00:00:30.570 had also been involved with various\n00:00:32.159 nonprofits and it actually found out too\n00:00:36.989 that so many of the migrant workers the\n00:00:41.040 men and women who come to Singapore to\n00:00:42.570 clean to build to service Singapore\n00:00:47.190 we&#x27;re actually paying anywhere from six\n00:00:49.890 months even to two years of their\n00:00:52.590 salaries to labor agents that was not\n00:00:57.210 acceptable so my friend Peter and I\n00:01:00.949 thought about trying to create an\n00:01:04.170 alternative system a different way to\n00:01:07.830 recruit people and so we created a new\n00:01:12.540 process that would cap fees that would\n00:01:16.409 tell the people who are coming here\n00:01:18.150 exactly what they were getting for\n00:01:19.680 anything that they were paying and would\n00:01:21.900 actually help prepare them before they\n00:01:23.820 came to manage their expectations and\n00:01:25.799 actually welcome them once they had\n00:01:29.070 arrived it was important to me that we\n00:01:34.259 were able to help them feel at home so\n00:01:38.159 it was a little more effort than usual\n00:01:40.049 maybe but this was a business that I\n00:01:42.509 could influence in a small way for that\n00:01:45.689 for the better and I didn&#x27;t do it to be\n00:01:47.909 a philanthropist I did it because it was\n00:01:50.700 the right thing to do and maybe that&#x27;s\n00:01:53.640 what being a philanthropist is all about\n00:01:57.560 so what do you think of when you hear\n00:02:00.299 the word philanthropist who or what\n00:02:03.960 comes to mind\n00:02:05.600 tech giant wildly crazy entrepreneur\n00:02:12.390 super savvy investor I guess in many of\n00:02:17.680 our minds it&#x27;s sort of the rich and the\n00:02:19.060 powerful who give away millions if not\n00:02:21.310 billions to rid the world of of\n00:02:23.440 preventable diseases from which millions\n00:02:25.750 die every year or maybe rebuilding\n00:02:28.420 cities or maybe creating education and\n00:02:32.769 investing in disenfranchised populations\n00:02:37.500 but what&#x27;s the problem with this picture\n00:02:40.299 I think the biggest challenge is that\n00:02:43.209 philanthropy and the idea of being a\n00:02:45.549 philanthropist is such a far cry from\n00:02:47.680 everybody&#x27;s everyday life day jobs\n00:02:50.680 childcare managing homework but I&#x27;d like\n00:02:55.030 to challenge this idea about how\n00:02:56.859 philanthropy and the loving of humanity\n00:03:00.159 and the exercise of one values to\n00:03:03.400 benefit another is actually something\n00:03:05.560 that can happen every day by anyone\n00:03:08.140 anywhere in small simple personal and\n00:03:13.150 meaningful ways I&#x27;d like to challenge\n00:03:16.180 the idea that the person you&#x27;d least\n00:03:18.579 expect\n00:03:19.299 could be a philanthropist and that the\n00:03:21.940 sum of many small parts has an enormous\n00:03:24.940 impact and that everyone with some skill\n00:03:28.450 or talent can share and that together we\n00:03:33.849 can create a new culture based on these\n00:03:36.370 ideas so how many of you have raised\n00:03:41.410 funds or funded something on a\n00:03:44.319 crowdfunding site okay reasonable\n00:03:49.150 proportion of you there\n00:03:50.400 well a lot of us think of these sites is\n00:03:53.049 actually being very commercially\n00:03:54.400 oriented but did you know that in 2012\n00:03:58.260 the online site that site Kickstarter\n00:04:02.220 actually exceeded the National Endowment\n00:04:04.810 for the Arts in terms of funds\n00:04:06.910 distributed to arts groups in the United\n00:04:09.040 States and as of this year Kickstarter\n00:04:12.910 has raised one and a half billion\n00:04:15.040 dollars for over 80,000 art projects\n00:04:19.149 that gave aspiring artists theatre\n00:04:21.760 practitioners musicians filmmakers and\n00:04:24.370 the\n00:04:24.970 a chance to realize their dreams with an\n00:04:27.940 average contribution of $25 perhaps\n00:04:35.920 though less obvious are hidden heroes\n00:04:39.010 whose life choices can really inspire us\n00:04:41.610 a couple years ago I vetted I visited\n00:04:44.920 Myanmar and I met this woman Hana so she\n00:04:49.450 was living about an hour and a half\n00:04:50.710 outside of Yangon and she ran an\n00:04:52.600 orphanage with 19 children from the ages\n00:04:54.730 of like 3 months all the way up to 2 18\n00:04:58.270 years old the older kids helped the\n00:05:01.120 younger kids the place was completely\n00:05:02.710 spotless everybody&#x27;s toothbrush was\n00:05:05.080 really neatly lined up in the washing\n00:05:06.940 area and then when I asked her who\n00:05:09.340 supports you she told me a church in\n00:05:13.330 Singapore and my two sons and my first\n00:05:17.740 impression was of course that her two\n00:05:19.150 sons were like doctors lawyers or\n00:05:21.010 accountants or something you know maybe\n00:05:23.290 in Yangon or maybe even expats somewhere\n00:05:26.590 else but I asked her and they were\n00:05:29.620 actually expats but one was a security\n00:05:33.940 guard in a shopping mall and the other\n00:05:36.400 one was a construction worker and so\n00:05:40.090 later that week when I came home I\n00:05:42.090 glanced at that Burmese security guard\n00:05:46.150 and I saw him with new eyes could he\n00:05:49.960 have been the philanthropist that funded\n00:05:52.210 Hannah&#x27;s home I imagined them eating\n00:05:55.840 sparingly not spending very much on\n00:05:58.450 personal luxuries and probably saving\n00:06:00.970 50% of their salaries to remit back home\n00:06:04.510 and then I thought you know that&#x27;s\n00:06:08.020 pretty much what Bill Gates and Warren\n00:06:10.330 Buffett decided to do with the Giving\n00:06:12.100 Pledge back at home last year we\n00:06:15.790 actually also undertook this fascinating\n00:06:18.160 experiment we found two brothers Kauai\n00:06:21.430 and kaha aged 9 and 11 and these two\n00:06:25.630 brothers had posted or I guess their\n00:06:27.490 mother had posted on social media that\n00:06:29.080 they were giving away their own Bao\n00:06:31.240 money you know collected during Chinese\n00:06:33.940 Chinese New Year to the Singapore Cancer\n00:06:36.040 Society I guess they had\n00:06:37.550 family related resonance with that with\n00:06:41.480 the cause and these two brothers had\n00:06:44.870 just decided to do that and so we seize\n00:06:47.150 the day and we said hey let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s\n00:06:48.770 share this idea let&#x27;s tell other people\n00:06:51.170 that you know maybe they could do that\n00:06:52.550 too if even if it&#x27;s 1% 5% or 10% you\n00:06:56.630 know of whatever they could they could\n00:06:58.520 make a giveaway from from their own\n00:07:00.170 phone money to support a cause that just\n00:07:02.270 represented something that their family\n00:07:04.640 cared about and the results were\n00:07:07.520 astounding in the first 20 days of\n00:07:10.760 Chinese New Year donations through our\n00:07:13.040 online site were up 73 percent\n00:07:16.970 year-on-year it was a simple fun and\n00:07:20.330 meaningful idea that every everyone\n00:07:22.640 could participate in and it made all the\n00:07:24.650 difference to the nonprofit&#x27;s that they\n00:07:26.600 supported but giving is a lot more than\n00:07:32.030 just money\n00:07:33.020 it&#x27;s time it&#x27;s loving when you&#x27;re it&#x27;s\n00:07:36.650 loving your neighbor\n00:07:37.610 it&#x27;s person-to-person and it&#x27;s the\n00:07:41.030 offering of even if like our skills so a\n00:07:44.330 great a great Singaporean actually is a\n00:07:47.480 photographer Bob Lee some of you may\n00:07:50.120 have may have heard of him or seen him\n00:07:51.800 too and he was asked to teach\n00:07:54.440 photography to the blind he was called\n00:07:58.640 one day by a charity dialogue in the\n00:08:00.320 dark and and and given this intriguing\n00:08:04.040 offer sponsors had come in to help\n00:08:07.040 provide cameras printing services and\n00:08:09.230 space and everything and and Bob began\n00:08:12.830 to teach and one of his students was it\n00:08:17.390 was a gentleman called an elderly\n00:08:18.950 gentleman called uncle William and he\n00:08:20.780 produced his first photograph as you can\n00:08:22.970 see here kind of like cut off legs of\n00:08:26.000 someone and a dustbin and Bob asked him\n00:08:30.110 what&#x27;s what&#x27;s that about William we\n00:08:32.840 didn&#x27;t quite get the composition quite\n00:08:34.880 quite right but Uncle William told him\n00:08:38.390 well actually it&#x27;s about the dustbin and\n00:08:42.340 and Bob said okay well how does that\n00:08:44.870 actually work and he said well you know\n00:08:47.930 every day when I when I take this route\n00:08:50.090 he\n00:08:50.720 no to to go to work I look for that\n00:08:53.449 dustbin because when I hit it it tells\n00:08:55.160 me to turn so that I can cross but one\n00:08:59.509 day this cleaner actually moved the\n00:09:01.189 dustbin and I need him to put it back\n00:09:04.389 and Bob realized that sharing his skill\n00:09:11.439 gave him a view into a whole new world\n00:09:14.170 that he was seeing the world with fresh\n00:09:16.759 eyes and with deeper compassion as a\n00:09:19.370 result so maybe you can take photographs\n00:09:23.060 maybe you can cook maybe you can do\n00:09:26.509 accounts maybe you can write stories or\n00:09:29.180 maybe you&#x27;re just a really good\n00:09:30.410 listening ear how could you use your\n00:09:33.949 skill in service of someone else\n00:09:40.810 my friend Wally uses his company and his\n00:09:45.500 voice he&#x27;s a filmmaker and he raises\n00:09:48.649 awareness or he&#x27;s sought to raise\n00:09:50.209 awareness when he&#x27;s not like making\n00:09:53.120 videos of like wedding or weddings or\n00:09:55.040 doing beautiful food photography that he\n00:09:58.670 decided he was going to do something to\n00:10:00.170 combat this this haze which has kind of\n00:10:01.939 been enveloping you know our our whole\n00:10:04.250 our whole region recently and he decided\n00:10:06.740 that instead of just like moaning about\n00:10:08.959 it like most of us that he was actually\n00:10:11.629 going to crowdfund for masks and for air\n00:10:14.779 quality monitors and he was going to go\n00:10:17.930 with volunteers down to Kalimantan to\n00:10:21.259 distribute them and help educate the\n00:10:23.240 local the local people there and he did\n00:10:27.230 this at a time when of course most of us\n00:10:31.220 were just moaning about a 400 you know\n00:10:35.209 pia PM 2.5 and and he told me that when\n00:10:39.439 he went to Kalimantan the monitors\n00:10:41.959 actually didn&#x27;t work but the year but\n00:10:43.459 the app with the actual PM 2.5 levels\n00:10:46.370 there were actually in excess of 2\n00:10:48.050 million society is made better because\n00:10:51.319 of Wally&#x27;s who share their voice Bob&#x27;s\n00:10:54.259 who share their skill and families like\n00:10:57.350 kaho and kauai who teach the next\n00:11:00.529 generation the values of generosity and\n00:11:03.319 the love for human\n00:11:05.680 society is better because of the two\n00:11:07.880 nameless sons of Hana for practicing\n00:11:11.270 their radical love so my dream is to see\n00:11:15.170 all these parts and pieces connected in\n00:11:17.390 a big Network where skills voices funds\n00:11:22.040 ideas are all shared in one place in our\n00:11:24.890 city and what if we were able to\n00:11:28.370 actually create a marketplace where the\n00:11:30.770 whole city comes together and can we\n00:11:33.080 create for our common good\n00:11:35.680 what if neighbors knew what was needed\n00:11:38.180 and that those needs could be met in a\n00:11:41.330 timely in a timely way with available\n00:11:44.300 resources we all have some margin to\n00:11:48.560 spare and to share we all have influence\n00:11:52.040 and voice and we have friends and\n00:11:54.680 colleagues and family members to reach\n00:11:56.870 out to and I believe that we all have\n00:11:59.660 dreams of being lovers of humanity in a\n00:12:03.740 city of good my colleagues and I are now\n00:12:07.760 imagining and trying to build this\n00:12:09.320 giving platform so we can be Wally&#x27;s\n00:12:11.750 Bob&#x27;s or Hannah&#x27;s children or we can\n00:12:14.330 support them with our voice our skills\n00:12:17.390 or our funds as an expression of our\n00:12:19.460 love and we are well aware that\n00:12:22.130 technology is not the solution but\n00:12:24.980 purely an enabler for philanthropy and\n00:12:27.020 acts of love to be expressed so look\n00:12:31.520 around you I think you&#x27;ll see a\n00:12:34.340 philanthropist waiting to be discovered\n00:12:37.510 thank you\n00:12:46.310 you\n", "title": "tactiq-free-transcript-cJ0gl44Q358.txt", "tether_id": null}, "status":

VATIONReview\nInforming and inspiring leaders of social change\n\nPhilanthropy&amp; Funding\n\n12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and\nSome Answers\nCritics have argued that charitable giving isn&#x27;t focused enough on the poor, isn&#x27;t sufficient to make a difference,\nis undemocratic, and more, but research\u2014and history\u2014show otherwise.\n\nBy Karl Zinsmeister | May 17, 2016\n\nSince January, I&#x27;ve been traveling around the United States talking to audiences about my new book,\n\nThe  Almanac of American Philanthropy, and how private giving affects our nation. During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings. Consider the the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge,which raised money for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s\nDisease research.The initiative occasioned snickers and sniping from some professional\n\nphilanthropists, but donations it generated led to a major scientific breakthrough at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and pre-funding of clinical trials for new therapies.\n\nThere are many more examples. Crusades against autism by Bernie Marcus,against prostate cancer by\nMichael Milken, and against breast cancer by Nancy Brinker were all thought quixotic when they kicked\n\noff, yet each paid huge dividends. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute, and Markey fellowships would never have seen the light of day if many professionals\n\nhad had their way. And it was support from the Guggenheim family that allowed physicist Robert\nGoddard to overcome scorn from other scientists and ridicule by the New York Times to become the\n\ngenius of rocketry and father of America&#x27;s success in space.\n\nAmerica&#x27;s strong system of decentralized giving and homegrown problem-solving supports wide\n\nexperimentation and avoids putting all of our eggs in one national basket.\n\n5. Philanthropic aid lacks standardization! It&#x27;s a chaotic patchwork!\n\nThe lesson of the Internet is the accumulated power of millions of small actions. The story of today&#x27;s\n\nhacker culture is that one individual with a laptop can do astonishing things.Small-scale action that\nlacks uniformity should not be considered a failing.It&#x27;s not chaos,it&#x27;s crowdsourcing\u2014hordes of\neveryday people taking lots of small bites at a problem and eventually chewing through even very big\nissues.\n\nThere are rich examples of the power of dispersed decision-making throughout biology and across\nhuman history. Many of our most effective charities discovered the power of decentralization\ngenerations ago. Each of the I,4oo local chapters of Habitat for Humanity, for example,are independent\n\n3/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nentities with their own rules, practices, and funding. All of the 164 regional branches of Goodwill have\ntheir own boards of directors, and are autonomous in policy and funding; the central office is tiny\ncompared to working affiliates in cities like Milwaukee and Houston.And the Appalachian Mountain\nClub efficiently maintains thousands of miles of hiking trails through a network of local branches\n\nThis same principle of accomplishing important tasks through loosely coupled teams or networks of\nindependent actors is also a powerful trend in many of today&#x27;s most successful private businesses. Every\n\nUber city in America has different fares,different products, different practices. Philanthropy can be\nproud of having been a pioneer in solving problems via a flexible ecosystem of participants, rather than\n\nby following standardized formulas.\n\n6. Charity may work for individuals, but what we really need are solutions that benefit entire groups!\n\nAmbitious people may look at the \u201cone soul at a time&quot; model prevalent in philanthropy and conclude\nthat it&#x27;s just too slow. But that perspective misunderstands what social reclamation usually requires. For\n\ntough problems like addiction and recidivism, the most successful solutions rely heavily on one-to-one\nhuman accountability. They take advantage of the useful information available when we actually know\n\nsomeone, instead of dealing with a stranger. By creating personal instead of impersonal transactions, we\n\ncan wield the power of relationships to teach and change behavior.\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to romanticize the &quot;consistency&quot; of government programs, and contrast it favorably to the\ncrazy-quilt of individualized variations in charitable aid, but consistency is not really how humans work.\nIf you have one child who needs a very structured environment and another who blooms when left to\n\nnavigate on her own, you don&#x27;t want one-size-fits-all schools; you want individualized services that\nrecognize and work with intimate differences of personality. You&#x27;ll have a hard time finding that in\ngovernment-run programs, but it&#x27;s a hallmark of philanthropic efforts.\n\nBen Franklin was one of the first donors to argue that philanthropy shouldn&#x27;t just transfer funds in an\n\nattempt to relieve men in their misfortune. It should help build up individuals into a healthier state.\n\nThe goal of charitable aid in the United States has always been individual competence and\n\nindependence\u2014not just social quiet. And this often requires a personal touch, real mentoring, and one-\non-one aid of the sort many philanthropic efforts emphasize.\n\n7. Philanthropy is undemocratic!\n\n4/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nSome critics,especially from the left,complain that donors accumulate too much power and that their\nmoney lets them impose their point of view on society. But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year. Measured against the $36o billion of cash that\nAmericans donate annually, and nearly that much more in the value of volunteered time,Gates\nFoundation commands less than I percent of our annual philanthropy. That is not an unhealthy\n\nconcentration of power.\n\nAmerican philanthropy is also diverse and diffuse. Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing. Philanthropy is not\njust a sign of self-rule,but also a source  of it\u2014a kind of nursery for broader loyalties to one&#x27;s fellow\n\ncitizens. A healthy democracy should encourage,not discourage,people from acting on their own to\n\nimprove what they judge to be the common good.\n\n8 .  Only government can lead important social change in a fair way!\n\nHistory tells a different story. Private donors and volunteers created the first schools,missions, colleges,\n\nand apprenticeships for Indians and African Americans,often in the face of state resistance.At the\n\nsame time government was enforcing Jim Crow laws,philanthropist Julius Rosenwald erected 4,977\n\nrural schools across America&#x27;s black belt. At the time of his death, 27 percent of all African American\n\nchildren in the United States were educated in one of the schools he built\n\n5/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThose who view such examples as ancient history and believe that all necessary reforms now flow from\ngovernment are gravely mistaken. According to the UCLA Civil Rights Project, America&#x27;s most\n\nsegregated and often most inadequate government-run schools are all in northern cities with activist\n\ngovernments: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In fact,the country&#x27;s\n\nmost segregated schools are in New York state, thanks to New York City, where the proportion of\n\nschools in which at least go percent of the students are black or Hispanic rose sharply from 1989 to\n2OIO.\n\nIt is private philanthropy that is shaking up New York City&#x27;s complacent educational establishment\ntoday by launching charter schools. There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J. Paul Getty, Leland Stanford,\nRussell Sage, and John MacArthur were known to exhibit shabby behavior. (Stanford, for example,\n\nemployed stock watering, kickbacks,bribery, and collusion.) Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints. Adam Smith taught us that\nfreely conducted commerce can take normal human behaviors\u2014including ugly and mercenary on es -\nand turn them to broadly productive uses.The same is true in the world of philanthropy.Part of the\nmagic of America&#x27;s charitable structure is that it can convert common human impulses into truth,\nuplift, and beauty for all of society.\n\nIo . Philanthropy distracts people who ought to focus on business!\n\nThe right side of the political spectrum sometimes complains that philanthropy drags too many\nproductive business people into do-gooding,distracting them from creating the commercial bounty that\n\n6/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nsociety counts on. But there are reasons to think that philanthropy actually strengthens capitalism.\n\nEconomists Zoltan Acs and Ronnie Phillips have observed that the United States has a distinctive\n\nmeans of \u201creconstituting\u201d wealth via philanthropy.\u201cPhilanthropy is part of the implicit social contract\nthat continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity,&quot; they write. Researchers Tino and Nima\nSanandaji agree that the \u201clegitimacy of American capitalism has in part been upheld through voluntary\ndonations.&quot; They note that &quot;much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to society.\n\nThis has had several feedback effects on capitalism. For one, the practice has limited the rise of new\ndynasties. Another positive feedback mechanism is that the donations to research and higher education\nhave allowed new generations to become wealthy?\n\nII. Philanthropy encourages collective thinking, collective responsibility, and collective action\u2014\nultimately leading to more government!\n\nThis is another concern sometimes launched from the libertarian right, where observers argue that\n\nwhat American society really needs is more individual responsibility, not more giveaways. However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations.

Porter and Mark R. Kramer\n\nFrom the Magazine (November-December 1999)\n\nDuring the past two decades,the number of charitable\nfoundations in the United States has doubled,while the value of\ntheir assets has increased more than 1,100%.Foundations now\nhold over $330 billion in assets and contribute over $20 billion\nannually to educational, humanitarian,and cultural\norganizations of all kinds. No other country in the world can\nclaim such substantial and widespread commitment to\nphilanthropy and volunteerism. But are we, as a society realizing\nthe full fruits of this commitment?\n\nGrant-giving foundations are intermediaries between the\nindividual donors who fund them and the various social\nenterprises that they, in turn, support. But if foundations serve\nonly as passive middlemen, as mere conduits for giving, then they\nfall far short of their potential and of society&#x27;s high expectations.\n\nFoundations can and should lead social progress. They have the\npotential to make more effective use of scarce resources than\neither individual donors or the government. Free from political\npressures,foundations can explore new solutions to social\nproblems with an independence tha t government can never have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations Create Value in  Four Ways\n\nOne grant\nX\n\nMultiple grants\n3X-5X\n\nEntire operating budget of one organization\n\n50X-100X\n\nEntire field\n\n&gt;1,000X\n\nmillionsDollar value of resources affected by foundation activity\n\nEach successive approach leverages a foundation&#x27;s\n\nspecial assets more than the preceding one as the pool\no f  \u22ef\n\nV\n\n1. Selecting the Best Grantees.\n\nThe process of value creation here is straightforward. Like\ninvestment advisers in the business world,foundations can use\ntheir expertise to channel resources to their most productive uses\nwithin the social sector by funding organizations that are the\nmost cost effective or that address urgent or overlooked problems.\nFor example,of the many organizations that seek funding for\nprograms aimed at reducing the high school dropout rate, a\nfoundation can select the most effective one.Thus its dollar will\n\nearn a higher social return than a dollar given less knowledgeably\nby an individual donor. In this way, choosing recipients and\nallocating funds is itself a source of value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpertise to benefit from the increased tourism. The Packard\nFoundation&#x27;s grant paid for marketing consultants who taught\nCEDO how to turn  tourists  into members, creating an ongoing\nrevenue stream for CEDO far greater than the Foundation&#x27;s\n$50,000 grant.\n\nThe Echoing Green Foundation, created by venture capitalist Ed\nCohen,gives $1.4 million a year to improve the performance of the\nnonprofit sector even more broadly. It invests in social\nentrepreneurs, individuals with the drive and vision to catalyze\nsocial change. It aims to build a community of public-service\nleaders who share their experience, knowledge, and energy with\none another. To date, Echoing Green has funded more than 300\nfellows who not only pursue their own projects but also visit with\none another to share best practices. The lessons learned are\nrecorded, distributed to all grantees,and made publicly available.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, for example, the Charles and Helen Schwab\nFamily Foundation in San Mateo, California, joined with the\nPeninsula Community Foundation and the Sobrato Foundation in\na $2 million,two-year initiative to address internal issues of\nmanagement and growth at 16 local family-service agencies.\nEvery eight weeks for the life of the project, foundation staff\nmembers meet with all 16 agency directors. Management experts\nare brought in to address relevant topics. As a result of the group\ndiscussions, three of the grantees have decided that they ca\n\nThe range of ways in which foundations can assist nonprofits goes\nwell beyond making management-development grants.\nFoundations can become fully engaged partners, providing\nadvice, management assistance,access to professional service\nfirms, clout, and a host of other non-cash resources. Improving\nthe  performance of grant recipients often requires foundations to\nwork closely with grantees. It also requires the willingness to\nengage for the long term. Foundations are capable of both.\n\nn\n\n\n\noperate more efficiently if they merge,and foundation staff has\nworked closely with them to accomplish the merger. Because\ntechnology management has surfaced as a major issue, the\nfoundations have researched and funded technology needs at\nseveral of the agencies.\n\n4 .  Advancing the State of Knowledge and Practice.\n\nFoundations can create the greatest value by funding research\nand a systematic progression of projects that produce more\neffective ways to address social problems.At its best, such work\nresults in a new framework that shapes subsequent work in the\nfield-making every dollar spent by philanthropists, government,\nand other organizations more productive.\n\nWithin six years,India doubled its rice production, and Mexico,\nonce an importer of wheat, became an exporter. Nigeria and\nColombia created  their  own research institutes  modeled  on  the\nfoundations&#x27; research.  The Rockefeller Foundation subsequently\ndisseminated its results to organizations from 28 developing\ncountries. Altogether, many millions of the world&#x27;s poorest people\nbenefited from the knowledge created by those two foundations\n\nFoundations are uniquely positioned to study a field in depth.\nThey can set a new agenda and change both public sentiment and\ngovernment policy. The green revolution, for example, had its\nroots in research sponsored jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller\nFoundations in the late 1950s and early 1960s.Concerned with\nworld hunger and population growth, the two foundations\ncreated research institutes that developed new strains of wheat\nand rice tha t doubled and tripled crop output per acre.\n\n.\n\nStudies by the Carnegie Foundation have had a similarly powerful\nimpact on education in the United States over the last 95 years. In\n1904,Carnegie funded research by Abraham Flexner on the state\nof medical education, which revealed a widespread lack of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the field of education, the Philanthropic Ventures Foundation\nin Oakland, California, for example, focuses on grassroots\nfunding. In 1995, PVF created the Teacher Resource Grants\nprogram. Working within the large field of education, PVF chose a\nspecialized positioning appropriate to its small size. PVF provides\ninexpensive but badly needed classroom materials to teachers in\nits region\u2014materials that are useless if they don&#x27;t arrive quickly,\nwhen the teacher needs them.\n\nPVF notified more than 6,000 teachers that grants of up to $1,500\nwould be available for classroom materials,field trip s, or teacher\ntraining courses.(After a year of experience, PVF lowered the\nceiling to $500 per grant.) Teachers refer to the program as the\n\u201cfax-grant program\u201d because the foundation takes requests by fax,\nand then sends an answer within one hour of receipt and a check\nwithin 24 hours.\n\nSince its positioning is to help under-resourced teachers and it\nmakes thousands of small grants, the Philanthropic Ventures\nFoundation developed a no-paperwork rule, freeing teachers from\ntime-consuming grant applications.PVF finds that an elaborate\nprocess around  the receipt, investigation, consideration, and\n\nfunding of grant requests is not necessary in its chosen area.\n\nPVF is a perfect example of a foundation that tailored its activities\nto create value. Only by doing things differently from others, in a\nway that is linked tightly to what the foundation seeks to\naccomplish, can it achieve greater impact with the same grant\ndollars or enable its grantees to be more successful. Tailoring\nactivities to strategy is the way a foundation institutionalizes and\nreinforces its distinctive strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\ntyranny of the grant cycle, with barely the time to write up\npending grant requests between board meetings.

Fewer than 9% of foundations\n\n\n\nmake 75% or more of their grants in a single field, and only 5%\nfocus more than  90% of their grants in one field. Such scattered\ngiving is inconsistent with a clear strategic positioning.\n\nNor do the data suggest that many foundations are taking\nadvantage of their unique ways to create value. Among the largest\nfoundations,with assets in excess of $1 billion,each professional\nemployee handles approximately seven grants per year (and up to\n100 times as many grant requests). There are, on average, just\nthree professional employees for every field in which the\nfoundation makes grants. Staff at the largest foundations may\nwell have sufficient time and expertise to evaluate grants,but it is\nhard to see how even the most dedicated staff could have much\ntime to assist grantees.  The smaller the foundation, the more\nstretched the staff. Among the hundreds of foundations with $50\nmillion to $250 million in assets, there are five times as many\ngrants per professional,and an average of two staff members\nhandle grants in 11 unrelated fields. The smallest foundations\noften rely on the volunteer efforts of trustees, making it almost\ncertain that many decisions are reached with little formal\nevaluation at all.\n\nThose broad metrics also suggest that foundations are not using\nthe more powerful forms of value creation beyond selection.\nFoundations rarely contribute resources other than financial\nsupport. Only 2.2% of foundation grants were designated to\nimprove the grantees&#x27; performance.Ninety-five percent of all\nfoundation grants are for one year.Although one-year grants are\nsometimes awarded for several years in a row, there is little\nevidence that foundations exploit the opportunity to work more\nclosely with grantees over extended periods of time to improve\ntheir performance. Foundations, which should be able to take the\nlong view tend to focus on grant making quarter-to-quarter.\n\n\n\nFinally, while foundations express a strong interest in innovation\nand advancing the state of knowledge about society&#x27;s problems,\nvery few fund studies that  explore the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent approaches to a given problem. Only 8.8% of foundation\ngrants went to research,and most of that was in basic medical and\nscientific areas. Funding studies or data collection is rare, and\nfoundations generally see them as less desirable than current\nsocial services.\n\nInstead of funding research, many foundations seek to promote\ninnovation through seed grants that are designed to establish and\nsupport specific new programs.There is little benefit, however, in\nstarting new initiatives if they do not survive and grow. Too often\nfoundations overlook projects aimed at fostering the growth and\nreplication of new initiatives, or they fail to support the grantee\nover an appropriately long time span. They rarely do the up-front\nresearch and the postevaluation needed to ascertain if their\nprograms have been successful and have continued to thrive after\nthe initial period of seed grant support.\n\nIn some ways, however, the overall failure to evaluate the results\nof foundation grants is the most telling danger sign of all.Almost\nno money is set aside for program evaluation.Many foundations\nare ambivalent about whether funds should be spent on\nevaluation and whether assessing the performance of past grants\ncan improve future grant making. This ambivalence about\nevaluation is reinforced by the performance criteria used to judge\nfoundation staff. These tend to emphasize the paper trail of\npregrant analysis and recommendations and give little credit for\nachieving the real-world results that motivated the grant in the\nfirst place.Program evaluation,therefore, has only a downside:\nfailure risks censure, but success adds no reward.\n\n\n\nThe evaluations that do take place are often problematic in three\nways. First, they are limited to reports as to whether the money\nwas spent as intended (output evaluation);they do not attempt to\nmeasure social impact (outcome evaluation). Second,many of the\nevaluations are done by the grant recipients themselves, who\ninvariably seek further support from the foundation.How\nobjective and reliable are these reports likely to be? Third,even in\nthe few cases where the social impact of a program is measured by\nan outside consultant, it is usually assessed at the single grantee\nlevel,in isolation from the foundation&#x27;s other grants.Therefore, it\ndoes not reflect the foundation&#x27;s success in reaching its overall\ngoals.\n\nCertainly, evaluation may at times be costly and complex.But\ngiven clear goals at the outset, it is always possible. The criteria to\nevaluate a job-training program will differ from those used to\nevaluate a funding program for young artists. But meaningful\ncriteria can be established for both.\n\nConsider the San Francisco-based Roberts Enterprise\nDevelopment Fund,which focuses on creating employment for\nthe homeless and indigent. Working closely with its grantee\nRubicon Programs, REDF developed 25 criteria that not only\nmeasure the success of job-training programs but also help\nRubicon to manage the programs more effectively. In addition to\nthe most obvious criteria\u2014changes in employment stability\nwages,and job skills\u2014REDF and Rubicon found that related\nfactors such as substance abuse and even qualitative factors such\nas the trainees&#x27; own assessments of their success in reaching\npersonal goals were all meaningful measures of outcomes the\nprogram was trying to achieve.\n\nWithout evaluation, a foundation will never know whether or not\nit has been successful. The most basic premise of strategy-\nstriving for superior performance\u2014is violated if performance is\n\n\n\nnot measured.\n\nAddressing the New Agenda\n\nHow can foundations begin down the path we have outlined? A\nnumber of foundations, including those operating under the new\nrubric of venture philanthropy, are already moving in the\ndirection outlined here. But none that we have encountered has\ngone all the way. Putting these elements together into a coherent\nwhole will require developing a strategy, aligning operations with\nthat strategy, and revising the foundation&#x27;s governance so that the\nstrategy can be monitored effectively. Responsibility for such\nchange lies ultimately with the trustees and directors, who are the\nfiduciaries accountable for the use of the foundation&#x27;s (and\nsociety&#x27;s) funds.\n\nTo develop a strategy  the place to start is positioning. This always\nrequires systematic thought and research into important social\nchallenges that are not being addressed well by others. The goal is\nnot necessarily to identify the most important problem,since\nmany are important.W hat matters is how effectively the\nfou nd at ion  can  co n trib u te  to  its  so lu tion .\n\nSecond, a foundation can learn from prior efforts within its\nchosen area of funding. Do current socioeconomic trends favor\none approach over another? What are other organizations doing\nin  th e  fie ld? Can the  work  of th is  foun da tion  re in fo rce  o r\n\ncomplement theirs? Can we uncover root causes of the problem?\n\nThird,what unique strengths will enable this foundation to create\nvalue most effectively in its field? Part of the answer to this\nquestion comes from examining objectively where the foundation\nhas made the greatest impact in the past. It also comes from a\nre alist ic  assessm e n t  o f w eakne sses.\n\n\n\nScale plays an important role in the choice of strategy. A\nfoundation  needs enough  resources to pursue its particular way of\n\ncreating value.Larger foundations may well have the scale to\nwork in more than one field. If they choose to do so, each area\nmust have its own strategy and tailored operations. All\nfoundations, however, can create more value by putting a greater\nproportion of their resources to work.  This means stepping up the\nrate of giving in their chosen fields and investing a portion of\ntheir  investm ent portfolios to support their  philanthropic work.\n\nOnce the foundation has chosen a strategy, it can begin to realign\nits operations.  A foundation, like any enterprise, is a collection of\nmany activities. Each activity-how  proposals are solicited, for\nexample, and how grantees are supported\u2014must be tailored to\nthe chosen strategy  A particularly important aspect of\noperational alignment is the development of measures to help the\nfoundation know whether or not it has been successful.\n\nOperating strategically will require most foundations to rethink\ntheir governance systems. Change will be difficult in an\nenvironment where the pressure of processing grants and getting\nthe money out the door extends beyond the  staff to the\nboardroom. Today boards of all bu t the very  largest foundations\ndiscuss and approve specific grant allocations at th eir meetings.\nWithout goals or strategy, they have no way to delegate the grant\nselection process to staff and no framework through which to\nevaluate their experience.The Chicago-based Crown Foundation,\nin an effort to break this cycle, considers grant requests at only\ntwo of its quarterly board meetings each year; the other two are\nreserved for discussing policy, reviewing performance, and\nstudying issues in more depth. Boards need to move away from\nthe operating function of approving grants to focus on setting\nstrategy and evaluating outcomes.\n\n\n\nWith goals, a strategy, and evaluation mechanisms in place,staff\ncould have greater independence to make grant decisions\nthemselves on a more timely and flexible basis. At the Colorado\nTrust,the board considers and approves multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar initiatives that have clearly defined goals and a clearly\narticulated strategy  Once the board sets the  framework, program\nstaff has the authority to make individual grants for the life of the\ninitiative. Staff members, then, have greater responsibility and\nmore freedom to make decisions on individual grants, and the\nboard  has the tim e to study  the field, set overall strategies, and\nassess staff performance.\n\nFor those who care deeply about social problems and work\ntirelessly to make a difference, current foundation practices not\nonly diminish effectiveness,they inevitably reduce the\nsatisfaction that donors, staff, and trustees derive from their\nwork. Scattered funding, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with\ngrantees, and a lack of awareness of outcomes necessarily create a\ndivide between the foundation and the ultimate results of its\nwork.Acting strategically is much more difficult. But for trustees\nand staff alike, it will be far more rewarding as well.\n\nImproving the performance of philanthropy would enable\nfoundations to have a much greater impact on society.\nFoundations could play a leading role in changing the culture of\nsocial sector management.They could spearhead the evolution of\nphilanthropy from private acts of conscience into a professional\nfield. Until foundations accept their accountability to society and\nmeet their obligation to create value, they exist in a world where\nthey cannot fail.Unfortunately, they also cannot truly succeed.\nA version of this article appeared in the November-December 1999 issue of\nHarvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nMichael E.

do\n00:01:15.720 something that might help my country if\n00:01:17.759 I did a good job in government so I got\n00:01:19.640 a scholarship to Duke University I got a\n00:01:21.720 scholarship to univ Chicago law school\n00:01:23.600 and then I went to work in a law firm in\n00:01:25.040 New York that a partner at which was the\n00:01:27.600 man who wrote that speech for John\n00:01:29.119 Kennedy his name was Ted s the greatest\n00:01:30.720 presidential speech writer I think of\n00:01:32.079 all time and after a few years of\n00:01:34.240 working for him um he s of hinted maybe\n00:01:37.000 that I wasn&#x27;t such a great lawyer maybe\n00:01:38.479 I should do something different and I\n00:01:40.560 talked to my clients and I said well you\n00:01:42.200 know I might do something different what\n00:01:43.399 do you think they said now&#x27;s a good time\n00:01:44.680 to leave so I got the idea that I\n00:01:46.680 probably wasn&#x27;t a great lawyer and Ted\n00:01:48.640 saon got me an interview with a man he\n00:01:50.600 said we&#x27; be the next president United\n00:01:51.840 States I could work in the White House\n00:01:53.000 just as he had done for President\n00:01:54.079 Kennedy I got a job as the chief counsel\n00:01:56.200 for a man named burby who was running\n00:01:58.680 for president in 1976\n00:02:00.360 30 days after I joined his um Senate\n00:02:02.600 staff he dropped out of his presidential\n00:02:04.039 campaign so I said uhoh maybe this\n00:02:06.000 happened to some to you as well I wasn&#x27;t\n00:02:08.080 a good lawyer my clients didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:09.479 was good my colleagues didn&#x27;t think I\n00:02:10.758 was good I went to join a campaign in\n00:02:13.520 effect it it ended after 30 days and\n00:02:15.560 then I got a call out of the blue some\n00:02:16.879 of you may have in your career as well\n00:02:18.560 it said uh would you like to work for\n00:02:20.519 another man running for president who is\n00:02:22.120 this Jimmy Carter and I said well he&#x27;s\n00:02:23.680 the peanut farmer from Georgia and they\n00:02:25.080 said yes he&#x27;s going to be the nominee\n00:02:26.120 for Democratic party in&#x27; 76 I got the\n00:02:28.000 interview I went down to Georgia Carter\n00:02:30.280 was 33 points ahead when I joined his\n00:02:32.000 campaign he won by one point so he he\n00:02:34.840 often said to me you know what did you\n00:02:36.200 really contribute but White House staffs\n00:02:37.680 are not filled on Merit they&#x27;re filled\n00:02:38.879 on who worked in the campaign so I\n00:02:40.519 became the deputy domestic policy\n00:02:42.040 adviser at the president United States\n00:02:43.280 at the age of 27 three years out of law\n00:02:45.200 school I wasn&#x27;t qualified for that job\n00:02:47.080 he wasn&#x27;t qualified for his job so I\n00:02:48.440 figured we fit in\n00:02:50.400 um I managed to get inflation to 19% in\n00:02:53.680 my job very difficult to get inflation\n00:02:55.560 19% nobody&#x27;s done it since um there was\n00:02:58.280 a rumor that I was going to be promoted\n00:02:59.680 in the second term to be the senior\n00:03:01.200 domestic adviser if Carter&#x27;s reelected\n00:03:03.040 and on the strength of that rumor\n00:03:04.080 President Carter thinks he lost the\n00:03:05.239 election so I had to go find a job I\n00:03:07.400 went back and practice law in Washington\n00:03:08.959 it took me many months to convince\n00:03:10.120 somebody I knew how to do something in\n00:03:11.560 practicing law after finding myself\n00:03:13.920 being humiliated because I was a White\n00:03:15.400 House Aid one day next day I couldn&#x27;t\n00:03:16.680 get a job at practicing law finally\n00:03:18.159 somebody felt sorry for me I practiced\n00:03:19.920 law but once again my client said to me\n00:03:21.959 you know this might not be for you and I\n00:03:24.080 said to my my partners what do you think\n00:03:25.920 about this should I stay and they said\n00:03:27.280 maybe not so I decided I would and I\n00:03:30.200 took a chance I read that on average an\n00:03:31.959 entrepreneur starts a company between\n00:03:33.400 the ages of 28 and 37 and I read that\n00:03:35.599 when I was 37 so I said okay I&#x27;m going\n00:03:38.120 to start a company so without knowing\n00:03:39.959 anything about Finance I decided to\n00:03:41.519 start something called the carw group\n00:03:43.640 and I started in Pennsylvania Avenue I\n00:03:45.280 recruited three people actually knew\n00:03:46.480 something about Finance I told them I\n00:03:48.159 had some money but I really was\n00:03:49.280 exaggerating I told him when they showed\n00:03:51.080 up I would get the money so ultimately\n00:03:53.400 uh we start a company with $5 million\n00:03:55.239 today we manage $200 billion and it&#x27;s\n00:03:57.519 turned out to be one of the largest\n00:03:58.480 private Equity firms in the world when I\n00:04:00.239 hit the age of 54 Forbes Magazine put a\n00:04:02.879 story out about my net worth and my\n00:04:04.599 partner&#x27;s net worth and it became\n00:04:05.920 obvious to me that I had made so much\n00:04:07.920 money that I couldn&#x27;t possibly spend it\n00:04:09.599 on on houses and planes and boats and so\n00:04:12.319 forth which I didn&#x27;t really care much\n00:04:13.720 about anyway so I decided what I would\n00:04:15.400 try to do is atone for my sins getting\n00:04:17.399 inflation to 19% and maybe give it back\n00:04:19.759 to the UN government give back to the US\n00:04:21.560 government give back to my country but I\n00:04:23.160 wasn&#x27;t sure how to do it and it came\n00:04:24.520 about in a kind of U unusual way one day\n00:04:27.600 I was invited to an uh an auction in in\n00:04:29.800 New York I was told I would be able to\n00:04:31.360 see the Magna Carta and I said how can\n00:04:33.440 you see the Magna Carta it&#x27;s in England\n00:04:34.720 it turned out there are 17 copies of the\n00:04:36.560 Magna Carta and I had a chance to to see\n00:04:38.960 one of them it was the only one in\n00:04:40.080 private hands I decided that I would try\n00:04:41.919 to buy that and make sure it stayed in\n00:04:43.360 the United States because it was\n00:04:44.280 probably going to be auctioned off I was\n00:04:45.440 told by the auctioneer and leave the\n00:04:47.000 country so I went back that next night I\n00:04:49.039 bought it and I now put it on display at\n00:04:50.880 the National Archives it&#x27;ll be there\n00:04:52.080 permanently and I said I&#x27;ll do this for\n00:04:53.759 the for the country is a way to kind of\n00:04:55.440 make sure this document which was the\n00:04:56.880 inspiration for the Declaration of\n00:04:58.080 Independence the Bill of Rights the\n00:04:59.680 Constitution stays here and then other\n00:05:01.479 documents came available the declaration\n00:05:03.199 independence the Emancipation\n00:05:04.360 Proclamation the 13th Amendment which\n00:05:05.800 Freeds slaves the Constitution the Bill\n00:05:07.720 of Rights and I bought rare copies of\n00:05:09.400 them and put them on display at the\n00:05:10.600 state department the national\n00:05:12.320 Constitution Center the Smithsonian the\n00:05:14.120 library Congress as a way of saying to\n00:05:16.240 Americans take a look at these and learn\n00:05:17.919 more about your history in a recent Pew\n00:05:19.800 survey it turned out that 35% of\n00:05:21.840 Americans when they asked what river did\n00:05:23.160 George washingon cross during the\n00:05:24.440 Revolutionary War said the Rin River not\n00:05:27.039 that&#x27;s not true 33% of Americans when\n00:05:29.479 they asked who was the first treasury\n00:05:30.720 secretary didn&#x27;t know it was Alexander\n00:05:32.479 hamilt and they said it was Larry\n00:05:33.479 Summers so my theory is Americans don&#x27;t\n00:05:35.600 know enough about their history and you\n00:05:36.759 can be a better uh citizen if you know\n00:05:38.759 more about your history so I&#x27;m trying to\n00:05:39.960 buy these historic documents and put\n00:05:41.720 them on display make sure people know\n00:05:43.520 more about history as a way of\n00:05:44.880 introducing them to our history another\n00:05:46.840 thing happened by S tippity as well one\n00:05:48.639 time I was at the keny center and the\n00:05:50.919 man on the board was the head of the\n00:05:52.160 Park Service he told me that Washington\n00:05:53.520 Monument had suffered earthquake damage\n00:05:55.199 I told him I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll put\n00:05:56.639 up the money just ignore the government\n00:05:58.280 and the usual constraints forget\n00:05:59.680 Congress tell me how much it cost I&#x27;ll\n00:06:01.199 put up the money to fix it so he did he\n00:06:02.800 later came back and said Congress wanted\n00:06:04.039 to share the credit because they weren&#x27;t\n00:06:05.560 getting a lot of good credit so they\n00:06:06.560 said can they put up half the money I\n00:06:07.840 said okay so I just put up the money to\n00:06:10.199 repair the Washington Monument some of\n00:06:11.599 you may have seen the scaffolding there\n00:06:12.960 from time to time and then I came up\n00:06:14.520 with the idea that well that was a good\n00:06:15.960 idea but why not fix other historic\n00:06:17.800 things so I decided to help fix up\n00:06:20.000 monachello Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s home mon\n00:06:22.000 peer James Madison&#x27;s home Mount Vernon\n00:06:24.039 George Washington&#x27;s home the custus Lee\n00:06:25.840 Mansion at the top of Arlington and some\n00:06:27.639 other things that I&#x27;ll announce uh down\n00:06:29.120 the road and so what I&#x27;ve decided to do\n00:06:30.680 is to fix these historic buildings in\n00:06:33.000 part because I want to remind Americans\n00:06:34.319 of their history and try to do what I&#x27;m\n00:06:35.960 now called patriotic philanthropy which\n00\nThe file is too long and its contents have been

"update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To address your question on the differences between development and fundraising, and how development plans can positively contribute to fundraising, I draw from several of your sources:\n\n1. **Differences Between Development and Fundraising**:\n    - **Fundraising** is the process of gathering voluntary contributions of money or other resources, often through soliciting donations. It is typically event-driven or campaign-specific, focusing on immediate financial goals.\n    - **Development**, on the other hand, is broader and more strategic. It encompasses not only fundraising but also building and maintaining long-term relationships with donors, strategic planning for resource allocation, and often involves cultivating a culture of philanthropy within the organization and its community\u30108\u2020source\u3011.\n\n2. **How Development Plans Contribute to Fundraising**:\n    - Development plans are crucial as they lay out strategies not just for acquiring funds but for engaging and retaining donors over the long term. Effective development involves understanding donor motivations, aligning organizational goals with donor interests, and creating targeted, meaningful opportunities for donor involvement.\n    - These plans often lead to more sustainable fundraising as they help in building a loyal base of supporters who are invested in the mission of the organization. By focusing on relationship-building and strategic engagement, development can turn one-time donors into lifelong supporters\u30108\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn practice, an organization committed to cooperative models and equity might implement these concepts by:\n- **Engaging Community**: Involving community members not just as donors but as active participants in planning and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that fundraising and development activities are closely aligned with the community&#x27;s needs and values.\n- **Transparency and Accountability**: Clearly communicating how funds are used and demonstrating the impact of donations on the community. This transparency can build trust and deepen donor engagement.\n- **Diversifying Funding Sources**: By not relying solely on traditional forms of fundraising but exploring various forms of revenue generation such as social enterprises or membership programs that contribute to financial stability and mission alignment\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThese strategies not only enhance fundraising efforts but ensure that they contribute to the broader goal of creating a more equitable and happy society."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings. Consider the the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge,which raised money for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s\nDisease research.The initiative occasioned snickers and sniping from some professional\n\nphilanthropists, but donations it generated led to a major scientific breakthrough at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and pre-funding of clinical trials for new therapies.\n\nThere are many more examples. Crusades against autism by Bernie Marcus,against prostate cancer by\nMichael Milken, and against breast cancer by Nancy Brinker were all thought quixotic when they kicked\n\noff, yet each paid huge dividends. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute, and Markey fellowships would never have seen the light of day if many professionals\n\nhad had their way. And it was support from the Guggenheim family that allowed physicist Robert\nGoddard to overcome scorn from other scientists and ridicule by the New York Times to become the\n\ngenius of rocketry and father of America&#x27;s success in space.\n\nAmerica&#x27;s strong system of decentralized giving and homegrown problem-solving supports wide\n\nexperimentation and avoids putting all of our eggs in one national basket.\n\n5. Philanthropic aid lacks standardization! It&#x27;s a chaotic patchwork!\n\nThe lesson of the Internet is the accumulated power of millions of small actions. The story of today&#x27;s\n\nhacker culture is that one individual with a laptop can do astonishing things.Small-scale action that\nlacks uniformity should not be considered a failing.It&#x27;s not chaos,it&#x27;s crowdsourcing\u2014hordes of\neveryday people taking lots of small bites at a problem and eventually chewing through even very big\nissues.\n\nThere are rich examples of the power of dispersed decision-making throughout biology and across\nhuman history.

But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year. Measured against the $36o billion of cash that\nAmericans donate annually, and nearly that much more in the value of volunteered time,Gates\nFoundation commands less than I percent of our annual philanthropy. That is not an unhealthy\n\nconcentration of power.\n\nAmerican philanthropy is also diverse and diffuse. Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing.

However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations. Philanthropy has thus been crucial in allowing America to grow up as an exceedingly rare\nsociety where average people can steer their own lives without the state lurking over their shoulder.\n\nI2.

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power. But getting seduced by the\ngiantism of official aid is an egregious mistake. Small actions can and do converge into mighty rivers of\ncumulative effort.\n\n4. There are too many amateur efforts in philanthropy!\n\nIt&#x27;s easy to write off &quot;homemade&quot; solutions as amateurish, but grassroots efforts accomplish many great\nthings. Consider the the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge,which raised money for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s\nDisease research.The initiative occasioned snickers and sniping from some professional\n\nphilanthropists, but donations it generated led to a major scientific breakthrough at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and pre-funding of clinical trials for new therapies.\n\nThere are many more examples. Crusades against autism by Bernie Marcus,against prostate cancer by\nMichael Milken, and against breast cancer by Nancy Brinker were all thought quixotic when they kicked\n\noff, yet each paid huge dividends. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the Howard Hughes\nMedical Institute, and Markey fellowships would never have seen the light of day if many professionals\n\nhad had their way. And it was support from the Guggenheim family that allowed physicist Robert\nGoddard to overcome scorn from other scientists and ridicule by the New York Times to become the\n\ngenius of rocketry and father of America&#x27;s success in space.\n\nAmerica&#x27;s strong system of decentralized giving and homegrown problem-solving supports wide\n\nexperimentation and avoids putting all of our eggs in one national basket.\n\n5. Philanthropic aid lacks standardization! It&#x27;s a chaotic patchwork!\n\nThe lesson of the Internet is the accumulated power of millions of small actions. The story of today&#x27;s\n\nhacker culture is that one individual with a laptop can do astonishing things.Small-scale action that\nlacks uniformity should not be considered a failing.It&#x27;s not chaos,it&#x27;s crowdsourcing\u2014hordes of\neveryday people taking lots of small bites at a problem and eventually chewing through even very big\nissues.\n\nThere are rich examples of the power of dispersed decision-making throughout biology and across\nhuman history. Many of our most effective charities discovered the power of decentralization\ngenerations ago. Each of the I,4oo local chapters of Habitat for Humanity, for example,are independent\n\n3/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nentities with their own rules, practices, and funding.

However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations. Philanthropy has thus been crucial in allowing America to grow up as an exceedingly rare\nsociety where average people can steer their own lives without the state lurking over their shoulder.\n\nI2.

Porter and Mark R. Kramer\n\nFrom the Magazine (November-December 1999)\n\nDuring the past two decades,the number of charitable\nfoundations in the United States has doubled,while the value of\ntheir assets has increased more than 1,100%.Foundations now\nhold over $330 billion in assets and contribute over $20 billion\nannually to educational, humanitarian,and cultural\norganizations of all kinds. No other country in the world can\nclaim such substantial and widespread commitment to\nphilanthropy and volunteerism. But are we, as a society realizing\nthe full fruits of this commitment?\n\nGrant-giving foundations are intermediaries between the\nindividual donors who fund them and the various social\nenterprises that they, in turn, support. But if foundations serve\nonly as passive middlemen, as mere conduits for giving, then they\nfall far short of their potential and of society&#x27;s high expectations.\n\nFoundations can and should lead social progress. They have the\npotential to make more effective use of scarce resources than\neither individual donors or the government. Free from political\npressures,foundations can explore new solutions to social\nproblems with an independence tha t government can never have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations Create Value in  Four Ways\n\nOne grant\nX\n\nMultiple grants\n3X-5X\n\nEntire operating budget of one organization\n\n50X-100X\n\nEntire field\n\n&gt;1,000X\n\nmillionsDollar value of resources affected by foundation activity\n\nEach successive approach leverages a foundation&#x27;s\n\nspecial assets more than the preceding one as the pool\no f  \u22ef\n\nV\n\n1. Selecting the Best Grantees.\n\nThe process of value creation here is straightforward. Like\ninvestment advisers in the business world,foundations can use\ntheir expertise to channel resources to their most productive uses\nwithin the social sector by funding organizations that are the\nmost cost effective or that address urgent or overlooked problems.\nFor example,of the many organizations that seek funding for\nprograms aimed at reducing the high school dropout rate, a\nfoundation can select the most effective one.Thus its dollar will\n\nearn a higher social return than a dollar given less knowledgeably\nby an individual donor. In this way, choosing recipients and\nallocating funds is itself a source of value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpertise to benefit from the increased tourism. The Packard\nFoundation&#x27;s grant paid for marketing consultants who taught\nCEDO how to turn  tourists  into members, creating an ongoing\nrevenue stream for CEDO far greater than the Foundation&#x27;s\n$50,000 grant.\n\nThe Echoing Green Foundation, created by venture capitalist Ed\nCohen,gives $1.4 million a year to improve the performance of the\nnonprofit sector even more broadly. It invests in social\nentrepreneurs, individuals with the drive and vision to catalyze\nsocial change. It aims to build a community of public-service\nleaders who share their experience, knowledge, and energy with\none another. To date, Echoing Green has funded more than 300\nfellows who not only pursue their own projects but also visit with\none another to share best practices. The lessons learned are\nrecorded, distributed to all grantees,and made publicly available.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, for example, the Charles and Helen Schwab\nFamily Foundation in San Mateo, California, joined with the\nPeninsula Community Foundation and the Sobrato Foundation in\na $2 million,two-year initiative to address internal issues of\nmanagement and growth at 16 local family-service agencies.\nEvery eight weeks for the life of the project, foundation staff\nmembers meet with all 16 agency directors. Management experts\nare brought in to address relevant topics. As a result of the group\ndiscussions, three of the grantees have decided that they ca\n\nThe range of ways in which foundations can assist nonprofits goes\nwell beyond making management-development grants.\nFoundations can become fully engaged partners, providing\nadvice, management assistance,access to professional service\nfirms, clout, and a host of other non-cash resources. Improving\nthe  performance of grant recipients often requires foundations to\nwork closely with grantees. It also requires the willingness to\nengage for the long term. Foundations are capable of both.\n\nn\n\n\n\noperate more efficiently if they merge,and foundation staff has\nworked closely with them to accomplish the merger. Because\ntechnology management has surfaced as a major issue, the\nfoundations have researched and funded technology needs at\nseveral of the agencies.\n\n4 .  Advancing the State of Knowledge and Practice.\n\nFoundations can create the greatest value by funding research\nand a systematic progression of projects that produce more\neffective ways to address social problems.At its best, such work\nresults in a new framework that shapes subsequent work in the\nfield-making every dollar spent by philanthropists, government,\nand other organizations more productive.\n\nWithin six years,India doubled its rice production, and Mexico,\nonce an importer of wheat, became an exporter. Nigeria and\nColombia created  their  own research institutes  modeled  on  the\nfoundations&#x27; research.  The Rockefeller Foundation subsequently\ndisseminated its results to organizations from 28 developing\ncountries. Altogether, many millions of the world&#x27;s poorest people\nbenefited from the knowledge created by those two foundations\n\nFoundations are uniquely positioned to study a field in depth.\nThey can set a new agenda and change both public sentiment and\ngovernment policy. The green revolution, for example, had its\nroots in research sponsored jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller\nFoundations in the late 1950s and early 1960s.Concerned with\nworld hunger and population growth, the two foundations\ncreated research institutes that developed new strains of wheat\nand rice tha t doubled and tripled crop output per acre.\n\n.\n\nStudies by the Carnegie Foundation have had a similarly powerful\nimpact on education in the United States over the last 95 years. In\n1904,Carnegie funded research by Abraham Flexner on the state\nof medical education, which revealed a widespread lack of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the field of education, the Philanthropic Ventures Foundation\nin Oakland, California, for example, focuses on grassroots\nfunding. In 1995, PVF created the Teacher Resource Grants\nprogram. Working within the large field of education, PVF chose a\nspecialized positioning appropriate to its small size. PVF provides\ninexpensive but badly needed classroom materials to teachers in\nits region\u2014materials that are useless if they don&#x27;t arrive quickly,\nwhen the teacher needs them.\n\nPVF notified more than 6,000 teachers that grants of up to $1,500\nwould be available for classroom materials,field trip s, or teacher\ntraining courses.(After a year of experience, PVF lowered the\nceiling to $500 per grant.) Teachers refer to the program as the\n\u201cfax-grant program\u201d because the foundation takes requests by fax,\nand then sends an answer within one hour of receipt and a check\nwithin 24 hours.\n\nSince its positioning is to help under-resourced teachers and it\nmakes thousands of small grants, the Philanthropic Ventures\nFoundation developed a no-paperwork rule, freeing teachers from\ntime-consuming grant applications.PVF finds that an elaborate\nprocess around  the receipt, investigation, consideration, and\n\nfunding of grant requests is not necessary in its chosen area.\n\nPVF is a perfect example of a foundation that tailored its activities\nto create value. Only by doing things differently from others, in a\nway that is linked tightly to what the foundation seeks to\naccomplish, can it achieve greater impact with the same grant\ndollars or enable its grantees to be more successful. Tailoring\nactivities to strategy is the way a foundation institutionalizes and\nreinforces its distinctive strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\ntyranny of the grant cycle, with barely the time to write up\npending grant requests between board meetings.

Fewer than 9% of foundations\n\n\n\nmake 75% or more of their grants in a single field, and only 5%\nfocus more than  90% of their grants in one field. Such scattered\ngiving is inconsistent with a clear strategic positioning.\n\nNor do the data suggest that many foundations are taking\nadvantage of their unique ways to create value. Among the largest\nfoundations,with assets in excess of $1 billion,each professional\nemployee handles approximately seven grants per year (and up to\n100 times as many grant requests). There are, on average, just\nthree professional employees for every field in which the\nfoundation makes grants. Staff at the largest foundations may\nwell have sufficient time and expertise to evaluate grants,but it is\nhard to see how even the most dedicated staff could have much\ntime to assist grantees.  The smaller the foundation, the more\nstretched the staff. Among the hundreds of foundations with $50\nmillion to $250 million in assets, there are five times as many\ngrants per professional,and an average of two staff members\nhandle grants in 11 unrelated fields. The smallest foundations\noften rely on the volunteer efforts of trustees, making it almost\ncertain that many decisions are reached with little formal\nevaluation at all.\n\nThose broad metrics also suggest that foundations are not using\nthe more powerful forms of value creation beyond selection.\nFoundations rarely contribute resources other than financial\nsupport. Only 2.2% of foundation grants were designated to\nimprove the grantees&#x27; performance.Ninety-five percent of all\nfoundation grants are for one year.Although one-year grants are\nsometimes awarded for several years in a row, there is little\nevidence that foundations exploit the opportunity to work more\nclosely with grantees over extended periods of time to improve\ntheir performance. Foundations, which should be able to take the\nlong view tend to focus on grant making quarter-to-quarter.\n\n\n\nFinally, while foundations express a strong interest in innovation\nand advancing the state of knowledge about society&#x27;s problems,\nvery few fund studies that  explore the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent approaches to a given problem. Only 8.8% of foundation\ngrants went to research,and most of that was in basic medical and\nscientific areas. Funding studies or data collection is rare, and\nfoundations generally see them as less desirable than current\nsocial services.\n\nInstead of funding research, many foundations seek to promote\ninnovation through seed grants that are designed to establish and\nsupport specific new programs.There is little benefit, however, in\nstarting new initiatives if they do not survive and grow. Too often\nfoundations overlook projects aimed at fostering the growth and\nreplication of new initiatives, or they fail to support the grantee\nover an appropriately long time span. They rarely do the up-front\nresearch and the postevaluation needed to ascertain if their\nprograms have been successful and have continued to thrive after\nthe initial period of seed grant support.\n\nIn some ways, however, the overall failure to evaluate the results\nof foundation grants is the most telling danger sign of all.Almost\nno money is set aside for program evaluation.Many foundations\nare ambivalent about whether funds should be spent on\nevaluation and whether assessing the performance of past grants\ncan improve future grant making. This ambivalence about\nevaluation is reinforced by the performance criteria used to judge\nfoundation staff. These tend to emphasize the paper trail of\npregrant analysis and recommendations and give little credit for\nachieving the real-world results that motivated the grant in the\nfirst place.Program evaluation,therefore, has only a downside:\nfailure risks censure, but success adds no reward.\n\n\n\nThe evaluations that do take place are often problematic in three\nways. First, they are limited to reports as to whether the money\nwas spent as intended (output evaluation);they do not attempt to\nmeasure social impact (outcome evaluation). Second,many of the\nevaluations are done by the grant recipients themselves, who\ninvariably seek further support from the foundation.How\nobjective and reliable are these reports likely to be? Third,even in\nthe few cases where the social impact of a program is measured by\nan outside consultant, it is usually assessed at the single grantee\nlevel,in isolation from the foundation&#x27;s other grants.Therefore, it\ndoes not reflect the foundation&#x27;s success in reaching its overall\ngoals.\n\nCertainly, evaluation may at times be costly and complex.But\ngiven clear goals at the outset, it is always possible. The criteria to\nevaluate a job-training program will differ from those used to\nevaluate a funding program for young artists. But meaningful\ncriteria can be established for both.\n\nConsider the San Francisco-based Roberts Enterprise\nDevelopment Fund,which focuses on creating employment for\nthe homeless and indigent. Working closely with its grantee\nRubicon Programs, REDF developed 25 criteria that not only\nmeasure the success of job-training programs but also help\nRubicon to manage the programs more effectively. In addition to\nthe most obvious criteria\u2014changes in employment stability\nwages,and job skills\u2014REDF and Rubicon found that related\nfactors such as substance abuse and even qualitative factors such\nas the trainees&#x27; own assessments of their success in reaching\npersonal goals were all meaningful measures of outcomes the\nprogram was trying to achieve.\n\nWithout evaluation, a foundation will never know whether or not\nit has been successful. The most basic premise of strategy-\nstriving for superior performance\u2014is violated if performance is\n\n\n\nnot measured.\n\nAddressing the New Agenda\n\nHow can foundations begin down the path we have outlined? A\nnumber of foundations, including those operating under the new\nrubric of venture philanthropy, are already moving in the\ndirection outlined here. But none that we have encountered has\ngone all the way. Putting these elements together into a coherent\nwhole will require developing a strategy, aligning operations with\nthat strategy, and revising the foundation&#x27;s governance so that the\nstrategy can be monitored effectively. Responsibility for such\nchange lies ultimately with the trustees and directors, who are the\nfiduciaries accountable for the use of the foundation&#x27;s (and\nsociety&#x27;s) funds.\n\nTo develop a strategy  the place to start is positioning. This always\nrequires systematic thought and research into important social\nchallenges that are not being addressed well by others. The goal is\nnot necessarily to identify the most important problem,since\nmany are important.W hat matters is how effectively the\nfou nd at ion  can  co n trib u te  to  its  so lu tion .\n\nSecond, a foundation can learn from prior efforts within its\nchosen area of funding. Do current socioeconomic trends favor\none approach over another? What are other organizations doing\nin  th e  fie ld? Can the  work  of th is  foun da tion  re in fo rce  o r\n\ncomplement theirs? Can we uncover root causes of the problem?\n\nThird,what unique strengths will enable this foundation to create\nvalue most effectively in its field? Part of the answer to this\nquestion comes from examining objectively where the foundation\nhas made the greatest impact in the past. It also comes from a\nre alist ic  assessm e n t  o f w eakne sses.\n\n\n\nScale plays an important role in the choice of strategy. A\nfoundation  needs enough  resources to pursue its particular way of\n\ncreating value.Larger foundations may well have the scale to\nwork in more than one field. If they choose to do so, each area\nmust have its own strategy and tailored operations. All\nfoundations, however, can create more value by putting a greater\nproportion of their resources to work.  This means stepping up the\nrate of giving in their chosen fields and investing a portion of\ntheir  investm ent portfolios to support their  philanthropic work.\n\nOnce the foundation has chosen a strategy, it can begin to realign\nits operations.  A foundation, like any enterprise, is a collection of\nmany activities. Each activity-how  proposals are solicited, for\nexample, and how grantees are supported\u2014must be tailored to\nthe chosen strategy  A particularly important aspect of\noperational alignment is the development of measures to help the\nfoundation know whether or not it has been successful.\n\nOperating strategically will require most foundations to rethink\ntheir governance systems. Change will be difficult in an\nenvironment where the pressure of processing grants and getting\nthe money out the door extends beyond the  staff to the\nboardroom. Today boards of all bu t the very  largest foundations\ndiscuss and approve specific grant allocations at th eir meetings.\nWithout goals or strategy, they have no way to delegate the grant\nselection process to staff and no framework through which to\nevaluate their experience.The Chicago-based Crown Foundation,\nin an effort to break this cycle, considers grant requests at only\ntwo of its quarterly board meetings each year; the other two are\nreserved for discussing policy, reviewing performance, and\nstudying issues in more depth. Boards need to move away from\nthe operating function of approving grants to focus on setting\nstrategy and evaluating outcomes.\n\n\n\nWith goals, a strategy, and evaluation mechanisms in place,staff\ncould have greater independence to make grant decisions\nthemselves on a more timely and flexible basis. At the Colorado\nTrust,the board considers and approves multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar initiatives that have clearly defined goals and a clearly\narticulated strategy  Once the board sets the  framework, program\nstaff has the authority to make individual grants for the life of the\ninitiative. Staff members, then, have greater responsibility and\nmore freedom to make decisions on individual grants, and the\nboard  has the tim e to study  the field, set overall strategies, and\nassess staff performance.\n\nFor those who care deeply about social problems and work\ntirelessly to make a difference, current foundation practices not\nonly diminish effectiveness,they inevitably reduce the\nsatisfaction that donors, staff, and trustees derive from their\nwork. Scattered funding, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with\ngrantees, and a lack of awareness of outcomes necessarily create a\ndivide between the foundation and the ultimate results of its\nwork.Acting strategically is much more difficult. But for trustees\nand staff alike, it will be far more rewarding as well.\n\nImproving the performance of philanthropy would enable\nfoundations to have a much greater impact on society.\nFoundations could play a leading role in changing the culture of\nsocial sector management.They could spearhead the evolution of\nphilanthropy from private acts of conscience into a professional\nfield. Until foundations accept their accountability to society and\nmeet their obligation to create value, they exist in a world where\nthey cannot fail.Unfortunately, they also cannot truly succeed.\nA version of this article appeared in the November-December 1999 issue of\nHarvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nMichael E.

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3.

But it&#x27;s important to note how radically\ndecentralized US giving is. Only I4 percent of total giving today comes from foundations started by the\nwealthy. The vast majority of annual donations come from individuals, dominated by everyday donors\nwho give at a rate of about $2,5oo per household. The very largest single giver in the United States\u2014the\nGates Foundation\u2014grants out about $4 billion per year. Measured against the $36o billion of cash that\nAmericans donate annually, and nearly that much more in the value of volunteered time,Gates\nFoundation commands less than I percent of our annual philanthropy. That is not an unhealthy\n\nconcentration of power.\n\nAmerican philanthropy is also diverse and diffuse. Its millions of givers and hundreds of thousands of\ncharitable organizations compose a kind of huge matrix of private legislatures that define social ills, set\n\ngoals and priorities, and methodically marshal resources to attack problems near at hand\u2014without\nasking the state&#x27;s permission. Admirers of participatory democracy ought to be excited by these mass\n\nactions. As Yale law professor Stephen Carter points out, individuals who give to charity often &quot;measure\n\nthe needs of the community by different calipers than centralized policy makers, and will therefore\ncontribute to a different set of  causes. These millions of individual decisions lead to a diversity in\n\nspending that would be impossible if we adopted the theory that the only money spent for the public\n\ngood is the money spent by the state.&quot; For this reason Carter refers to philanthropy as \u201cdemocracy in\naction.\u201d\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville said in Democracy in America that what impressed him about America&#x27;s voluntary\nactivity was not just the practical problems it solved, but the way the country&#x27;s hyperactive giving and\n\nvolunteering builds up the social muscles needed for a people to be self-governing.

According to the UCLA Civil Rights Project, America&#x27;s most\n\nsegregated and often most inadequate government-run schools are all in northern cities with activist\n\ngovernments: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark, Chicago, and Philadelphia. In fact,the country&#x27;s\n\nmost segregated schools are in New York state, thanks to New York City, where the proportion of\n\nschools in which at least go percent of the students are black or Hispanic rose sharply from 1989 to\n2OIO.\n\nIt is private philanthropy that is shaking up New York City&#x27;s complacent educational establishment\ntoday by launching charter schools. There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J. Paul Getty, Leland Stanford,\nRussell Sage, and John MacArthur were known to exhibit shabby behavior. (Stanford, for example,\n\nemployed stock watering, kickbacks,bribery, and collusion.) Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints. Adam Smith taught us that\nfreely conducted commerce can take normal human behaviors\u2014including ugly and mercenary on es -\nand turn them to broadly productive uses.The same is true in the world of philanthropy.Part of the\nmagic of America&#x27;s charitable structure is that it can convert common human impulses into truth,\nuplift, and beauty for all of society.\n\nIo . Philanthropy distracts people who ought to focus on business!\n\nThe right side of the political spectrum sometimes complains that philanthropy drags too many\nproductive business people into do-gooding,distracting them from creating the commercial bounty that\n\n6/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nsociety counts on. But there are reasons to think that philanthropy actually strengthens capitalism.\n\nEconomists Zoltan Acs and Ronnie Phillips have observed that the United States has a distinctive\n\nmeans of \u201creconstituting\u201d wealth via philanthropy.\u201cPhilanthropy is part of the implicit social contract\nthat continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity,&quot; they write. Researchers Tino and Nima\nSanandaji agree that the \u201clegitimacy of American capitalism has in part been upheld through voluntary\ndonations.&quot; They note that &quot;much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to society.\n\nThis has had several feedback effects on capitalism. For one, the practice has limited the rise of new\ndynasties. Another positive feedback mechanism is that the donations to research and higher education\nhave allowed new generations to become wealthy?\n\nII. Philanthropy encourages collective thinking, collective responsibility, and collective action\u2014\nultimately leading to more government!\n\nThis is another concern sometimes launched from the libertarian right, where observers argue that\n\nwhat American society really needs is more individual responsibility, not more giveaways. However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations. Philanthropy has thus been crucial in allowing America to grow up as an exceedingly rare\nsociety where average people can steer their own lives without the state lurking over their shoulder.\n\nI2. Donating money is sometimes too much about the giver&#x27;s needs!\n\nGiving is a two-way transaction,and the satisfactions of helping are just as real and just as good for\nhuman flourishing as the satisfactions of having someone come to your aid. That&#x27;s why even people\n\n7/8https://ssir.org/articles/entry/12_common_crticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nwith little disposable income are eager to give,and feel good when they do.\n\nSocial science research supports th is.In  a 20o8 paper, three investigators gave study participants\nmoney, and then asked half of them to spend it on themselves, and the other half to give it to some\n\nperson or charity.

During these\n\nsessions I&#x27;ve collected I2 broad criticisms of charitable action that people sometimes raise. From the\nlessons of my Almanac research,I offer responses below.\n\nI. Charitable aid should focus on the poor; too much giving today goes to other causes!\n\nThis increasingly common argument is supported by the so-called &quot;effective altruism&quot; movement,\nwhich complains that a dollar spent on a university or park or music school could instead have headed\noff a dire problem such as, say, river blindness for an impoverished African.\n\nThe most specious part of this criticism is the suggestion that donors can&#x27;t do both things.\nPhilanthropists are currently producing good results across a vast spectrum of causes, including many\nefforts to help the poor. In fact, the fastest-growing sector of US private philanthropy in recent years has\n\nbeen overseas aid to poor people. Indeed,the poor in foreign countries now get more help from US\n\ndonors ($39 billion per year) than from official US government aid ($3i billion).\n\nAre you enjoying this article?

Yes,places like MIT and Johns Hopkins are wealthy institutions, but\nvoluntary gifts to them ultimately result in things like portable x-ray machines,new vaccines,and\n\ninexpensive cell phones that are valuable to all people, especially the poor\n\nPart of what makes philanthropy powerful and beautiful is its riotous variety. Allowing donors to follow\ntheir passions has proven, over generations, to be an effective way of inspiring powerful commitments\n\nand getting big results. Cramped definitions of philanthropy that limit donors to approved areas would\nsuffocate many valuable social inventions.\n\n2. Charity is an artifact no longer necessary in a modern welfare state!\n\nSome view private giving and problem-solving as vestiges of simpler times, with which we can now\n\ndispense.  The public,however, disagrees. In a nationally representative survey of likely US voters in\n20I5, respondents chose philanthropy over government as their &quot;first choice for solving a social problem\nin America\u201d\u2014by 47 percent to 32 percent. Asked whether they most trusted entrepreneurial companies,\nnonprofit charities, or government agencies,43 percent of respondents chose charities, 28 percent\nselected entrepreneurial companies, and just I4 percent chose government agencies.\n\nPhilanthropy solves problems differently than government. It tends to be more inventive and\nexperimental, quicker, nimbler, more efficient, more varied, more personalized,more interested in\ntransformation than treatment, and more efficient. The public sees this and values it.\n\n3. Charitable donations are just a drop in the bucket!\n\nAmerica&#x27;s nonprofit sector now commands I percent of our workforce and 6 percent of GDP\u2014not\n\nincluding volunteer time, which,if we attached a reasonable hourly wage to it, nearly equals the $36o\nbillion we donate in cash every year.\n\nThe Gates Foundation alone now  distributes more overseas assistance than  the  entire  Italian\n\ngovernment. It is estimated that in just its first two decades, its overseas vaccine program alone will save\n\nthe lives of 8 million preschool children. Then consider that members of US churches and synagogues\n\n\u2014just one division of America&#x27;s larger philanthropic army\u2014send four and a half times as much money\noverseas to poor people every year as the Gates Foundation does!\n\n2/8https://ssirorg/articles/entry/12_common_criticisms_of_philanthropyand_some_answers#\n\n\n\n5/24/24,1:05 AM 12 Common Criticisms of Philanthropy\u2014and Some Answers\n\nThe fact that most philanthropy takes place out of the public eye\u2014in small doses, and often in private or\n\neven anonymous ways\u2014makes it easy to overlook its size and power.

There are currently 95,ooo New York City children in charters,\nnearly all of them minorities and low-income, and another 42,6oo on waiting lists. Stanford researchers\nand other investigators find that these children are receiving significantly better educations than\ncounterparts in conventional government-run schools,in some cases even outscoring comfortable\nsuburban schools in annual testing.\n\n9. Some donors are mean,vainly seek their name on things, or take part in charity for all the wrong\nreasons!\n\nIt&#x27;s true that philanthropists aren&#x27;t always pretty. Prominent donors like J. Paul Getty, Leland Stanford,\nRussell Sage, and John MacArthur were known to exhibit shabby behavior. (Stanford, for example,\n\nemployed stock watering, kickbacks,bribery, and collusion.) Nonetheless, each ultimately managed to\nbe very helpful to others.\n\nThe genius of the philanthropic mechanism is that it accepts people just as they are\u2014kind impulses,\nselfish impulses,confusions and vanities,wishes of all sorts swirling together in the usual human\njumble\u2014and helps them do wondrous things,even when they&#x27;re not saints. Adam Smith taught us that\nfreely conducted commerce can take normal human behaviors\u2014including ugly and mercenary on es -\nand turn them to broadly productive uses.The same is true in the world of philanthropy.Part of the\nmagic of America&#x27;s charitable structure is that it can convert common human impulses into truth,\nuplift, and beauty for all of society.\n\nIo .

But there are reasons to think that philanthropy actually strengthens capitalism.\n\nEconomists Zoltan Acs and Ronnie Phillips have observed that the United States has a distinctive\n\nmeans of \u201creconstituting\u201d wealth via philanthropy.\u201cPhilanthropy is part of the implicit social contract\nthat continuously nurtures and revitalizes economic prosperity,&quot; they write. Researchers Tino and Nima\nSanandaji agree that the \u201clegitimacy of American capitalism has in part been upheld through voluntary\ndonations.&quot; They note that &quot;much of the new wealth created historically has been given back to society.\n\nThis has had several feedback effects on capitalism. For one, the practice has limited the rise of new\ndynasties. Another positive feedback mechanism is that the donations to research and higher education\nhave allowed new generations to become wealthy?\n\nII. Philanthropy encourages collective thinking, collective responsibility, and collective action\u2014\nultimately leading to more government!\n\nThis is another concern sometimes launched from the libertarian right, where observers argue that\n\nwhat American society really needs is more individual responsibility, not more giveaways. However, we\ncan just as plausibly turn that argument around, because there is evidence that philanthropy helps limit\n\ngovernment sprawl\n\nWhen some members of a society become needy, it is a fact that many citizens will insist,&quot;Something\n\nmust be done!&quot; Most times and places,the responsibility for picking up those in trouble has fallen to the\nstate. America&#x27;s energetic voluntary sector, however,allows Americans to meet humanitarian and Judeo-\n\nChristian responsibilities to their fellow humans without setting up large government apparatuses and\n\nregimenting rules that suffocate individual sovereignty\n\nBy solving basic security hungers and stretching multiple safety nets among the general populace,\n\nphilanthropy has made Americans much more tolerant of the creative destruction that&#x27;s part of  a\ndynamic economy, leaving us with a freer and faster-growing economy than comparable industrial\n\nnations. Philanthropy has thus been crucial in allowing America to grow up as an exceedingly rare\nsociety where average people can steer their own lives without the state lurking over their shoulder.\n\nI2.

Porter and Mark R. Kramer\n\nFrom the Magazine (November-December 1999)\n\nDuring the past two decades,the number of charitable\nfoundations in the United States has doubled,while the value of\ntheir assets has increased more than 1,100%.Foundations now\nhold over $330 billion in assets and contribute over $20 billion\nannually to educational, humanitarian,and cultural\norganizations of all kinds. No other country in the world can\nclaim such substantial and widespread commitment to\nphilanthropy and volunteerism. But are we, as a society realizing\nthe full fruits of this commitment?\n\nGrant-giving foundations are intermediaries between the\nindividual donors who fund them and the various social\nenterprises that they, in turn, support. But if foundations serve\nonly as passive middlemen, as mere conduits for giving, then they\nfall far short of their potential and of society&#x27;s high expectations.\n\nFoundations can and should lead social progress. They have the\npotential to make more effective use of scarce resources than\neither individual donors or the government. Free from political\npressures,foundations can explore new solutions to social\nproblems with an independence tha t government can never have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations Create Value in  Four Ways\n\nOne grant\nX\n\nMultiple grants\n3X-5X\n\nEntire operating budget of one organization\n\n50X-100X\n\nEntire field\n\n&gt;1,000X\n\nmillionsDollar value of resources affected by foundation activity\n\nEach successive approach leverages a foundation&#x27;s\n\nspecial assets more than the preceding one as the pool\no f  \u22ef\n\nV\n\n1. Selecting the Best Grantees.\n\nThe process of value creation here is straightforward. Like\ninvestment advisers in the business world,foundations can use\ntheir expertise to channel resources to their most productive uses\nwithin the social sector by funding organizations that are the\nmost cost effective or that address urgent or overlooked problems.\nFor example,of the many organizations that seek funding for\nprograms aimed at reducing the high school dropout rate, a\nfoundation can select the most effective one.Thus its dollar will\n\nearn a higher social return than a dollar given less knowledgeably\nby an individual donor. In this way, choosing recipients and\nallocating funds is itself a source of value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpertise to benefit from the increased tourism. The Packard\nFoundation&#x27;s grant paid for marketing consultants who taught\nCEDO how to turn  tourists  into members, creating an ongoing\nrevenue stream for CEDO far greater than the Foundation&#x27;s\n$50,000 grant.\n\nThe Echoing Green Foundation, created by venture capitalist Ed\nCohen,gives $1.4 million a year to improve the performance of the\nnonprofit sector even more broadly. It invests in social\nentrepreneurs, individuals with the drive and vision to catalyze\nsocial change. It aims to build a community of public-service\nleaders who share their experience, knowledge, and energy with\none another. To date, Echoing Green has funded more than 300\nfellows who not only pursue their own projects but also visit with\none another to share best practices. The lessons learned are\nrecorded, distributed to all grantees,and made publicly available.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, for example, the Charles and Helen Schwab\nFamily Foundation in San Mateo, California, joined with the\nPeninsula Community Foundation and the Sobrato Foundation in\na $2 million,two-year initiative to address internal issues of\nmanagement and growth at 16 local family-service agencies.\nEvery eight weeks for the life of the project, foundation staff\nmembers meet with all 16 agency directors. Management experts\nare brought in to address relevant topics. As a result of the group\ndiscussions, three of the grantees have decided that they ca\n\nThe range of ways in which foundations can assist nonprofits goes\nwell beyond making management-development grants.\nFoundations can become fully engaged partners, providing\nadvice, management assistance,access to professional service\nfirms, clout, and a host of other non-cash resources. Improving\nthe  performance of grant recipients often requires foundations to\nwork closely with grantees. It also requires the willingness to\nengage for the long term. Foundations are capable of both.\n\nn\n\n\n\noperate more efficiently if they merge,and foundation staff has\nworked closely with them to accomplish the merger. Because\ntechnology management has surfaced as a major issue, the\nfoundations have researched and funded technology needs at\nseveral of the agencies.\n\n4 .  Advancing the State of Knowledge and Practice.\n\nFoundations can create the greatest value by funding research\nand a systematic progression of projects that produce more\neffective ways to address social problems.At its best, such work\nresults in a new framework that shapes subsequent work in the\nfield-making every dollar spent by philanthropists, government,\nand other organizations more productive.\n\nWithin six years,India doubled its rice production, and Mexico,\nonce an importer of wheat, became an exporter. Nigeria and\nColombia created  their  own research institutes  modeled  on  the\nfoundations&#x27; research.  The Rockefeller Foundation subsequently\ndisseminated its results to organizations from 28 developing\ncountries. Altogether, many millions of the world&#x27;s poorest people\nbenefited from the knowledge created by those two foundations\n\nFoundations are uniquely positioned to study a field in depth.\nThey can set a new agenda and change both public sentiment and\ngovernment policy. The green revolution, for example, had its\nroots in research sponsored jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller\nFoundations in the late 1950s and early 1960s.Concerned with\nworld hunger and population growth, the two foundations\ncreated research institutes that developed new strains of wheat\nand rice tha t doubled and tripled crop output per acre.\n\n.\n\nStudies by the Carnegie Foundation have had a similarly powerful\nimpact on education in the United States over the last 95 years. In\n1904,Carnegie funded research by Abraham Flexner on the state\nof medical education, which revealed a widespread lack of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the field of education, the Philanthropic Ventures Foundation\nin Oakland, California, for example, focuses on grassroots\nfunding. In 1995, PVF created the Teacher Resource Grants\nprogram. Working within the large field of education, PVF chose a\nspecialized positioning appropriate to its small size. PVF provides\ninexpensive but badly needed classroom materials to teachers in\nits region\u2014materials that are useless if they don&#x27;t arrive quickly,\nwhen the teacher needs them.\n\nPVF notified more than 6,000 teachers that grants of up to $1,500\nwould be available for classroom materials,field trip s, or teacher\ntraining courses.(After a year of experience, PVF lowered the\nceiling to $500 per grant.) Teachers refer to the program as the\n\u201cfax-grant program\u201d because the foundation takes requests by fax,\nand then sends an answer within one hour of receipt and a check\nwithin 24 hours.\n\nSince its positioning is to help under-resourced teachers and it\nmakes thousands of small grants, the Philanthropic Ventures\nFoundation developed a no-paperwork rule, freeing teachers from\ntime-consuming grant applications.PVF finds that an elaborate\nprocess around  the receipt, investigation, consideration, and\n\nfunding of grant requests is not necessary in its chosen area.\n\nPVF is a perfect example of a foundation that tailored its activities\nto create value. Only by doing things differently from others, in a\nway that is linked tightly to what the foundation seeks to\naccomplish, can it achieve greater impact with the same grant\ndollars or enable its grantees to be more successful. Tailoring\nactivities to strategy is the way a foundation institutionalizes and\nreinforces its distinctive strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\ntyranny of the grant cycle, with barely the time to write up\npending grant requests between board meetings.

Fewer than 9% of foundations\n\n\n\nmake 75% or more of their grants in a single field, and only 5%\nfocus more than  90% of their grants in one field. Such scattered\ngiving is inconsistent with a clear strategic positioning.\n\nNor do the data suggest that many foundations are taking\nadvantage of their unique ways to create value. Among the largest\nfoundations,with assets in excess of $1 billion,each professional\nemployee handles approximately seven grants per year (and up to\n100 times as many grant requests). There are, on average, just\nthree professional employees for every field in which the\nfoundation makes grants. Staff at the largest foundations may\nwell have sufficient time and expertise to evaluate grants,but it is\nhard to see how even the most dedicated staff could have much\ntime to assist grantees.  The smaller the foundation, the more\nstretched the staff. Among the hundreds of foundations with $50\nmillion to $250 million in assets, there are five times as many\ngrants per professional,and an average of two staff members\nhandle grants in 11 unrelated fields. The smallest foundations\noften rely on the volunteer efforts of trustees, making it almost\ncertain that many decisions are reached with little formal\nevaluation at all.\n\nThose broad metrics also suggest that foundations are not using\nthe more powerful forms of value creation beyond selection.\nFoundations rarely contribute resources other than financial\nsupport. Only 2.2% of foundation grants were designated to\nimprove the grantees&#x27; performance.Ninety-five percent of all\nfoundation grants are for one year.Although one-year grants are\nsometimes awarded for several years in a row, there is little\nevidence that foundations exploit the opportunity to work more\nclosely with grantees over extended periods of time to improve\ntheir performance. Foundations, which should be able to take the\nlong view tend to focus on grant making quarter-to-quarter.\n\n\n\nFinally, while foundations express a strong interest in innovation\nand advancing the state of knowledge about society&#x27;s problems,\nvery few fund studies that  explore the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent approaches to a given problem. Only 8.8% of foundation\ngrants went to research,and most of that was in basic medical and\nscientific areas. Funding studies or data collection is rare, and\nfoundations generally see them as less desirable than current\nsocial services.\n\nInstead of funding research, many foundations seek to promote\ninnovation through seed grants that are designed to establish and\nsupport specific new programs.There is little benefit, however, in\nstarting new initiatives if they do not survive and grow. Too often\nfoundations overlook projects aimed at fostering the growth and\nreplication of new initiatives, or they fail to support the grantee\nover an appropriately long time span. They rarely do the up-front\nresearch and the postevaluation needed to ascertain if their\nprograms have been successful and have continued to thrive after\nthe initial period of seed grant support.\n\nIn some ways, however, the overall failure to evaluate the results\nof foundation grants is the most telling danger sign of all.Almost\nno money is set aside for program evaluation.Many foundations\nare ambivalent about whether funds should be spent on\nevaluation and whether assessing the performance of past grants\ncan improve future grant making. This ambivalence about\nevaluation is reinforced by the performance criteria used to judge\nfoundation staff. These tend to emphasize the paper trail of\npregrant analysis and recommendations and give little credit for\nachieving the real-world results that motivated the grant in the\nfirst place.Program evaluation,therefore, has only a downside:\nfailure risks censure, but success adds no reward.\n\n\n\nThe evaluations that do take place are often problematic in three\nways. First, they are limited to reports as to whether the money\nwas spent as intended (output evaluation);they do not attempt to\nmeasure social impact (outcome evaluation). Second,many of the\nevaluations are done by the grant recipients themselves, who\ninvariably seek further support from the foundation.How\nobjective and reliable are these reports likely to be? Third,even in\nthe few cases where the social impact of a program is measured by\nan outside consultant, it is usually assessed at the single grantee\nlevel,in isolation from the foundation&#x27;s other grants.Therefore, it\ndoes not reflect the foundation&#x27;s success in reaching its overall\ngoals.\n\nCertainly, evaluation may at times be costly and complex.But\ngiven clear goals at the outset, it is always possible. The criteria to\nevaluate a job-training program will differ from those used to\nevaluate a funding program for young artists. But meaningful\ncriteria can be established for both.\n\nConsider the San Francisco-based Roberts Enterprise\nDevelopment Fund,which focuses on creating employment for\nthe homeless and indigent. Working closely with its grantee\nRubicon Programs, REDF developed 25 criteria that not only\nmeasure the success of job-training programs but also help\nRubicon to manage the programs more effectively. In addition to\nthe most obvious criteria\u2014changes in employment stability\nwages,and job skills\u2014REDF and Rubicon found that related\nfactors such as substance abuse and even qualitative factors such\nas the trainees&#x27; own assessments of their success in reaching\npersonal goals were all meaningful measures of outcomes the\nprogram was trying to achieve.\n\nWithout evaluation, a foundation will never know whether or not\nit has been successful. The most basic premise of strategy-\nstriving for superior performance\u2014is violated if performance is\n\n\n\nnot measured.\n\nAddressing the New Agenda\n\nHow can foundations begin down the path we have outlined? A\nnumber of foundations, including those operating under the new\nrubric of venture philanthropy, are already moving in the\ndirection outlined here. But none that we have encountered has\ngone all the way. Putting these elements together into a coherent\nwhole will require developing a strategy, aligning operations with\nthat strategy, and revising the foundation&#x27;s governance so that the\nstrategy can be monitored effectively. Responsibility for such\nchange lies ultimately with the trustees and directors, who are the\nfiduciaries accountable for the use of the foundation&#x27;s (and\nsociety&#x27;s) funds.\n\nTo develop a strategy  the place to start is positioning. This always\nrequires systematic thought and research into important social\nchallenges that are not being addressed well by others. The goal is\nnot necessarily to identify the most important problem,since\nmany are important.W hat matters is how effectively the\nfou nd at ion  can  co n trib u te  to  its  so lu tion .\n\nSecond, a foundation can learn from prior efforts within its\nchosen area of funding. Do current socioeconomic trends favor\none approach over another? What are other organizations doing\nin  th e  fie ld? Can the  work  of th is  foun da tion  re in fo rce  o r\n\ncomplement theirs? Can we uncover root causes of the problem?\n\nThird,what unique strengths will enable this foundation to create\nvalue most effectively in its field? Part of the answer to this\nquestion comes from examining objectively where the foundation\nhas made the greatest impact in the past. It also comes from a\nre alist ic  assessm e n t  o f w eakne sses.\n\n\n\nScale plays an important role in the choice of strategy. A\nfoundation  needs enough  resources to pursue its particular way of\n\ncreating value.Larger foundations may well have the scale to\nwork in more than one field. If they choose to do so, each area\nmust have its own strategy and tailored operations. All\nfoundations, however, can create more value by putting a greater\nproportion of their resources to work.  This means stepping up the\nrate of giving in their chosen fields and investing a portion of\ntheir  investm ent portfolios to support their  philanthropic work.\n\nOnce the foundation has chosen a strategy, it can begin to realign\nits operations.  A foundation, like any enterprise, is a collection of\nmany activities. Each activity-how  proposals are solicited, for\nexample, and how grantees are supported\u2014must be tailored to\nthe chosen strategy  A particularly important aspect of\noperational alignment is the development of measures to help the\nfoundation know whether or not it has been successful.\n\nOperating strategically will require most foundations to rethink\ntheir governance systems. Change will be difficult in an\nenvironment where the pressure of processing grants and getting\nthe money out the door extends beyond the  staff to the\nboardroom. Today boards of all bu t the very  largest foundations\ndiscuss and approve specific grant allocations at th eir meetings.\nWithout goals or strategy, they have no way to delegate the grant\nselection process to staff and no framework through which to\nevaluate their experience.The Chicago-based Crown Foundation,\nin an effort to break this cycle, considers grant requests at only\ntwo of its quarterly board meetings each year; the other two are\nreserved for discussing policy, reviewing performance, and\nstudying issues in more depth. Boards need to move away from\nthe operating function of approving grants to focus on setting\nstrategy and evaluating outcomes.\n\n\n\nWith goals, a strategy, and evaluation mechanisms in place,staff\ncould have greater independence to make grant decisions\nthemselves on a more timely and flexible basis. At the Colorado\nTrust,the board considers and approves multiyear, multimillion-\ndollar initiatives that have clearly defined goals and a clearly\narticulated strategy  Once the board sets the  framework, program\nstaff has the authority to make individual grants for the life of the\ninitiative. Staff members, then, have greater responsibility and\nmore freedom to make decisions on individual grants, and the\nboard  has the tim e to study  the field, set overall strategies, and\nassess staff performance.\n\nFor those who care deeply about social problems and work\ntirelessly to make a difference, current foundation practices not\nonly diminish effectiveness,they inevitably reduce the\nsatisfaction that donors, staff, and trustees derive from their\nwork. Scattered funding, arm&#x27;s-length relationships with\ngrantees, and a lack of awareness of outcomes necessarily create a\ndivide between the foundation and the ultimate results of its\nwork.Acting strategically is much more difficult. But for trustees\nand staff alike, it will be far more rewarding as well.\n\nImproving the performance of philanthropy would enable\nfoundations to have a much greater impact on society.\nFoundations could play a leading role in changing the culture of\nsocial sector management.They could spearhead the evolution of\nphilanthropy from private acts of conscience into a professional\nfield. Until foundations accept their accountability to society and\nmeet their obligation to create value, they exist in a world where\nthey cannot fail.Unfortunately, they also cannot truly succeed.\nA version of this article appeared in the November-December 1999 issue of\nHarvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nMichael E.

By focusing on relationship-building and strategic engagement, development can turn one-time donors into lifelong supporters\u200b\u200b.\n\nIn practice, an organization committed to cooperative models and equity might implement these concepts by:\n\n*   **Engaging Community**: Involving community members not just as donors but as active participants in planning and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that fundraising and development activities are closely aligned with the community&#x27;s needs and values.\n*   **Transparency and Accountability**: Clearly communicating how funds are used and demonstrating the impact of donations on the community. This transparency can build trust and deepen donor engagement.\n*   **Diversifying Funding Sources**: By not relying solely on traditional forms of fundraising but exploring various forms of revenue generation such as social enterprises or membership programs that contribute to financial stability and mission alignment\u200b\u200b.\n\nThese strategies not only enhance fundraising efforts but ensure that they contribute to the broader goal of creating a more equitable and happy society.", "request_id": "8888eaddfe9c0e1d-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fa18987e-bcd4-4b05-a1ac-b0fba59b17a2", "children": ["b7781fe0-7a45-41cf-abbe-be87a20d9b1d"]}, "b7781fe0-7a45-41cf-abbe-be87a20d9b1d": {"id": "b7781fe0-7a45-41cf-abbe-be87a20d9b1d", "message": {"id": "b7781fe0-7a45-41cf-abbe-be87a20d9b1d", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716507904.102767, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8888eaddfe9c0e1d-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null, "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa204e9-f69f-4dd7-9695-38909e74a165", "children": ["e2bf722b-6cf3-4713-a370-fe2c73488620"]}, "e2bf722b-6cf3-4713-a370-fe2c73488620": {"id": "e2bf722b-6cf3-4713-a370-fe2c73488620", "message": {"id": "e2bf722b-6cf3-4713-a370-fe2c73488620", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1716507932.623913, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["From the information gathered across several sources, it&#x27;s evident that development and fundraising, while often used interchangeably, have distinct roles within an organization.

To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.
