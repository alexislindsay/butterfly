By analyzing traffic percentage, businesses can determine the effectiveness of their social media activities in directing users to their website. Monitoring changes in this percentage over time can also help in understanding the impact of specific campaigns or content.\n\n**Tracking Influence**: Influence is typically measured by the reach of your content and the actions that follow. This includes how widely your content is shared, the engagement it receives, and how it affects public perception and behavior towards the brand. Influence can also extend to thought leadership, where the content shared impacts industry conversations and positions the brand as an authoritative voice in its field.\n\nHere&#x27;s how these targets fit into a campaign&#x27;s measurement strategy:\n\n- **Traffic Percentage**: Analyzing referral traffic from social media platforms to your website via analytics tools can reveal not only the volume of traffic but also user behavior, such as time on site, pages visited, and conversion actions taken.\n\n- **Tracking Influence**: Tools like social listening platforms, influencer analytics, and engagement metrics can track how a brand or individual&#x27;s influence grows over time. Metrics such as share of voice in social conversations, follower growth, and mentions across platforms are critical for gauging influence.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to have proper tracking in place, typically through UTM parameters and analytics platforms, to accurately measure these metrics.

They are legitimate and important analytics functionalities that help in understanding user behavior. Here\u2019s how each one works:\n\n1. **Event Tracking**: This captures user interactions with content that can be tracked independently from a web page or a screen load. Examples include downloads, link clicks, form submissions, and video plays. Event tracking provides insights into user behavior without necessarily increasing page views.\n\n2. **Cross-Domain Tracking**: This is used to track user activity across different domains. It provides a unified view of user interactions that take place across multiple websites that belong to the same entity. This type of tracking is particularly useful for understanding the full customer journey in environments where a user may move between related websites, such as from a promotional microsite to the main e-commerce site.\n\n3. **E-Commerce Tracking**: This provides insights into user interactions with e-commerce elements like shopping carts and transactions. It\u2019s used to track sales, product performance, and the checkout process, giving a comprehensive view of e-commerce effectiveness.\n\n4. **Subdomain Tracking**: For a website with multiple subdomains (e.g., shop.example.com and blog.example.com), subdomain tracking allows you to track user activity across all of these as a single entity. This helps in analyzing user behavior across different sections of the same website which may be categorized under separate subdomains.\n\n5. **Virtual Page Views**: These are used to track views of content that doesn&#x27;t correspond to a traditional webpage load, such as a user interaction that generates content dynamically. Virtual page views are valuable for single-page applications, modal dialog boxes, or Ajax-loaded content, where an actual page reload doesn\u2019t occur, but you still want to track interaction as a page view.\n\nEach of these methods enhances the ability to measure and analyze user behavior more accurately without artificially inflating actual page view numbers. They help in gaining a deeper understanding of how users engage with a website and can inform more data-driven decisions for website optimization and marketing strategies. However, it\u2019s important to implement these tracking methods correctly to ensure the data collected is both accurate and useful."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-H73sLSP2I", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2ec22-3307-46b5-aa6b-af18718d33f8", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "87a22840cd5574e4-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2ec22-3307-46b5-aa6b-af18718d33f8", "children": ["aaa24150-4951-49a8-851b-e9834c0d25d2"]}, "aaa24150-4951-49a8-851b-e9834c0d25d2": {"id": "aaa24150-4951-49a8-851b-e9834c0d25d2", "message": {"id": "aaa24150-4951-49a8-851b-e9834c0d25d2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714088259.438146, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["but like with google analytics which one is it, like whats the best answer of those 5"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87a229839a6c74e4-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "3170f986-5da9-4586-9463-63a86fd04c11", "children": ["4c672f94-6617-44c7-8cce-0db10ef91aa8"]}, "4c672f94-6617-44c7-8cce-0db10ef91aa8": {"id": "4c672f94-6617-44c7-8cce-0db10ef91aa8", "message": {"id": "4c672f94-6617-44c7-8cce-0db10ef91aa8", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714088310.676111, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["In the context of Google Analytics, none of these methods inherently cause artificial increases in page views:\n\n1. **Event Tracking** is typically used to measure user interactions with elements on a site that do not result in a new page being loaded, like video plays or button clicks.\n   \n2. **Cross-Domain Tracking** is used to follow user sessions across different domains, which is essential for understanding user journeys that involve multiple domains but does not increase page views.\n   \n3. **E-Commerce Tracking** tracks user interactions related to online shopping activities; it doesn&#x27;t inflate page views but records transactions and related metrics.\n   \n4. **Subdomain Tracking** allows you to see traffic for subdomains (like blog.example.com and shop.example.com) as a unified set of data in Google Analytics without increasing the number of page views.\n\n5. **Virtual Page Views** can track user interactions as if they were actual page views, which could potentially increase the number of page views reported.

Virtual audio cables act like a digital sound device that can route audio between applications, providing a way to mix and manipulate audio streams.\n\n### Steps to Set Up Virtual Audio Cable for Paltalk:\n\n1. **Download and Install a Virtual Audio Cable Software:**\n   - There are several options like VB-Cable, Virtual Audio Cable, or JACK Audio Connection Kit. VB-Cable is a popular and straightforward choice that is free for basic use.\n   - Download it from the official website and install it following the provided instructions.\n\n2. **Set Up Your Playback Device:**\n   - Go to the Sound settings in your operating system.\n   - Set the virtual audio cable as your default playback device. This will route all system sounds, including your music player, to the virtual cable.\n\n3. **Configure Paltalk to Use Virtual Audio Cable:**\n   - Open Paltalk and go to its audio settings.\n   - Set the microphone input to the virtual audio cable output. This makes Paltalk receive audio from the virtual cable instead of your microphone.\n\n4. **Mix Microphone and Music:**\n   - To simultaneously use your microphone and play music, you\u2019ll need an additional software mixer like VoiceMeeter (also by VB-Audio) or similar audio mixing software.\n   - Install and open the mixer software.\n   - Set one input to your microphone and another to the music or system sound you wish to play.\n   - Configure the output of the mixer to go back into the virtual audio cable.\n\n5. **Testing and Adjustments:**\n   - Play music and speak into your microphone. Adjust levels and settings in your mixer software to ensure both the music and your voice are clear.\n   - Test the setup in Paltalk by entering a room and checking if both your music and voice are audible to others.\n\n### Tips for Using This Setup:\n- **Monitor Your Output:** Use headphones to monitor the output from the virtual mixer to manage the balance between your voice and the music.\n- **Check for Delays:** Ensure there is minimal latency or delay in the audio. Some virtual cables or mixers might introduce latency, which can affect synchronization.\n- **Regularly Update Software:** Keep your virtual audio cable and mixer software up to date to avoid compatibility issues with updates in your operating system or Paltalk.\n\nUsing a virtual audio cable and audio mixer software is an effective way to manage multiple audio streams in applications like Paltalk, especially when you want to enhance your interactions with background music or other audio effects without relying on hardware options like Stereo Mix."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2124e-e55e-4940-8ba3-42753618969f", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "879a47190b0b74e4-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2124e-e55e-4940-8ba3-42753618969f", "children": ["aaa2d376-ecc8-4892-b517-a21f0a396c71"]}, "aaa2d376-ecc8-4892-b517-a21f0a396c71": {"id": "aaa2d376-ecc8-4892-b517-a21f0a396c71", "message": {"id": "aaa2d376-ecc8-4892-b517-a21f0a396c71", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714005674.159683, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["is virtual dj a mix software?

When you print an HTML page, the formatting defined by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and any inline styles will generally be preserved in the printout, as long as the print settings and the page\u2019s CSS are properly configured to do so. Here are the steps and considerations for printing an HTML document with its formatting intact:\n\n### 1. **Check the Print CSS Media Queries**\nMany websites use media queries in their CSS to define different styles for screen and print scenarios. You should ensure that the print styles are defined in the CSS. This might look something like this:\n```css\n@media print {\n    body {\n        color: black;\n        background: none;\n    }\n    header, footer, nav, aside {\n        display: none;\n    }\n    /* More print-specific styles */\n}\n```\nThese rules ensure that certain elements are hidden in print mode and that the text and backgrounds are printer-friendly.\n\n### 2. **Use a Browser to Print**\nTo print the HTML document directly from a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge), follow these steps:\n- Open the HTML document in your browser.\n- Go to the browser\u2019s menu (typically found in the upper right corner) and select **Print** or use the shortcut **Ctrl+P** (Cmd+P on Mac).\n- The print preview window will appear, showing how the document will look when printed. This window usually allows you to adjust settings like the number of copies, color options"]}, "status": "in_progress", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "A", "parent_id": "aaa21622-6f77-471e-bdac-35c9faa47b8d", "finish_details": {"type": "interrupted"}, "request_id": "87a1f2735d9474ea-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa21622-6f77-471e-bdac-35c9faa47b8d", "children": ["aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7"]}, "aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7": {"id": "aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7", "message": {"id": "aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714086029.411001, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I mean without rendering the page\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87a1f3100dfb74ea-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8e9a2a7f-5474-4307-8da5-20d25673c653", "children": ["338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7"]}, "338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7": {"id": "338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7", "message": {"id": "338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714086071.849156, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If you want to print an HTML document with all its formatting without rendering it in a browser, you&#x27;re looking at a more complex scenario. HTML is inherently designed to be rendered in a browser, which interprets the HTML and CSS to display the formatted content. However, there are a few methods you might consider to achieve a printed version of an HTML document directly, depending on your needs and environment:\n\n### 1. **Using Command Line Tools**\nCertain command-line tools can render and print HTML files directly to a printer or to a PDF file, effectively bypassing the need for manual rendering in a browser. Tools like `wkhtmltopdf` or `puppeteer` are examples:\n\n- **wkhtmltopdf**: Converts HTML to PDF using WebKit rendering engine. It can be used to create a PDF that could then be printed. \n  ```bash\n  wkhtmltopdf page.html output.pdf\n  ```\n\n- **Puppeteer**: A Node library which provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer can be used to automate browser tasks including rendering HTML to PDF or directly sending a page to a printer.\n  ```javascript\n  const puppeteer = require(&#x27;puppeteer&#x27;);\n\n  async function printHTML() {\n    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n    const page = await browser.newPage();\n    await page.goto(&#x27;file:///path/to/your/file.html&#x27;, {waitUntil: &#x27;networkidle0&#x27;});\n    await page.pdf({path: &#x27;output.pdf&#x27;, format: &#x27;A4&#x27;});\n\n    await browser.close();\n  }\n\n  printHTML();\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Using a PDF Printer Driver**\nIf you have software installed that allows for printing to a PDF &#x27;printer,&#x27; this can be another method to print HTML without rendering it in a browser. You would still need to open and print the HTML document in some application that interprets HTML (like a text editor with print functionality or a lightweight viewer), but this doesn&#x27;t require full browser rendering.\n\n### 3. **Server-Side Rendering Tools**\nFor web applications, server-side rendering tools can generate a fully rendered HTML page (including executing JavaScript and applying CSS) which could then be sent directly to a physical or virtual printer.\n\n### 4. **Convert HTML to Another Format**\nIf you have a development environment, consider writing a script using a library capable of parsing HTML and CSS and converting them into another document format (like PDF or RTF) that can be easily printed. Libraries available in Python, Java, or .NET, for instance, can parse HTML content and apply styles to generate documents.\n\nEach of these methods involves some degree of &quot;rendering,&quot; albeit not necessarily within a traditional web browser environment. The key is converting HTML/CSS into a format that can be understood by printing devices or services."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "87a1f3100dfb74ea-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa25b3a-73f9-4239-95b9-4362d4f399f7", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "338cfdf7-cc13-4f15-9035-fce3926150b7", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "755fba8f-f958-474e-ad2b-b4567de1798f", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "755fba8f-f958-474e-ad2b-b4567de1798f"}, {"title": "Clumsiness: Causes and Solutions", "create_time": 1714063343.734061, "update_time": 1714064349.206128, "mapping": {"23779026-32cc-4079-b55f-70f8c1d15fed": {"id": "23779026-32cc-4079-b55f-70f8c1d15fed", "message": {"id": "23779026-32cc-4079-b55f-70f8c1d15fed", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "333f8a4f-9228-4699-bcc7-aadccdb55964", "children": ["1867a364-4b9b-4e25-98fb-e265af0b7b2b"]}, "333f8a4f-9228-4699-bcc7-aadccdb55964": {"id": "333f8a4f-9228-4699-bcc7-aadccdb55964", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["23779026-32cc-4079-b55f-70f8c1d15fed"]}, "1867a364-4b9b-4e25-98fb-e265af0b7b2b": {"id": "1867a364-4b9b-4e25-98fb-e265af0b7b2b", "message": {"id": "1867a364-4b9b-4e25-98fb-e265af0b7b2b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714063343.735693, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Why are people clumsy?

This lack of understanding can lead to impatience and criticism instead of support.\n\n3. **Stress and Pressure**: In high-stress environments or situations where precision is critical, clumsy actions can exacerbate tension, leading to outbursts of yelling as a stress response.\n\n4. **Habit and Impulse**: In some cases, yelling might be a habitual or impulsive reaction to unexpected events or disruptions, reflecting more about the person\u2019s way of handling irritation or surprise than about the clumsiness itself.\n\nEncouraging a more empathetic and patient approach, and understanding the causes behind clumsiness, might help in responding more constructively when such incidents occur."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "A", "parent_id": "e0de08db-29cb-4213-b81e-886301d5c8c4", "request_id": "879fdbfd29b04c42-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e0de08db-29cb-4213-b81e-886301d5c8c4", "children": ["c39f74e6-58b7-41b5-b63a-a7cbe1753e1d"]}, "c39f74e6-58b7-41b5-b63a-a7cbe1753e1d": {"id": "c39f74e6-58b7-41b5-b63a-a7cbe1753e1d", "message": {"id": "c39f74e6-58b7-41b5-b63a-a7cbe1753e1d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714064333.01842, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Say if a petson ised aomeones clumsiness as a gateway for over archimg criticisms about theor character and self saying thimgs like \u201coh, can we ho one day without breaking simeyhing?

Typically, tarot doesn&#x27;t provide exact dates but rather suggests possible outcomes based on the energy surrounding your question.\n\nSince you&#x27;re interested in whether this could happen within 60 days, we can explore this with a bit more depth:\n\n- **Near Future Possibility**: If this card represents the near future, it suggests that you are very close to achieving a significant milestone in your financial journey. This could be a result of long-term planning and smart financial management finally coming to fruition.\n- **Longer-Term Outcome**: However, the King of Pentacles often symbolizes a culmination of efforts over a significant period. Achieving the level of stability and success indicated by this card usually requires sustained effort, wisdom, and maturity in handling resources. \n\nGiven these interpretations, while it&#x27;s possible to see significant positive developments in 60 days, especially if you&#x27;re already well on your path, the full embodiment of the King of Pentacles might typically suggest a longer timeline.

Six of Swords (Short-Term Future)**\nThis card typically represents transition, moving from a place of turbulence to calmer waters. It suggests that in the short term, you might be moving away from financial difficulties towards a more stable situation. This transition may involve literal travel or metaphorical movement in your approach to financial management. It hints at improvements, but these are part of a journey, suggesting that while you may start seeing positive changes within 60 days, the process will be gradual.\n\n**2. Two of Cups (Medium-Term Future)**\nThe Two of Cups is often about partnerships and harmonious relationships. In the context of your financial timeline, this card suggests that forming or strengthening partnerships could be key to your financial success. This might involve business partnerships, collaborations, or beneficial agreements. The presence of this card indicates that these relationships will play a significant role in your financial growth and stability, and are likely to develop beyond the immediate 60 days, helping to foster long-term success.\n\nThese cards suggest a progression from moving out of difficulty towards stability and then leveraging partnerships for growth. The timeline indicates that while positive changes are on the horizon soon, the full realization of your goals, akin to the King of Pentacles, may take a bit longer, developing and solidifying through partnerships and continued transitions.\n\nLet me know if you would like to delve deeper into any aspects of this reading or have other questions!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-zAw2dywIY", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAA", "parent_id": "75e8d6cf-22e3-4eba-9158-5c073e993810", "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8789e1d74e55a262-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "75e8d6cf-22e3-4eba-9158-5c073e993810", "children": ["aaa23bf2-15cd-4668-b05b-fdf7df47c25f"]}, "aaa23bf2-15cd-4668-b05b-fdf7df47c25f": {"id": "aaa23bf2-15cd-4668-b05b-fdf7df47c25f", "message": {"id": "aaa23bf2-15cd-4668-b05b-fdf7df47c25f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713833715.469354, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["nope thats good.

Three of Cups (Current Situation)**\nThis card typically symbolizes community, friendship, and celebrations. It could indicate that the current situation in America is characterized by a strong sense of community and solidarity among groups. This can be positive, reflecting unity and shared goals, but in the context of your question, it might also point to the celebration of certain ideologies that could be divisive if not checked.\n\n**2. Eight of Wands (Obstacles)**\nThe Eight of Wands usually represents speed and rapid movement. As an obstacle in this context, it suggests that changes and developments are happening very quickly, potentially too fast for effective responses or controls. This rapid pace might be preventing a thoughtful discourse or thorough examination of the directions in which society is moving.\n\n**3. Ten of Swords (Recommended Actions)**\nThis card often signifies defeat, betrayal, and painful endings, but as advice, it suggests facing up to these difficult endings and accepting the reality of the situation. It calls for acknowledging the depth of the challenges or &quot;betrayals&quot; in societal values and to start thinking about recovery and learning from these hard lessons.\n\n**4. Queen of Cups (Outcome)**\nThe Queen of Cups is a card of compassion, emotional stability, and nurturing. As a potential outcome, it offers a hopeful note, suggesting that the future could be guided by empathy, understanding, and emotional intelligence. This card encourages fostering a leadership style or societal ethos that prioritizes care, respect for emotional expressions, and the healing of divisions.\n\nThis spread seems to suggest that while there are rapid and potentially worrying changes occurring, the focus should be on honest acknowledgment of these issues and moving towards a leadership or communal approach that emphasizes compassion and emotional wisdom. This could avert a negative trajectory and instead foster a more inclusive and emotionally intelligent society.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarity, feel free to ask!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-zAw2dywIY", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "5262318b-c32c-453e-b25d-f0ba7efcf7b5", "request_id": "8789e3b549daa262-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5262318b-c32c-453e-b25d-f0ba7efcf7b5", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "f49941a4-d7cd-4b64-b83b-ef9fbbcc02cc", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "581bb4b7-4767-4b61-ab47-9b2bf071f89a", "conversation_template_id": "g-zAw2dywIY", "gizmo_id": "g-zAw2dywIY", "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": ["https://www.buymeacoffee.com/starseedtarot"], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "581bb4b7-4767-4b61-ab47-9b2bf071f89a"}, {"title": "Sandwich Recipe with Pantry Ingredients", "create_time": 1713654954.364448, "update_time": 1713655074.165244, "mapping": {"84391b7f-ad85-4fab-9acb-1ba1711aac87": {"id": "84391b7f-ad85-4fab-9acb-1ba1711aac87", "message": {"id": "84391b7f-ad85-4fab-9acb-1ba1711aac87", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa175ca-04fe-497c-90c6-82c60a3e7ad3", "children": ["aaa25ed4-3593-46e6-89c0-ab51e91ad7cb"]}, "aaa175ca-04fe-497c-90c6-82c60a3e7ad3": {"id": "aaa175ca-04fe-497c-90c6-82c60a3e7ad3", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["84391b7f-ad85-4fab-9acb-1ba1711aac87"]}, "aaa25ed4-3593-46e6-89c0-ab51e91ad7cb": {"id": "aaa25ed4-3593-46e6-89c0-ab51e91ad7cb", "message": {"id": "aaa25ed4-3593-46e6-89c0-ab51e91ad7cb", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713654954.36551, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Could you ask me to list five ingredients from my pantry, and then help me invent a new sandwich recipe using them?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8778d6c7ae5e74e4-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "84391b7f-ad85-4fab-9acb-1ba1711aac87", "children": ["a52d7256-4e2a-436e-a814-8f49acc4c7a0"]}, "a52d7256-4e2a-436e-a814-8f49acc4c7a0": {"id": "a52d7256-4e2a-436e-a814-8f49acc4c7a0", "message": {"id": "a52d7256-4e2a-436e-a814-8f49acc4c7a0", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713654954.921605, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Sure thing!

The tasks usually require following straightforward instructions.\n\n4. **Crowdsourcing Projects**: Some companies offer work through crowdsourcing, where tasks are distributed among a large pool of workers online. Examples include transcription services like Rev or translation services like Gengo.\n\n5. **Creative Content Platforms**: If you are a writer, designer, or artist, platforms like Medium or Society6 allow creators to earn based on their content or designs without a traditional hiring process.\n\nThese platforms typically require you to set up a profile and may involve tests or approval processes, but they don&#x27;t usually include a formal interview.

Here are a few:\n\n1. **Textbroker** - This site offers freelance writing opportunities where writers are rated based on an initial writing test. Your rating can determine the level of jobs you can access and the pay rate.\n\n2. **Verblio** - Verblio requires prospective writers to submit writing samples and may have tests as part of the application process. Once accepted, writers can choose from various writing jobs posted by clients.\n\n3. **iWriter** - Writers must submit an application and are rated based on a qualification test. Like Textbroker, your rating affects the assignments you can accept and the compensation you receive.\n\n4. **Domainite** - A platform that requires applicants to complete a writing test to start working on projects. It is known for being beginner-friendly, though the pay might be lower than some other sites.\n\n5. **BKA Content** - This service requires writers to pass a writing test and a grammar test to qualify to write for their various clients. Writers choose from available projects based on their qualifications.\n\n6. **Crowd Content** - Writers on Crowd Content need to submit an application and pass a quiz and writing test to get started. Writers can work on a variety of content types, including articles, blog posts, and social media content.\n\nThese platforms typically assess your writing skills and command of the language through these tests, and then allow you to start taking on tasks if you pass. They vary in terms of pay, quality of assignments, and potential for long-term work, so it&#x27;s worth exploring a few to see which fits your needs best."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa27f33-db15-4c3c-9b71-199be787f415", "request_id": "875b85715c5a4c6c-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa27f33-db15-4c3c-9b71-199be787f415", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "917eb2c9-f89f-45fc-a625-57d9ea23f346", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "a0744516-8ff9-4ed0-93ec-4bbf3b98d6cd", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "a0744516-8ff9-4ed0-93ec-4bbf3b98d6cd"}, {"title": "Knight of Pentacles Efficiency", "create_time": 1713346737.334005, "update_time": 1713346833.310279, "mapping": {"2cb7363d-aae7-4a90-aa56-2e8d0d1ee9f4": {"id": "2cb7363d-aae7-4a90-aa56-2e8d0d1ee9f4", "message": {"id": "2cb7363d-aae7-4a90-aa56-2e8d0d1ee9f4", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa14510-1f1f-4af1-9018-5f42a01c9f4f", "children": ["d8417e4a-1ad8-4af3-8ebb-0bfb7d05d859"]}, "aaa14510-1f1f-4af1-9018-5f42a01c9f4f": {"id": "aaa14510-1f1f-4af1-9018-5f42a01c9f4f", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["2cb7363d-aae7-4a90-aa56-2e8d0d1ee9f4"]}, "d8417e4a-1ad8-4af3-8ebb-0bfb7d05d859": {"id": "d8417e4a-1ad8-4af3-8ebb-0bfb7d05d859", "message": {"id": "d8417e4a-1ad8-4af3-8ebb-0bfb7d05d859", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-W2oZvtBYi0ji7o7i0JAGvBlh", "name": "pull_tarot_cards.py", "mimeType": "text/x-python"}, {"id": "file-eQ4pksZEQ2mr3GBoVDHN6zEd", "name": "tarot_prompts_2.md", "mimeType": ""}, {"id": "file-Ke9vAm3FY8iVk26LSKcHiwWq", "name": "aurora_profile_v2.md", "mimeType": ""}], "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "2cb7363d-aae7-4a90-aa56-2e8d0d1ee9f4", "children": ["aaa21697-5ada-4dc3-9c6e-7efbd3e4facb"]}, "aaa21697-5ada-4dc3-9c6e-7efbd3e4facb": {"id": "aaa21697-5ada-4dc3-9c6e-7efbd3e4facb", "message": {"id": "aaa21697-5ada-4dc3-9c6e-7efbd3e4facb", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713346737.335304, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Can I have a 1-card drawing for my day today?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "875b71efdb86525c-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "d8417e4a-1ad8-4af3-8ebb-0bfb7d05d859", "children": ["5fa562e5-c9a5-4e5c-88a9-62aedf5d3d86"]}, "5fa562e5-c9a5-4e5c-88a9-62aedf5d3d86": {"id": "5fa562e5-c9a5-4e5c-88a9-62aedf5d3d86", "message": {"id": "5fa562e5-c9a5-4e5c-88a9-62aedf5d3d86", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713346831.988673, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Welcome to Starseed Tarot, your unique destination for personal tarot readings!

We led the supervisors, which led the bus operators. Uh, we had a bit of a clunky process for handling, um, customer complaints that were related directly to a specific bus operator, where it was sort of like customer service would dip their toe in and do a little bit of investigation, like maybe look at the video and go from there, like to kind of give the customer that sort of satisfaction of, you know, answering their complaint right then and there if possible. But sort of for more graver matters, or maybe like if a bus operator had like a verbal altercation with a passenger or just different sort of issues, um, it might, that might provoke like disciplinary action. We needed to do like a thorough investigation about this, especially since many of our employees were, um, contract employees, meaning that, um, they worked under a collective bargaining agreement. And so we really needed to be clear in when we applied some sort of, uh, discipline to them or seeing that they violated any rules. And so anyway, long story short, um, I just felt like it was very clunky the way it would go through customer service. Then it would come to our department, our group, and, um, the service delivery managers would have to take all the customer complaints that were for their zone, like their part of the city that they handled, and, um, give them to the bus supervisors to fully investigate. What is investigation? They would pull the video from the bus, which included audio. They would interview the bus operator about the event, and, um, they would kind of, uh, review any sort of radio communication that might have occurred at the time and sort of to come to a conclusion about what might have occurred, if there were any sort of violations, et cetera. And then if we did find that there was something that was a violation and required disciplinary action, at that point, we needed to, um, initiate disciplinary proceedings. Like, um, basically it was like, uh, I forget what they called it. It was like, almost like court. Anyways, long story short, I thought this is too much. This is not helping customer service skills develop amongst bus operators. This is not an efficient way to do it because these investigations take time. Who is going to remember the conversation they had with a passenger? Maybe sometimes in passing, like they just told them, no, you can&#x27;t bring your, um, pet dog on the bus. Things like this, you know, things of this nature. Um, so what I thought would be better, and I kind of brought this to my manager and we implemented this plan, is that, um, you instead, customer service would give all of these customer complaints to us. We would, A, use it as, um, a learning experience for the bus operators, not so much a learning experience, but like, uh, uh, opportunity for development. And we would, instead of doing our own investigation alone, we would sit down with them in the very outset with the video and the customer complaint. And we&#x27;d sort of review the video, discuss it with them, see what their thoughts were and develop an action plan. And if we felt like, well, maybe like sometimes, a lot of times they said, oh, I was upset that day. But if they felt like they could have done a better job, we set up an action plan so that it never happens again. Um, if it&#x27;s something that is like a clear violation of rules, and then we need to continue with disciplinary proceedings, um, at times the action plan would stood in place, like this was their first try. And if they had a problem with this in the past, then we sort of proceed to the next step in the disciplinary process. And the action plan is just sort of irrelevant. But my idea was this action plan and this sit down meeting with them. And then a couple of weeks later, we would sit down with them again, just kind of checking in, see how they&#x27;re doing with it. And it was a great way to kind of touch bases with the employees to kind of get a pulse for them. And at the same time handle these customer complaints, because afterwards, we would go back to customer service, give them a full report kind of via email, mind you in the system. And sometimes they would have the kind of the go ahead to reach back out to the customer and if it warranted give them free stuff or whatever. In any case, this plan really had such a positive impact. We found that generally we would get regarding bus operates, we would get something like 50 to 100 complaints a month, you know, it ranged. Afterwards, and it was usually more towards the hundred, you know. Afterwards, though, we found that there was almost like a I would say about a 10 to 15% reduction in the sort of like customer complaint incidents where it&#x27;s directed at specifically a bus driver. And I found that we were kind of every month in the range of like 50 to like 80, you know, somewhere between 50 and 80. So 50 and 80, 50, 85, something like this. But the more where it was even more impactful was on bus operator satisfaction. Like when they did the survey, we found that bus operators really had a lot of great things to say about our new process of handling customer complaints. And they appreciated that we involved them in the initial outset of the investigation. We didn&#x27;t just try to decide something and come to them with, oh, you did this wrong. We sort of reviewed it into them and they felt engaged and involved in the process."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "874fd92ebc5559d7-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "1171a8c2-e319-4bac-8292-872103ffecbb", "children": ["8bd8a2c7-dbce-41c5-a135-8670f431e3ae"]}, "8bd8a2c7-dbce-41c5-a135-8670f431e3ae": {"id": "8bd8a2c7-dbce-41c5-a135-8670f431e3ae", "message": {"id": "8bd8a2c7-dbce-41c5-a135-8670f431e3ae", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713225150.625972, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It sounds like you made significant improvements to the process of handling customer complaints involving bus operators at the Jacksonville Transportation Authority.

Hedonism is a school of thought that argues that pleasure is the highest good and proper aim of human life.\n\nEpicureanism, a branch of hedonism founded by Epicurus in the 4th century BCE, might particularly resonate with this idea. Epicurus advocated for the pursuit of moderate, sustainable pleasure as the means to achieve tranquility and freedom from fear, which he considered the highest form of happiness. However, Epicureanism does not merely endorse any form of pleasure; it emphasizes the importance of intellectual pleasures over physical ones and advocates for prudent pleasure-seeking that avoids future pain.\n\nWhile the phrase &quot;If it&#x27;s not fun, it&#x27;s not right&quot; might initially sound like an endorsement of unrestrained pleasure-seeking, it could also be interpreted in an Epicurean sense to mean that activities should contribute positively to one&#x27;s overall happiness without leading to harmful consequences. This interpretation is more nuanced and aligns with Epicurean ideals of seeking long-term well-being through balanced enjoyment."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "b82bfc05-bafb-4e14-9459-cf08f11ec91b", "request_id": "872fd16cdfd14c5b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "b82bfc05-bafb-4e14-9459-cf08f11ec91b", "children": ["b52d2dea-cce0-4dbf-a82a-4c6a0526a7e8"]}, "b52d2dea-cce0-4dbf-a82a-4c6a0526a7e8": {"id": "b52d2dea-cce0-4dbf-a82a-4c6a0526a7e8", "message": {"id": "b52d2dea-cce0-4dbf-a82a-4c6a0526a7e8", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712889704.793289, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes to both, but the former needs further discussion, such as how to handle conflicting states of well-being between two entities whose paths seem crossed, such as Israel and Palestine or Pepsi  co and Coca-Cola co, you know?

Hedonism traditionally focuses on individual pleasure and pain, but in cases involving large groups or entities with conflicting interests, a broader ethical perspective is needed.\n\n**Utilitarianism**, an ethical theory closely related to hedonism but broader in its implications, may offer more insight here. Utilitarianism suggests that the rightness of an action is determined by its contribution to the overall happiness or well-being of the greatest number of people. This principle can be applied to conflicts between groups:\n\n1. **Maximizing Collective Well-being**: In complex situations like geopolitical conflicts or business rivalries, utilitarian ethics would seek solutions that maximize the overall well-being, even if it means compromising individual desires or interests of certain groups. The goal would be to find a solution that produces the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\n2. **Consideration of Long-term Consequences**: Utilitarianism also considers the long-term consequences of actions. In conflicts like those between Israel and Palestine, solutions would need to be sustainable and conducive to long-term peace and well-being, rather than short-term gains.\n\n3. **Fairness and Justice**: Although utilitarianism focuses on maximizing happiness, considerations of fairness and justice are also important, especially in conflicts. It seeks a balance where the distribution of well-being is considered, not just the total amount.\n\n4. **Negotiation and Mediation**: In cases like corporate rivalries between PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, utilitarian principles might encourage competition that promotes innovation and benefits consumers but also supports fair play and ethical business practices.\n\nIn summary, while hedonism can address individual pleasures and pains, utilitarianism extends these ideas to consider the collective well-being, making it more applicable to scenarios involving complex human interactions and conflicts. This approach emphasizes solutions that not only maximize happiness but also distribute it fairly among all parties involved."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "b52d2dea-cce0-4dbf-a82a-4c6a0526a7e8", "request_id": "872fdbecf8de375c-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "b52d2dea-cce0-4dbf-a82a-4c6a0526a7e8", "children": ["67b39329-4eba-4d49-84d9-e9198b2f952d"]}, "67b39329-4eba-4d49-84d9-e9198b2f952d": {"id": "67b39329-4eba-4d49-84d9-e9198b2f952d", "message": {"id": "67b39329-4eba-4d49-84d9-e9198b2f952d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712889857.878939, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes to both, but the former needs further discussion, such as how to handle conflicting states of well-being between two entities whose paths seem ill-crossed, such as Israel and Palestine or PepsiCo Corp and Coca-Cola Co, you know?

Here, theories like **Utilitarianism** and **Contractarianism** could provide frameworks for resolving conflicts:\n\n1. **Utilitarianism**:\n   - **Balancing Well-being**: Utilitarianism seeks to maximize overall happiness or utility. In conflicts, this could involve strategies that aim to increase cooperation or solutions that mitigate harm to all parties involved.\n   - **Long-term vs. Short-term Gains**: Applying utilitarian principles involves evaluating the long-term consequences of decisions, striving for solutions that provide the greatest benefit over time rather than immediate but unsustainable gains.\n\n2. **Contractarianism**:\n   - **Social Contracts**: This theory suggests that moral norms and political arrangements stem from the agreements made by individuals as part of a social contract. In conflict situations, renegotiating terms or finding new agreements that better reflect the current understanding and needs of all parties could be a path to peace.\n   - **Justice and Fairness**: Contractarianism often emphasizes fairness as a basis for the social contract, aiming to ensure that all parties are treated justly according to agreed-upon principles, which could guide negotiations in both political and corporate conflicts.\n\nFor example, in the geopolitical conflict between **Israel and Palestine**, these theories might support:\n- A utilitarian approach focusing on creating policies that maximize the well-being of both populations, possibly through shared economic projects or international mediation that aims for equitable solutions.\n- A contractarian approach might involve renewed peace talks where both parties come together to negotiate terms that reflect mutual respect, sovereignty, and security, based on a revised understanding of what a fair and just social contract would look like.\n\nIn the corporate rivalry between **PepsiCo and Coca-Cola**, these theories could suggest:\n- A utilitarian perspective might encourage competition that drives innovation and consumer benefits, ensuring business practices that maximize overall market health and consumer satisfaction.\n- From a contractarian viewpoint, ensuring fair competition through regulatory frameworks that both parties agree upon, preventing practices that would harm the broader market or consumer interests.\n\nThese approaches encourage considering the broader implications of actions and decisions, aiming for outcomes that promote overall harmony, fairness, and sustained well-being, rather than merely individual or immediate gains."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "67b39329-4eba-4d49-84d9-e9198b2f952d", "request_id": "872fdfa9cf1c375c-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "67b39329-4eba-4d49-84d9-e9198b2f952d", "children": ["19b15e0e-d53b-497b-a1f7-ba96f9e13fa1"]}, "19b15e0e-d53b-497b-a1f7-ba96f9e13fa1": {"id": "19b15e0e-d53b-497b-a1f7-ba96f9e13fa1", "message": {"id": "19b15e0e-d53b-497b-a1f7-ba96f9e13fa1", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712890460.717791, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What about the phrase, I don&#x27;t want to exist peacefully, I want to exist playfully?

Let me run while my heart beats fast&quot; resonates with the philosophical outlook of **Existentialism**, particularly its emphasis on individual freedom, personal authenticity, and living passionately. Existentialist philosophy asserts that individuals are free to choose their paths and are responsible for giving meaning to their lives through these choices. The essence of this phrase captures a desire to live vibrantly and with a sense of personal engagement and joy, elements highly valued in existential thought.\n\nHere&#x27;s how existentialism might relate to and illuminate this sentiment:\n\n1. **Freedom and Choice**: Existentialism holds that each person has the freedom to choose their way of being. This phrase expresses a choice to embrace a life of spontaneity and active engagement rather than passive peacefulness.\n\n2. **Authentic Existence**: The existential focus on authenticity\u2014living in a way that is true to one&#x27;s self rather than conforming to external expectations\u2014is echoed in the desire to &quot;exist playfully.&quot; This suggests living in a manner that feels genuinely fulfilling and expressive of one&#x27;s innermost desires and passions.\n\n3. **Living Passionately**: Many existential philosophers, like S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, spoke about the importance of living passionately and intensely. Nietzsche, in particular, would have appreciated the will to embrace life\u2019s dynamism and challenges as a way to affirm one\u2019s existence.\n\n4. **Overcoming Absurdity**: Albert Camus, another existentialist, talked about life\u2019s inherent absurdity and how one might rebel against this by embracing life fully, despite its irrationality and lack of inherent meaning. The desire to &quot;run while my heart beats fast&quot; can be seen as a metaphor for engaging with life energetically and defiantly, refusing to be subdued by life&#x27;s absurdity.\n\nThis phrase, with its emphasis on playful and energetic existence, captures a deeply existentialist attitude towards life\u2014one that values personal freedom, authenticity, and a passionate engagement with the world."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "19b15e0e-d53b-497b-a1f7-ba96f9e13fa1", "request_id": "872fee618e91badf-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "19b15e0e-d53b-497b-a1f7-ba96f9e13fa1", "children": ["ce83e34e-460a-4456-a660-eead28052f7c"]}, "ce83e34e-460a-4456-a660-eead28052f7c": {"id": "ce83e34e-460a-4456-a660-eead28052f7c", "message": {"id": "ce83e34e-460a-4456-a660-eead28052f7c", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712915276.75198, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Why does it seem like all the schools of thought and philosophies have the right idea and are more or less saying the same things about what&#x27;s the best way to achieve happiness, balance, a certain satisfaction with one&#x27;s life and existence?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87324c3dbbe083b5-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "53a87a3d-ad29-4c5e-bf4d-0efbab0b1b8e", "children": ["e3720750-9c39-435e-ab85-b9428bd6fe62"]}, "e3720750-9c39-435e-ab85-b9428bd6fe62": {"id": "e3720750-9c39-435e-ab85-b9428bd6fe62", "message": {"id": "e3720750-9c39-435e-ab85-b9428bd6fe62", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712915321.824956, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"rebase_system_message": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "ce83e34e-460a-4456-a660-eead28052f7c", "request_id": "87324c3dbbe083b5-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ce83e34e-460a-4456-a660-eead28052f7c", "children": ["ec0a959f-d707-47df-8349-da782e8f2446"]}, "ec0a959f-d707-47df-8349-da782e8f2446": {"id": "ec0a959f-d707-47df-8349-da782e8f2446", "message": {"id": "ec0a959f-d707-47df-8349-da782e8f2446", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712915321.825659, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The observation that many philosophical schools seem to offer converging advice on achieving happiness, balance, and satisfaction can be attributed to several reasons, reflecting the universal pursuit of well-being and the common human experiences across different cultures and epochs:\n\n1. **Universal Human Concerns**: At their core, most philosophies address universal aspects of the human condition\u2014desires for happiness, meaning, and a sense of belonging. These are fundamental to all human societies, which leads to similarities in the philosophical solutions and ethical guidelines proposed across different cultures and historical periods.\n\n2. **Adaptive Responses**: Philosophical systems often arise as adaptive responses to the existential questions and practical needs of societies. They evolve to promote social cohesion, individual well-being, and survival, which can lead to similar conclusions about values like cooperation, fairness, and personal fulfillment.\n\n3. **Shared Inspirations and Influences**: Philosophical traditions often influence each other. Ideas travel through trade, conquest, scholarship, and communication, leading to shared themes and integrated doctrines across different philosophical systems. For instance, the works of Plato and Aristotle influenced not just Western philosophy but also Islamic and Eastern thought to varying degrees.\n\n4. **The Role of Reason and Experience**: Philosophers from different traditions often use reason and empirical observations to arrive at their conclusions, which can lead to converging ideas about what works best in human life. For example, both the Stoics and Buddhists independently developed practices for managing desires and emotions to achieve a state of inner peace.\n\n5. **The Practical Test of Time**: Philosophies that effectively enhance human life tend to endure and spread, while less effective ideas fade. Thus, the philosophies that we are aware of today are often those that have been practically successful in promoting well-being across different contexts, leading to a semblance of consensus on certain principles.\n\n6. **Diverse Paths, Same Goals**: While the core goals of many philosophies may appear similar\u2014seeking happiness and fulfillment\u2014the paths proposed to reach these goals can vary widely, reflecting different metaphysical beliefs, ethical priorities, and cultural values. This diversity in approach underscores the adaptability of philosophical inquiry to the unique conditions and needs of different human societies.\n\nIn summary, while there are core similarities in what many philosophical traditions aim to achieve, the richness of philosophical inquiry lies in the diverse and culturally specific ways these goals are pursued and conceptualized. This reflects a deeper truth about the nature of human inquiry: different paths can lead to similar destinations, especially when navigating the complex terrain of human experience."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "e3720750-9c39-435e-ab85-b9428bd6fe62", "request_id": "87324c3dbbe083b5-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e3720750-9c39-435e-ab85-b9428bd6fe62", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "ec0a959f-d707-47df-8349-da782e8f2446", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "786f1705-eff9-46e0-8ef1-49cf1140f314", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "786f1705-eff9-46e0-8ef1-49cf1140f314"}, {"title": "Humorous Resume Crafting", "create_time": 1712858194.614005, "update_time": 1712868973.871065, "mapping": {"deb5ee8d-4a6c-4207-bda0-242ae9d41534": {"id": "deb5ee8d-4a6c-4207-bda0-242ae9d41534", "message": {"id": "deb5ee8d-4a6c-4207-bda0-242ae9d41534", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa17197-838a-41aa-975d-d9a60cf82944", "children": ["dda4d7f4-1c8b-4e54-98f4-ef6334bce194"]}, "aaa17197-838a-41aa-975d-d9a60cf82944": {"id": "aaa17197-838a-41aa-975d-d9a60cf82944", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["deb5ee8d-4a6c-4207-bda0-242ae9d41534"]}, "dda4d7f4-1c8b-4e54-98f4-ef6334bce194": {"id": "dda4d7f4-1c8b-4e54-98f4-ef6334bce194", "message": {"id": "dda4d7f4-1c8b-4e54-98f4-ef6334bce194", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [], "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "deb5ee8d-4a6c-4207-bda0-242ae9d41534", "children": ["aaa2b3c3-246a-4c21-a8e3-8b204dd847cd"]}, "aaa2b3c3-246a-4c21-a8e3-8b204dd847cd": {"id": "aaa2b3c3-246a-4c21-a8e3-8b204dd847cd", "message": {"id": "aaa2b3c3-246a-4c21-a8e3-8b204dd847cd", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712858194.615367, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["can you use this info to craft a resume using the same fun tone and language and phrasing: \n\nTo tailor your resume to this unique and humorous job description, it&#x27;s important to mirror the tone and highlight relevant skills and experiences that align with the role&#x27;s demands and the company&#x27;s culture.

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

ATS, or Applicant Tracking Systems, are used by employers to filter resumes before they reach human eyes. Here are some tips to make your resume more ATS-friendly:\n\n1. **Use Standard Headings**: Stick to standard resume headings like &quot;Work Experience,&quot; &quot;Education,&quot; and &quot;Skills.&quot; ATS may not recognize creative headings, causing it to overlook important information.\n\n2. **Keywords**: Review the job description and include relevant keywords and phrases in your resume. These should be specific skills, technologies, qualifications, and experiences that match the job listing.\n\n3. **Simple Formatting**: Use a clean, straightforward format. Avoid using tables, columns, images, or other complex formatting that ATS might not be able to parse. Bullet points are fine, but keep the layout simple.\n\n4. **File Format**: Submit your resume in a format compatible with most ATS, which is usually a .docx or a plain-text file. While PDFs are great for preserving layout, some ATS systems may have trouble reading them.\n\n5. **Professional Font**: Use standard, professional fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman. Keep the font size within 10-12 points for readability.\n\n6. **Avoid Headers and Footers**: Some ATS systems cannot read information placed in headers and footers. Make sure all critical information is within the main body of the document.\n\n7. **Spell Out Acronyms**: Spell out acronyms the first time you use them, followed by the acronym in parentheses. This ensures that whether the ATS searches for the acronym or the full phrase, your resume will be found.\n\n8. **Performance and Results**: Emphasize results and achievements using numbers and specifics that align with the job description&#x27;s keywords and phrases.\n\n9. **Language and Tense**: Use clear, concise language and maintain consistent tense. Present tense for current roles and past tense for previous positions.\n\n10. **Customize for the Job**: Tailor your resume for each application based on the job description. This increases the relevance of your resume to the specific position and makes it more likely to get past the ATS.\n\nIf you have your resume ready and would like a detailed analysis or any specific advice tailored to your resume, feel free to share it for personalized feedback."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-QlBVssYtj", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2742d-d854-4d44-8080-2c5d02bfd5be", "request_id": "872cd37fee865242-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2742d-d854-4d44-8080-2c5d02bfd5be", "children": ["aaa2ce9f-07c3-4d6e-b0b5-b463cabaf1a5"]}, "aaa2ce9f-07c3-4d6e-b0b5-b463cabaf1a5": {"id": "aaa2ce9f-07c3-4d6e-b0b5-b463cabaf1a5", "message": {"id": "aaa2ce9f-07c3-4d6e-b0b5-b463cabaf1a5", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712857944.178241, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\n- Do you enjoy learning about people, then judging them harshly?\n\n- Do you get off on finding diamonds in the rough?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\n \nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don\u2019t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

This approach should catch the eye of a company that prides itself on being different."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-QlBVssYtj", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa226c3-b2a6-46fc-bfac-d993686e9a65", "request_id": "872cd74efbe15242-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa226c3-b2a6-46fc-bfac-d993686e9a65", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "f55f2680-9055-4d36-83ef-d6085999021b", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "8d9b4992-86ea-434c-9d59-98d9bc17d180", "conversation_template_id": "g-QlBVssYtj", "gizmo_id": "g-QlBVssYtj", "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": ["https://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours", "http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/", "https://amz.run/6kip", "https://amz.run/6kin", "https://amz.run/5Eya"], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "8d9b4992-86ea-434c-9d59-98d9bc17d180"}, {"title": "Remote Flexible Work Opportunities", "create_time": 1712857489.135742, "update_time": 1712857772.894123, "mapping": {"08461929-47c9-40c7-b6cb-b650a6c3e933": {"id": "08461929-47c9-40c7-b6cb-b650a6c3e933", "message": {"id": "08461929-47c9-40c7-b6cb-b650a6c3e933", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa1d2f5-fc11-4e6f-bb32-1683cf56d31a", "children": ["fd458837-a0e1-4333-aa45-c7f8ccc66309"]}, "aaa1d2f5-fc11-4e6f-bb32-1683cf56d31a": {"id": "aaa1d2f5-fc11-4e6f-bb32-1683cf56d31a", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["08461929-47c9-40c7-b6cb-b650a6c3e933"]}, "fd458837-a0e1-4333-aa45-c7f8ccc66309": {"id": "fd458837-a0e1-4333-aa45-c7f8ccc66309", "message": {"id": "fd458837-a0e1-4333-aa45-c7f8ccc66309", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [], "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "08461929-47c9-40c7-b6cb-b650a6c3e933", "children": ["aaa2fb06-f198-4b12-a910-031e4cb203ea", "a0925f55-325b-479d-b719-a42bf04c962f", "5b6a75a5-b14d-4d73-b058-abb372e6c330"]}, "aaa2fb06-f198-4b12-a910-031e4cb203ea": {"id": "aaa2fb06-f198-4b12-a910-031e4cb203ea", "message": {"id": "aaa2fb06-f198-4b12-a910-031e4cb203ea", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712857489.137808, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["heres the job description: \n- Do you enjoy learning about people, then judging them harshly?\n\n- Do you get off on finding diamonds in the rough?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\n \nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don\u2019t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor! \n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

However, even with nuclear reactions, the concept of creating a perpetual motion machine faces significant challenges and limitations.\n\nFirstly, in a nuclear reaction where atoms are split (nuclear fission) or combined (nuclear fusion), enormous amounts of energy are released. This energy can indeed be harnessed to initiate further reactions. In fact, this principle is what underpins the operation of nuclear reactors. They use the energy released from fission reactions to maintain a chain reaction, which can be controlled to produce energy over time.\n\nHowever, there are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Resource Limitation**: While atoms are abundant, not all atoms are suitable for sustaining nuclear reactions that release energy. Fission, for example, typically uses isotopes like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, which are not unlimited and require mining and refinement. Fusion, on the other hand, while potentially using more abundant fuels like hydrogen isotopes, still faces enormous technical challenges to maintain and control the reaction.\n\n2. **Energy Losses**: Even in nuclear reactions, not all the energy released can be perfectly captured and used to initiate further reactions. Some energy is always lost to the surroundings as heat. In practical engineering, achieving 100% efficiency in energy conversion is impossible due to these inevitable losses.\n\n3. **Decay and Byproducts**: Nuclear reactions produce radioactive byproducts that must be managed. Over time, the materials used in the reaction can also degrade and become less effective, requiring replacement.\n\nSo, while nuclear reactions can produce vast amounts of energy and can be harnessed in reactors to provide a significant energy source, they don&#x27;t create a perpetual motion machine. The process doesn&#x27;t sustain itself indefinitely without external inputs, such as fuel and maintenance, and it&#x27;s subject to the limitations of efficiency and resource availability.\n\nThis exploration into nuclear energy does highlight how tapping into the fundamental forces of nature can yield incredible power, showcasing the endless quest for more efficient and sustainable energy sources within the bounds of physical laws."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "voice_mode_message": true, "pad": "A", "parent_id": "7b02b96b-2878-400a-af5e-771e8efe2365", "request_id": "d19b9982-edda-4f09-9ab1-bcf30c147f86", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7b02b96b-2878-400a-af5e-771e8efe2365", "children": ["6e271e65-e9a2-4b7e-9385-6a5d59ee7856"]}, "6e271e65-e9a2-4b7e-9385-6a5d59ee7856": {"id": "6e271e65-e9a2-4b7e-9385-6a5d59ee7856", "message": {"id": "6e271e65-e9a2-4b7e-9385-6a5d59ee7856", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712816783.848634, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["All right."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"voice_mode_message": true, "request_id": "e48578ba-3e88-4a40-b06a-f5b46c22893f", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "46e362bb-de2a-43b0-befe-b74969ea2c81", "children": ["4ecd2251-861e-4743-aae8-c6d5891bb082"]}, "4ecd2251-861e-4743-aae8-c6d5891bb082": {"id": "4ecd2251-861e-4743-aae8-c6d5891bb082", "message": {"id": "4ecd2251-861e-4743-aae8-c6d5891bb082", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712816786.371953, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["If you have any more questions or there&#x27;s something else you&#x27;re curious about, feel free to ask.

However, there are several scientific and technical challenges that make such a system, especially as a &quot;perpetual energy machine,&quot; unfeasible with our current understanding and technology.\n\n### Fission and Fusion Basics\n- **Nuclear Fission** is the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei (such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239) into lighter elements, releasing a significant amount of energy. The byproducts of fission are usually a mix of lighter radioactive isotopes and neutrons.\n- **Nuclear Fusion** involves combining light atomic nuclei (such as isotopes of Hydrogen, Deuterium, and Tritium) into heavier nuclei (like Helium), also releasing a vast amount of energy. The conditions for fusion require extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between atomic nuclei.\n\n### Challenges and Considerations\n1. **Different Conditions**: Fission and fusion require vastly different conditions to proceed. Fusion, in particular, requires temperatures and pressures found at the core of stars, which are challenging to achieve and maintain on Earth.\n  \n2. **Material Limitations**: The byproducts of fission are not suitable fuels for fusion. Fission byproducts are typically mid-range atomic number isotopes that are not easily fused. Fusion fuel (like Deuterium and Tritium) is much lighter than these materials.\n  \n3. **Energy Efficiency**: While both processes release energy, converting the byproducts of one process into the fuel for another involves steps that are not 100% efficient. There are always energy losses to the surroundings, and the energy required to convert materials or to initiate reactions (like achieving the conditions for fusion) can exceed the energy gained.\n  \n4. **Radioactive Waste**: Fission, in particular, produces radioactive waste that poses significant environmental and safety challenges. Managing this waste requires resources and can&#x27;t be efficiently turned into a benign or useful state simply through fusion.\n  \n5. **Technological Feasibility**: Currently, controlled fusion as a net energy producer is not yet a practical technology, though research is ongoing. Even if it were, the seamless integration with fission in a cycle as described would require technologies and materials beyond our current capabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe concept you&#x27;ve described touches on the heart of experimental energy research\u2014finding efficient, sustainable ways to produce energy. However, as of now, a system that cycles between fission and fusion in the manner described, acting as a perpetual energy machine, isn&#x27;t possible due to the fundamental laws of physics, material limitations, and technological constraints.\n\nExploring these ideas is essential for pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and capabilities, and who knows what future discoveries might bring in the field of nuclear physics and energy production!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "voice_mode_message": true, "pad": "AAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "f0d35000-7195-4a27-8907-05374f80d6cf", "request_id": "c36b54cc-44f5-4d77-a466-f065f69d557c", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f0d35000-7195-4a27-8907-05374f80d6cf", "children": ["e5a27bd8-c652-4454-b32e-5517ee954f14"]}, "e5a27bd8-c652-4454-b32e-5517ee954f14": {"id": "e5a27bd8-c652-4454-b32e-5517ee954f14", "message": {"id": "e5a27bd8-c652-4454-b32e-5517ee954f14", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712817041.967337, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["How about throwing atoms that repel each other together and harnessing basically the energy produced by them repelling each other?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"voice_mode_message": true, "request_id": "8b111f7c-cca4-4b93-afbd-e1815398e787", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "976d6f54-84a8-4207-9321-41a5e8b86b24", "children": ["3d6096a9-0fe0-4969-9145-bc8bc518e489"]}, "3d6096a9-0fe0-4969-9145-bc8bc518e489": {"id": "3d6096a9-0fe0-4969-9145-bc8bc518e489", "message": {"id": "3d6096a9-0fe0-4969-9145-bc8bc518e489", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712817080.850444, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Your concept taps into the fundamental forces at play within atoms, particularly the electromagnetic force that causes particles with like charges (such as protons within atomic nuclei) to repel each other. Harnessing energy from the repulsion between atoms involves understanding these forces and how they can be manipulated or utilized in practical applications.\n\n### The Basics of Atomic Repulsion\nAtoms repel each other when their electron clouds or positively charged nuclei come into close proximity, due to the electromagnetic force. This force is incredibly strong at very short distances, which is why you can&#x27;t easily push atoms together; they resist due to this repulsion.\n\n### Potential Applications and Challenges\n1. **Fusion Energy**: In a way, nuclear fusion research is trying to do something similar to what you&#x27;re suggesting. Fusion involves pushing light atomic nuclei close enough together that they overcome their electromagnetic repulsion and fuse into a heavier nucleus, releasing energy. This process requires immense temperatures and pressures to overcome the repulsive force between the nuclei.\n\n2. **Particle Accelerators**: Particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider, use electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged particles to high speeds and then smash them together. The collisions release energy and a variety of subatomic particles, allowing scientists to study the fundamental components of matter. This is a controlled way of harnessing energy from the interactions between particles, though it&#x27;s used for research rather than practical energy production.\n\n### Energy Production Challenges\n- **Efficiency**: Any process designed to harness energy from the repulsion between atoms would need to consider energy input versus output. Overcoming the repulsive forces to bring atoms close enough together requires a significant energy investment, which, in most practical scenarios, exceeds the energy that can be harvested from the repulsion.\n\n- **Control and Safety**: Managing the forces involved in such high-energy interactions requires sophisticated technology to control and contain, ensuring safety and preventing uncontrolled releases of energy.\n\n- **Sustainability**: For any energy production method to be viable, it needs to be sustainable and efficient over long periods. This involves not just the energy balance but also the availability of materials and the environmental impact.\n\nWhile the idea of harnessing energy from atomic repulsion is intriguing and taps into real physics principles, practical applications like nuclear fusion are still under development and face significant technical challenges.

These experiments aim to understand the fundamental forces of nature, the basic constituents of matter, and the properties of particles that make up the universe. The collisions create conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang, allowing researchers to study a range of fundamental physics questions.\n\n### Elements and Charges\nIn terms of elements being &quot;singularly charged, but oppositely charged,&quot; all atoms consist of a nucleus containing protons (positively charged) and neutrons (no charge), surrounded by electrons (negatively charged). The entire atom is electrically neutral if it has an equal number of protons and electrons. There aren&#x27;t elements with overall singular, opposite charges; charges within atoms are balanced between the positive nucleus and negative electrons. However, ions are atoms or molecules that have lost or gained electrons and thus carry a net charge.\n\n### Utilizing Particle Colliders for Energy\nIf your idea involves using particle accelerators like those at CERN to harness energy from the electromagnetic repulsion or attraction between charged particles, there are several points to consider:\n\n1. **Purpose of Colliders**: Particle colliders are research tools designed to understand the laws of physics at the smallest scales, not to produce or harness energy for practical use. The energy produced in these collisions is used to create new particles and explore fundamental physics, not for external energy capture.\n\n2. **Energy Efficiency**: The amount of energy required to accelerate particles to the speeds needed for these experiments is immense. The energy recovered from the interactions, while scientifically invaluable, is much less than the energy input. Thus, particle accelerators are net consumers of energy, not sources.\n\n3. **Oppositely Charged Particles**: When oppositely charged particles, like electrons and positrons (the electron&#x27;s antiparticle), collide, they can annihilate, producing energy primarily in the form of high-energy photons (light). This process, while energetically efficient at the particle level, does not lend itself to large-scale energy production due to the challenges in creating, containing, and efficiently using antimatter.\n\n### Practical Energy Production\nFor practical energy production, technologies strive for processes where the energy output exceeds the energy input, like in nuclear fission reactors and, potentially, future fusion reactors. These processes involve large numbers of atoms and reactions that release substantial amounts of energy, more suitable for generating electricity on a scale that can power cities.\n\nIn summary, while particle colliders provide invaluable insights into the fundamental aspects of the universe, they are not designed or suitable for acting as energy production facilities in the way traditional power plants are. The study of charged particles and their interactions, however, continues to be a crucial part of advancing our understanding of physics and could indirectly lead to new energy technologies in the future."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "voice_mode_message": true, "pad": "AAAAAA", "parent_id": "faff7caa-e172-44c4-aa5b-a38676860a12", "request_id": "c3710daf-a348-4377-a908-286f0c0e70cf", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "faff7caa-e172-44c4-aa5b-a38676860a12", "children": ["03088c1c-3f4c-4fb2-bbc1-25434287796e"]}, "03088c1c-3f4c-4fb2-bbc1-25434287796e": {"id": "03088c1c-3f4c-4fb2-bbc1-25434287796e", "message": {"id": "03088c1c-3f4c-4fb2-bbc1-25434287796e", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712817331.801376, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Okay, so what if you did, you know, use these colliders and, you know, produce light and you collided enough and produced enough light to charge a solar panel that led to, you know, power stuff?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"voice_mode_message": true, "request_id": "6c9ae2d6-cfd7-4704-86a8-8d8e6216ba2f", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "14ffbc32-af68-4cb4-a91a-12a40991eaee", "children": ["c24d1096-ec25-4997-942d-a60686a60db1"]}, "c24d1096-ec25-4997-942d-a60686a60db1": {"id": "c24d1096-ec25-4997-942d-a60686a60db1", "message": {"id": "c24d1096-ec25-4997-942d-a60686a60db1", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712817368.106723, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Using particle colliders to produce light for solar panels is a creative idea, intertwining high-energy physics with renewable energy technology. However, there are a few key considerations that highlight the challenges and inefficiencies of this approach:\n\n1. **Energy Efficiency**: Particle colliders, like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, consume a vast amount of energy to accelerate particles to near the speed of light and collide them. The primary goal of these collisions is to study fundamental physics, not to produce energy. The amount of light (in the form of high-energy photons) generated from particle collisions is minuscule compared to the energy input required to operate the collider. Thus, the process is highly inefficient from an energy production standpoint.\n\n2. **Cost and Complexity**: Particle colliders are among the most complex and expensive scientific instruments ever built, designed for advanced research in physics. The cost of building and operating such facilities is enormous, further compounded by the need for highly specialized personnel and infrastructure.\n\n3. **Conversion Efficiency**: Even if we could harvest light from particle collisions, the efficiency of solar panels in converting light to electricity is not 100%. Current commercial solar panels typically have efficiencies ranging from 15% to 22%. This conversion efficiency would further reduce the overall energy efficiency of using colliders for this purpose.\n\n4. **Practicality and Scale**: The scale of energy production from such a process would be extremely limited. Solar panels are most effective when capturing sunlight, which provides a much larger and consistent energy source. The amount of light produced in particle collisions would be insufficient to power more than a very small load, if that.\n\n5. **Safety and Accessibility**: The environments within particle colliders are highly controlled and can be hazardous due to high energy levels and radiation produced during collisions. It would not be practical or safe to integrate such a system with external devices like solar panels.\n\nWhile it&#x27;s important to explore various ideas for producing and harvesting energy, the efficiency and practicality of those ideas are key. Currently, focusing on improving the efficiency of solar panels to capture sunlight directly, or advancing technologies in other renewable energy sectors like wind, hydro, and fusion, offers more promising pathways toward sustainable energy production.

Silicon is a semiconductor, which means it can conduct electricity under certain conditions. This property makes it ideal for converting light into electrical energy.\n\nThere are two main types of silicon used in solar panels:\n\n1. **Monocrystalline Silicon**: Made from single-crystal silicon, monocrystalline panels are easily recognizable by their uniform dark color and rounded edges. They are more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity compared to other types, but they&#x27;re also more expensive. This efficiency comes from the high purity of silicon, which allows electrons to move more freely through the material.\n\n2. **Polycrystalline Silicon (or Multicrystalline Silicon)**: These panels are made from silicon crystals that are melted together. Polycrystalline panels have a blue, somewhat speckled appearance, resulting from the light reflecting off the crystals. They are less efficient than monocrystalline silicon panels but also cheaper to produce.\n\nBesides silicon, solar panels also contain other materials:\n\n- **Glass**: A durable, transparent layer on top that protects the silicon cells while allowing sunlight to pass through.\n- **Metal**: Used in the framing of the panel and the wiring that connects the cells, helping to transport the generated electricity.\n- **Plastic and Other Materials**: Used for the back sheet and encapsulation, providing insulation and protection against environmental conditions.\n\nAdvancements in solar technology have also led to the development of thin-film solar cells, which use materials like cadmium telluride (CdTe) or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). These materials can be applied in thin layers to create flexible, lightweight panels, although they are generally less efficient than silicon-based panels. Despite the differences in materials and efficiency, the goal of all solar panels is the same: to convert sunlight into usable electricity as effectively as possible."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "voice_mode_message": true, "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "90098b56-23ca-4b72-8b97-f877fe039d58", "request_id": "715c547d-6a31-41b5-a191-74cd2b579f24", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "90098b56-23ca-4b72-8b97-f877fe039d58", "children": ["7abbce62-093d-48c7-a3a7-588624bf171b"]}, "7abbce62-093d-48c7-a3a7-588624bf171b": {"id": "7abbce62-093d-48c7-a3a7-588624bf171b", "message": {"id": "7abbce62-093d-48c7-a3a7-588624bf171b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712817502.933266, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["So, which one does NASA use on their space stuffs?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"voice_mode_message": true, "request_id": "86e337c6-be13-481d-a6e6-35feaf0d82f3", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f58f1cda-919d-498f-845b-a1879737e1a6", "children": ["f7599f08-e9f0-4335-ba32-2feb23c4b9f7"]}, "f7599f08-e9f0-4335-ba32-2feb23c4b9f7": {"id": "f7599f08-e9f0-4335-ba32-2feb23c4b9f7", "message": {"id": "f7599f08-e9f0-4335-ba32-2feb23c4b9f7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712817530.707061, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["NASA and other space agencies typically use multi-junction solar cells for their spacecraft, satellites, and other space-based applications. These multi-junction cells are designed to capture a broader range of the solar spectrum compared to traditional silicon-based solar panels.\n\nMulti-junction solar cells are made up of multiple layers of semiconductor materials, each layer designed to absorb a different segment of the solar spectrum. This layered design allows them to convert more of the sunlight they receive into electricity, making them significantly more efficient than single-junction cells, such as those made of silicon. The materials used in these layers can include combinations of gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) among others.\n\nThese high-efficiency solar cells are particularly valuable in space because they produce more power while taking up less space and weight compared to other types of solar cells. This efficiency is crucial for space missions, where the amount of energy that can be generated is limited by the size of the solar panels a spacecraft can carry. However, the advanced materials and technology required to produce multi-junction cells make them much more expensive than conventional solar panels, which is why their use is usually limited to space applications and some high-end terrestrial projects.\n\nAdditionally, for missions that venture far from the Sun, where sunlight is weaker, NASA has sometimes used Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) to provide power.

It&#x27;s designed to evaluate both your analytical skills in deconstructing a complex skill into its component parts, and your ability to craft an effective method for assessing mastery of those components. Designing a mastery test like this, particularly for something as nuanced as public speaking, involves a few critical steps. Here\u2019s a general outline of how you might approach it:\n\n### 1. Identify Sub-skills of Public Speaking\n\nFirst, break down public speaking into its core sub-skills. These can include, but are not limited to:\n\n- **Content Creation:** Crafting engaging and coherent speeches.\n- **Verbal Communication:** Clarity, pace, tone, and variety in speech.\n- **Non-verbal Communication:** Body language, gestures, facial expressions.\n- **Audience Engagement:** Connecting with the audience, holding attention, and managing feedback.\n- **Anxiety Management:** Techniques for handling public speaking nerves.\n- **Use of Visual Aids:** Effectively incorporating slides, videos, or objects.\n- **Adaptability:** Adjusting the speech on-the-fly based on audience reaction or other factors.\n\n### 2. Choose One Sub-skill for Deep Dive\n\nSelect one of these sub-skills for a more focused analysis. Let\u2019s say you choose **Audience Engagement** as the sub-skill to develop a mastery test for.\n\n### 3. Define Mastery for the Chosen Sub-skill\n\nClarify what mastery looks like for this specific sub-skill. For audience engagement, mastery might involve the speaker&#x27;s ability to:\n\n- Read the room and adjust their delivery accordingly.\n- Ask questions or prompt interactions that keep the audience involved and thinking.\n- Use storytelling or examples that resonate with the audience.\n\n### 4. Design the Mastery Test\n\nDevelop a test that accurately measures a speaker&#x27;s mastery of audience engagement. This could involve:\n\n- **Live Speech Delivery:** The speaker delivers a short presentation to an audience (real or simulated), with specific objectives around audience engagement.\n- **Feedback Mechanism:** Include immediate audience feedback tools, such as live polling or reaction meters, to gauge engagement in real-time.\n- **Reflective Analysis:** Ask the speaker to reflect on their performance, specifically focusing on how they engaged the audience and what they might do differently.\n\n### 5. Criteria for Evaluation\n\nEstablish clear, objective criteria for evaluating the mastery test. This might include:\n\n- **Engagement Metrics:** Utilization of audience feedback tools, time spent with high audience engagement, etc.\n- **Observer Ratings:** Ratings from impartial observers on how effectively the speaker engaged the audience.\n- **Self-assessment:** The speaker&#x27;s own analysis of their performance, particularly their self-identified strengths and areas for improvement in engagement.\n\n### 6. Feedback and Improvement\n\nDesign the assessment so that it provides constructive feedback, allowing individuals to understand their performance and identify specific areas for improvement.\n\nBy following these steps, you create a structured path to not only dissect and understand a complex skill like public speaking but also to measure and improve upon it in a concrete way. This approach encourages deep learning and personal development, which are critical in mastering any skill."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa26782-da39-45a9-9337-f3cdf956b525", "request_id": "8727cd5218990d69-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa26782-da39-45a9-9337-f3cdf956b525", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "f8be1267-95f4-4246-994b-b2a35b5fe8e3", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "cdf15b5d-8d15-497b-871a-aa2e19cd2442", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "cdf15b5d-8d15-497b-871a-aa2e19cd2442"}, {"title": "Download Audio from YouTube", "create_time": 1712799179.247037, "update_time": 1712799388.939711, "mapping": {"ed28693c-dae2-47d4-893f-a188d237533c": {"id": "ed28693c-dae2-47d4-893f-a188d237533c", "message": {"id": "ed28693c-dae2-47d4-893f-a188d237533c", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa1ba07-50ba-46ae-bef1-a13967885263", "children": ["aaa2e551-980f-4858-ae98-df63dccd3c8c"]}, "aaa1ba07-50ba-46ae-bef1-a13967885263": {"id": "aaa1ba07-50ba-46ae-bef1-a13967885263", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["ed28693c-dae2-47d4-893f-a188d237533c"]}, "aaa2e551-980f-4858-ae98-df63dccd3c8c": {"id": "aaa2e551-980f-4858-ae98-df63dccd3c8c", "message": {"id": "aaa2e551-980f-4858-ae98-df63dccd3c8c", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712799179.248402, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["best website to download audio from youtube video?

It\u2019s not a significant thing, but a nice touch nonetheless.\n\nSo, for being 100% free software, we\u2019d say it\u2019s worth your time playing around with, as, from our experience, it\u2019s pretty good.\n\nCheck it out in action:\n\n## 12.

It offers features like four-deck mixing, waveforms, EQ and crossfader controls, effects, and much more. It supports a wide range of DJ controllers right out of the box and allows for extensive customization through MIDI mapping. Mixxx&#x27;s open-source platform means that new features and updates are regularly added by the community.

According to the \u301041\u2020official Virtual DJ statement\u2020www.virtualdj.com\u3011 on their site, you can download and use the Virtual DJ software completely free of charge, provided that you:\n\n  * Don\u2019t use the software for commercial purposes.\n  * Don\u2019t use it with any external DJ controllers / additional DJ equipment.\n\nIf you try and use the free version of Virtual DJ (so basically unlicensed VDJ software) with a DJ controller, the MIDI controls on your device will still work, albeit only for 15 minutes at a time.\n\n[Image 6: A snippet from the official Virtual DJ website regarding the free usage of VDJ software (07.09.22).]A snippet from the official Virtual DJ website regarding the free usage of VDJ software (07.09.22). | Image: \u301041\u2020virtualdj\u2020www.virtualdj.com\u3011\u301041\u2020.com\u2020www.virtualdj.com\u3011\n\nThis makes Virtual DJ a perfect choice for beginners that would like to try out \u301039\u2020laptop-only DJing,\u3011 but makes it inaccessible for free for people already own a DJ controller and want to use it alongside VDJ.\n\n\u301042\u2020Virtual DJ Software \u2013 New Vital Features You Didn\u2019t Know About\u3011\n\nNevertheless, Virtual DJ is among the most popular choices for beginner DJs since over one decade, and for a good reason \u2013 \u301042\u2020its extensive feature set\u3011 can nowadays make even Serato and Rekordbox DJ pale in comparison.\n\nOfficial website: \u301043\u2020https://virtualdj.com/\u2020virtualdj.com\u3011\n\nOur rating: 8/10 \u2013 free without a possibility to use with a DJ controller, or in commercial contexts.\n\n## 3. Serato DJ Lite\n\n[Image 7: Serato DJ Lite is a great starting point if you own a compatible DJ controller, but it&#x27;s really limited in comparison to its Pro version.]Serato DJ Lite is a great starting point if you own a compatible DJ controller, but it\u2019s really limited in comparison to its Pro version. | Image: djgear2k\n\nSerato DJ Lite can be used with just your laptop (without access to many features), or with dedicated Serato DJ Lite controllers (and quite frankly even then it\u2019s very limited in comparison to Serato DJ Pro).\n\nWith Serato DJ Lite and without a DJ controller, you are able to use the basic functionality of the software. You have access to the track waveform view, library view, track management and transport controls, a crossfader, tempo controls, hot cues and loops.\n\n\u301044\u2020Serato DJ Lite vs. Pro (12 Most Important Differences)\u3011\n\nIf you do have a Serato DJ Lite compatible controller, you can basically use the very same features and some more (like audio FX) with an aid of physical controls.\n\nAlthough this doesn\u2019t sound half bad, the limitations of Serato DJ Lite software are vast. One example is, in Serato DJ Lite you are not able to utilize audio loops smaller than 1 beat or larger than 8 beats. Every other DJ software on the market, including Serato DJ Pro let you do that.\n\nTo sum it up perfectly, it is free, but is sure is extremely limited in \u301044\u2020comparison to the \u201cfull\u201d version of Seratto DJ software \u2013 Serato DJ Pro.\u3011\n\nOfficial website: \u301045\u2020https://serato.com/dj/lite\u2020serato.com\u3011\n\nOur rating: 6/10 \u2013 really limited but can get the job done.\n\n## 4. DJUCED\n\n[Image 8: DJUCED DJ software can be used to the fullest only with a dedicated Hercules DJ controller.]DJUCED DJ software can be used to the fullest only with a dedicated Hercules DJ controller. | Image: \u301046\u2020djuced.com\u2020www.djuced.com\u3011\n\nDJUCED is aimed at beginners, but fully capable of aiding DJs of every level of expertise. This one is designed to be compatible with just Hercules DJ brand controllers, but to a certain degree in can function in the so-called \u201coffline mode\u201d.\n\nWhen downloaded and started up without a compatible DJ controller connected, DJUCED software gives you access to the offline mode with music library management section and limited mixing features. Keep in mind that offline mode features are meant to be used for mix preparation, rather than for an actual live performance.\n\nThe DJUCED software also features an extensive knowledge base and manual section on their website which can be really helpful if you\u2019re just starting out.\n\nOfficial website: \u301047\u2020https://www.djuced.com/\u2020www.djuced.com\u3011\n\nOur rating: 5/10 \u2013 great support for Hercules DJ controllers, very limited without a compatible DJ controller plugged in.\n\n## 5.

This piece of software much like the others, gives you access to basic mixing controls and library management tools.\n\nThe software works really well and overall it\u2019s sufficient for simple mixing, synchronizing your tracks and preparing basic transitions.\n\nAs expected, there are a few things available as additional purchases here, such as additional audio FX, MIDI device support or more advanced mix controls. These features are acquired by buying bonus \u201clevel up\u201d upgrades directly on the youdj site.\n\nMoreover, it has a no-install version available on the youdj website, more about it down below.\n\nOfficial website: \u301051\u2020https://you.dj/free-dj-software\u2020you.dj\u3011\n\nOur rating: 5/10 \u2013 overall nicely done, functional and has a free variant (available also in the form of a web app).\n\n## Can you DJ for free online?\n\n[Image 12: The online YouDJ web app"}]}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2f44a-f2a0-460f-805f-c20c397a4b83", "children": ["aaa29396-a29d-4cfc-b3a1-822cef5dd0a0"]}, "aaa29396-a29d-4cfc-b3a1-822cef5dd0a0": {"id": "aaa29396-a29d-4cfc-b3a1-822cef5dd0a0", "message": {"id": "aaa29396-a29d-4cfc-b3a1-822cef5dd0a0", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712796932.243431, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I only have the laptop and a mouse and microphone headset, does that info effect your recommendation?

Virtual DJ&#x27;s interface and functionalities are designed to be easily navigable with a mouse, and its advanced features such as real-time music separation, video mixing, and streaming integration can significantly enhance your DJing experience even without additional hardware.\n\nVirtual DJ also supports microphone use, allowing you to talk to your audience during your sets, which aligns well with your current setup. The limitation regarding external controllers in the free version of Virtual DJ wouldn&#x27;t affect you since you&#x27;re currently operating with just a laptop and a mouse. This setup will enable you to explore and utilize Virtual DJ&#x27;s capabilities fully without the need for additional investments in hardware.\n\nHowever, it&#x27;s worth noting that **Mixxx** also supports microphone input and could be a viable option, especially if you&#x27;re interested in an open-source solution with a strong community behind it. Mixxx&#x27;s comprehensive feature set also supports laptop-only DJing, offering flexibility and customization through software.\n\nUltimately, the choice between Virtual DJ and Mixxx might come down to personal preference regarding the interface and specific features.

Avoid overly casual or inappropriate email handles.\r\n\r\nAlways triple-check your contact information for accuracy. A single typo in your phone number or email address could cost you the opportunity.\r\n\r\nEmphasize achievements over responsibilities when possible. Hiring managers are more interested in how you excelled in your role and contributed to the company&#x27;s success.\r\n\r\nGood Example: Consistently exceeded quarterly sales targets by an average of 18% for 7 consecutive quarters.\r\n\r\nBad Example: Responsible for generating leads through cold calling.\r\n\r\nInclude only work experience that is relevant to the position you are applying for. If you&#x27;re applying for a role in marketing, your previous experience in finance may not be pertinent.\r\nIf you are a recent graduate with limited work experience, highlight other relevant experiences such as internships, volunteer work, and personal projects. If you lack these experiences, proactively seek out opportunities to gain skills and experiences that will be valuable for your desired career path.\r\nEven seemingly unrelated work experience, such as a part-time job in retail while pursuing a degree in software engineering, can demonstrate a strong work ethic and transferable skills.\r\n\r\nQuantify your experiences and achievements with specific data and metrics whenever possible. This helps you stand out from other candidates and showcases your impact in previous roles.\r\nDO: Optimized the company&#x27;s Google Ads account, increasing the click-through rate (CTR) from 2.1% to 4.7% and reducing the cost per acquisition (CPA) by 32%.\r\n\r\nDON&#x27;T: Managed the company&#x27;s Google Ads account.\r\n\r\nIf you are transitioning to a new career, address this in your resume summary. For example:\r\n&quot;Experienced sales professional with 6+ years in the industry seeking to transition into a role as a data analyst. Completed a data science certification program and worked on several freelance data analysis projects for small businesses.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates that you are intentionally pursuing a career change and highlights any relevant experience or training you have in the new field.\r\n\r\nAvoid the &quot;spray and pray&quot; approach of applying to dozens of jobs per day with a generic resume. Instead, focus on carefully selecting a handful of well-suited positions and tailoring your application to each one.\r\nTo effectively tailor your resume, thoroughly review the job description and identify the key skills and responsibilities required for the role. Ensure that your resume highlights your relevant skills and experiences, even if they weren&#x27;t the primary focus of your previous positions.\r\nKeep your resume concise and limit it to one page, unless you have extensive relevant experience spanning more than 15 years. Focus on the most important and relevant information for the position you are applying for.\r\nAvoid using generic buzzwords and phrases like &quot;detail-oriented,&quot; &quot;team player,&quot; or &quot;excellent communication skills.&quot; Instead, provide specific examples that demonstrate these qualities through your achievements and experiences.\r\nUnless specifically requested or culturally expected in your country, do not include a photo on your resume.\r\nConsider using a tool like MailTrack to monitor when your resume is opened by a recruiter. This can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your application and help you determine when to follow up.\r\nIf you have completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, it is generally unnecessary to include information about your high school education.\r\nAlways proofread your resume for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors. Utilize tools like Grammarly or ask a trusted friend or family member to review it for you.\r\nA hobbies and interests section can be included if you have extra space and no additional relevant experience to highlight.

In Google Docs, you can go to `File` &gt; `Open` &gt; `Upload` to open the HTML file directly.\n   - Adjust the document settings (margins, font size, etc.) to fit the content onto one page.\n   - Save or export the document as a PDF.\n\nFor the content to fit nicely on one page, you might need to:\n- Reduce the margins to 0.5 inches on all sides.\n- Use a slightly smaller font size for less critical sections if necessary.\n- Ensure there are no large spaces or breaks that could push content to the second page.\n\nIf you&#x27;re looking for a more automated solution or if you encounter any difficulties with these steps, there are online HTML to PDF converters that can also help adjust the layout to fit a single page. \n\nWould you need further assistance on this or any other requests?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-FIhD2bkA1", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "aaa246a3-ab80-4806-aab4-ea6ea5d1e0a5", "request_id": "87269f461ff574ea-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa246a3-ab80-4806-aab4-ea6ea5d1e0a5", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "e21ddcc2-6bdb-43d5-a387-3a69adc48c39", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "29d9e917-4520-4ef4-bbf2-6be8c813c84b", "conversation_template_id": "g-FIhD2bkA1", "gizmo_id": "g-FIhD2bkA1", "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": ["https://resume-pdf-gpt.vercel.app/resume/cards/v1-RedRLUvEbI", "https://resume-pdf-gpt.vercel.app/kirill-resume-(detailed", "https://ig6abhjhn2fretux.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/cards-v1-RedRLUvEbI-QpJuefs42ebbZqGmkDB1PgFAN446Bh.pdf", "https://resume-pdf-gpt.vercel.app/kirill-resume-(simple", "https://ig6abhjhn2fretux.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/cards-v1-RedRLUvEbI-gG5b4zirPcONzByXV8ozpj9HgfyTmP.png", "https://github.com/bra1ndump", "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12608159?v=4", "https://resume-pdf-gpt.vercel.app/kirill-resume-example.png"], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "29d9e917-4520-4ef4-bbf2-6be8c813c84b"}, {"title": "Improve Korean Pronunciation: Techniques", "create_time": 1712579606.394799, "update_time": 1712579765.75135, "mapping": {"5368a947-ea5c-435a-8f98-0e38a472d0b6": {"id": "5368a947-ea5c-435a-8f98-0e38a472d0b6", "message": {"id": "5368a947-ea5c-435a-8f98-0e38a472d0b6", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa1510b-908d-41ba-8b78-4175c7703fa7", "children": ["aaa21dc7-3dae-44ec-8695-0a54165ab3df"]}, "aaa1510b-908d-41ba-8b78-4175c7703fa7": {"id": "aaa1510b-908d-41ba-8b78-4175c7703fa7", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["5368a947-ea5c-435a-8f98-0e38a472d0b6"]}, "aaa21dc7-3dae-44ec-8695-0a54165ab3df": {"id": "aaa21dc7-3dae-44ec-8695-0a54165ab3df", "message": {"id": "aaa21dc7-3dae-44ec-8695-0a54165ab3df", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712579606.396004, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["what&#x27;s the best way to help a native Korean speaker with pronunciation in English who has difficulty saying words like frenchfries"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "871249296e63526a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5368a947-ea5c-435a-8f98-0e38a472d0b6", "children": ["fb4e4493-4d30-4d55-a57b-d4a73a0b1482"]}, "fb4e4493-4d30-4d55-a57b-d4a73a0b1482": {"id": "fb4e4493-4d30-4d55-a57b-d4a73a0b1482", "message": {"id": "fb4e4493-4d30-4d55-a57b-d4a73a0b1482", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712579660.146383, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Helping a native Korean speaker improve their pronunciation in English, especially for words like &quot;french fries&quot; that involve sounds not present in Korean, requires a multifaceted approach. Here are several strategies:\n\n1. **Phonemic Awareness**: Focus on individual sounds that are challenging, such as the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds in &quot;french fries&quot;. Korean doesn&#x27;t have these exact sounds, so it&#x27;s crucial to start with isolation exercises. Use minimal pairs (words that only have a one-sound difference) to train the ear and mouth, like &quot;fan&quot; vs &quot;van&quot; for the &quot;f&quot; sound.\n\n2. **Mouth Position and Movement**: Show how to position the lips, tongue, and jaw for tricky sounds. The &quot;f&quot; sound, for example, is made by lightly biting the lower lip with the upper teeth and blowing air out. The &quot;r&quot; sound in English is unique, and showing the tongue placement and movement can help. Use a mirror or video to provide visual feedback.\n\n3. **Listening and Imitation**: Listening to native speakers and trying to imitate their pronunciation can be incredibly helpful. Use videos, songs, or podcasts. Slow down the audio if possible so they can catch the nuances of the pronunciation.\n\n4. **Tongue Twisters and Practice Sentences**: Use tongue twisters and sentences that incorporate challenging sounds multiple times. This not only practices the sound but also improves fluency in connecting sounds together.\n\n5. **Recording and Feedback**: Encourage recording their own pronunciation. This allows for self-assessment and for you to provide specific feedback. Sometimes, what we think we sound like and what we actually sound like can be quite different.\n\n6. **Linking Sounds and Rhythms**: English has a rhythm that can affect pronunciation. Work on linking sounds and the natural rhythm of English sentences, as this can change the pronunciation and stress patterns of words within a sentence.\n\n7. **Consistent Practice and Patience**: Pronunciation improvement is a slow process that requires regular practice and patience. Encourage consistency and celebrate small improvements to maintain motivation.\n\n8. **Engage with Native Speakers**: If possible, conversing with native English speakers can provide real-life practice and feedback. This can be done through language exchange meetups or online platforms.\n\n9. **Use Technology**: Apps and online resources specifically designed for pronunciation can provide structured practice and feedback. Look for ones that use speech recognition technology to give immediate feedback.\n\n10. **Understand Phonetic Transcription**: Learning the basics of phonetic transcription, especially the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), can help understand how sounds are produced in a more technical way.\n\nRemember, the goal is clear communication, not perfection. Encouraging confidence and a positive attitude towards learning will also go a long way in improving pronunciation."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa21dc7-3dae-44ec-8695-0a54165ab3df", "request_id": "871249296e63526a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa21dc7-3dae-44ec-8695-0a54165ab3df", "children": ["aaa2ff05-cb6b-44d4-ba41-def79f17ec0d"]}, "aaa2ff05-cb6b-44d4-ba41-def79f17ec0d": {"id": "aaa2ff05-cb6b-44d4-ba41-def79f17ec0d", "message": {"id": "aaa2ff05-cb6b-44d4-ba41-def79f17ec0d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712579709.12477, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["okay, could you rewrite that as towards the student on how they can improve themselves but keep the same info"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87124baa0cbd526a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fb4e4493-4d30-4d55-a57b-d4a73a0b1482", "children": ["f5434fb6-b208-44ef-8c52-7b90615ba821"]}, "f5434fb6-b208-44ef-8c52-7b90615ba821": {"id": "f5434fb6-b208-44ef-8c52-7b90615ba821", "message": {"id": "f5434fb6-b208-44ef-8c52-7b90615ba821", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712579765.40555, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Certainly! Here&#x27;s how you can improve your English pronunciation, especially for tricky words like &quot;french fries&quot;:\n\n1. **Start with Sounds**: Focus on the individual sounds that are giving you trouble. For &quot;french fries&quot;, the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds might be new to you. Practice these sounds on their own first, using pairs of words that differ by just one sound, like &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;van&quot; for the &quot;f&quot; sound. This will help train both your ears and your mouth.\n\n2. **Learn the Right Mouth Moves**: Pay attention to how to position your lips, tongue, and jaw for these sounds. For the &quot;f&quot; sound, you&#x27;ll need to bite your lower lip lightly with your upper teeth and blow air out. For the &quot;r&quot; sound, notice how the tongue is positioned and moves. Use a mirror or record videos of yourself to make sure you&#x27;re doing it right.\n\n3. **Listen and Repeat**: Try listening to how native speakers say these words and phrases. You can find videos, songs, or podcasts online. If you can, slow the audio down to catch all the details, and then mimic what you hear.\n\n4. **Tongue Twisters and Practice Sentences**: Practice with tongue twisters and sentences that have lots of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds. This will help you get used to saying these sounds in different words and improve your fluency.\n\n5. **Record Yourself**: It&#x27;s really helpful to record your own pronunciation. You can listen back to see how close you are to the sounds you&#x27;re aiming for, and it&#x27;s a great way to track your progress over time.\n\n6. **Learn the Rhythm**: English has its own rhythm, and the way sounds connect can change how words are pronounced. Practice the natural flow of sentences to improve how naturally your pronunciation sounds.\n\n7. **Keep at It**: Improving your pronunciation takes time and regular practice. Try to stay consistent and be patient with yourself. Celebrate your improvements, no matter how small they might seem!\n\n8. **Talk with Native Speakers**: If you can, practice speaking with native English speakers. They can offer you real-life practice and feedback. You might find language exchange groups online or in person.\n\n9. **Use Helpful Apps and Online Resources**: There are lots of tools out there designed to help with pronunciation. Look for ones that use speech recognition to give you instant feedback on how you&#x27;re doing.\n\n10. **Get to Know Phonetic Transcription**: Learning a bit about phonetic transcription, like the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), can give you a clearer idea of how to make specific sounds.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to communicate clearly, not to sound perfect.

The aim to focus on real-life applications of traditional subjects ensures that students acquire not only knowledge but also practical skills they can apply in everyday situations. Here&#x27;s how you can structure these curriculums:\n\n### Curriculum for Parents (Home-School Educators)\nThis curriculum is designed to empower parents with the tools and knowledge to facilitate their children&#x27;s learning effectively. It will include:\n\n1. **Educational Theories and Child Development**: Brief modules on how children learn at different stages, including cognitive development from ages 5 to 18. This foundation will help parents understand the &quot;why&quot; behind the curriculum activities and adapt teaching strategies to their child&#x27;s learning style.\n\n2. **Subject-Specific Teaching Strategies**:\n   - For each subject (social studies, math, science, literature, and communication), provide an overview of teaching methodologies that encourage hands-on learning and real-life application.\n   - Include tips for creating an engaging learning environment at home, fostering curiosity, and encouraging independent learning.\n\n3. **Real-Life Application of Knowledge**: Practical sessions on how to integrate knowledge with everyday life. For example, using grocery shopping as a math lesson (budgeting, calculating discounts, etc.), or a nature walk as a science lesson (identifying plants, understanding ecosystems).\n\n4. **Assessment and Feedback**: How to assess learning not just through tests, but through projects, presentations, and practical tasks. Guidance on giving constructive feedback to encourage growth.\n\n5. **Customization and Adaptation**: Tools and tips for customizing the curriculum based on the child&#x27;s interests, strengths, and areas for improvement. This section would include resources for additional learning materials and how to access them.\n\n### Curriculum for Students (Ages 5-18)\nThe student curriculum will be modular, allowing for customization based on age, interest, and skill level, focusing on functional skills and real-life applications.\n\n1. **Social Studies**: Projects and activities that involve local community engagement, understanding cultural diversity, and the practical aspects of government and economics (e.g., budget planning for a community project).\n\n2. **Math**: Math lessons focused on financial literacy (savings, budgeting, understanding interest), geometry through architecture (building a model, calculating areas), and statistics through sports or other interests.\n\n3. **Science**: Experiments and projects that solve real-world problems (e.g., designing a simple water filtration system), understanding health and nutrition through biology, and environmental conservation projects.\n\n4. **Literature**: Reading assignments that include a variety of genres, with activities aimed at critical thinking and applying lessons learned to personal experiences. Creative writing assignments that encourage students to express their thoughts and views on contemporary issues.\n\n5. **Communication**: Activities that enhance verbal and non-verbal communication, including public speaking, debate on current events, and digital literacy skills like internet research and digital content creation.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n- **Flexibility**: Both curriculums should emphasize adaptability, allowing educators and students to modify content based on learning pace, interests, and the relevance of topics.\n- **Interconnectivity**: Activities in the students&#x27; curriculum should link back to concepts covered in the parents&#x27; curriculum, ensuring a cohesive learning experience.\n- **Resources and Support**: Provide a comprehensive list of resources, including online platforms, books, and community resources, to enhance learning. Also, consider setting up a support system or forum for parents to share experiences and advice.\n\nThis dual curriculum approach not only enriches the educational experience for students but also equips parents with the confidence and resources to be effective educators."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": "g-zaEzov912", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa22cf6-27fd-4e4d-962c-2ea130d28a3b", "request_id": "86fc9bd2a95977fa-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa22cf6-27fd-4e4d-962c-2ea130d28a3b", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "2eaa19e5-7099-497e-98bf-2f20d932debe", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "240a5b97-1204-4ad3-888d-a8894e0d7dc3", "conversation_template_id": "g-zaEzov912", "gizmo_id": "g-zaEzov912", "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4-gizmo", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "240a5b97-1204-4ad3-888d-a8894e0d7dc3"}, {"title": "Homeschool Course Recruitment.", "create_time": 1711951558.772142, "update_time": 1712256029.331152, "mapping": {"27f03835-bbc2-45e5-bba7-ab18d0e60a6a": {"id": "27f03835-bbc2-45e5-bba7-ab18d0e60a6a", "message": {"id": "27f03835-bbc2-45e5-bba7-ab18d0e60a6a", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8c3ef28a-33ed-4bb4-9d6d-05f08a35c31b", "children": ["fa126ac3-295b-4e0d-a21c-f72c40790f54"]}, "8c3ef28a-33ed-4bb4-9d6d-05f08a35c31b": {"id": "8c3ef28a-33ed-4bb4-9d6d-05f08a35c31b", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["27f03835-bbc2-45e5-bba7-ab18d0e60a6a"]}, "fa126ac3-295b-4e0d-a21c-f72c40790f54": {"id": "fa126ac3-295b-4e0d-a21c-f72c40790f54", "message": {"id": "fa126ac3-295b-4e0d-a21c-f72c40790f54", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [], "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "27f03835-bbc2-45e5-bba7-ab18d0e60a6a", "children": ["7be7530b-0a3a-4e1f-ab4d-7da536f0bc26"]}, "7be7530b-0a3a-4e1f-ab4d-7da536f0bc26": {"id": "7be7530b-0a3a-4e1f-ab4d-7da536f0bc26", "message": {"id": "7be7530b-0a3a-4e1f-ab4d-7da536f0bc26", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1711951558.773067, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Create powerpoint presentation to recruit a trsching professional to lead this project highlighting its need purpose, possible accomplishments, impact and viability.

Talk about the market and the likely customer of the project described below\n\nCreating a course that serves as an electronic textbook for homeschooling parents, especially those who might not have formal training in education, is a brilliant idea. The increasing trend towards homeschooling, combined with the diverse reasons parents choose to homeschool, presents a significant opportunity for such a resource. Many parents are looking for comprehensive, structured guidance that aligns with current educational standards and incorporates the latest in pedagogical research.Your course could fill a critical gap by providing parents with:Structured Curriculum: Outline what needs to be taught at each grade level, making sure it&#x27;s in line with current educational standards and research. This will help parents ensure they are covering necessary material.Teaching Materials: Offer ready-to-use materials that parents can employ directly in their teaching. This could include worksheets, interactive activities, and multimedia resources.Instructional Guides: Provide instructions on how to teach various concepts, which is particularly valuable for parents without a background in education. This might include strategies for engaging children, explaining complex ideas, and adapting teaching to different learning styles.Assessments and Exercises: Include exercises, quizzes, and projects to assess children&#x27;s understanding and retention of the material. Providing answer keys and grading rubrics can also help parents gauge their child\u2019s progress.Support and Community: Building a community feature into your course could provide immense value, allowing parents to share experiences, challenges, and solutions. Additionally, offering some level of direct support, whether through Q&amp;A sessions, forums, or scheduled consultations, could be a major selling point.The key to success with this type of course will be in making it as accessible and user-friendly as possible. Consider the varying levels of comfort with technology and teaching that your audience might have. Breaking down the curriculum into manageable, bite-sized pieces can make the process less daunting for parents. Moreover, focusing on interactive and practical learning activities can make education a more engaging and enjoyable experience for both the parent and the child.Given the homeschooling market&#x27;s projected growth and the clear demand for resources that support personalized, home-based learning, a course like the one you&#x27;re considering could meet an essential need. By helping parents feel more equipped and confident in providing their children with a quality education, you&#x27;d not only be offering a valuable product but also contributing positively to the homeschooling community.\nGPT\nTalked to chatgpt-plugin.canva.com\nI&#x27;ve created two PowerPoint presentation options for you to pitch your homeschooling electronic textbook course.

The `crosswordData` array defines the words, their starting positions, directions (across or down), and clues. The script then generates the crossword grid dynamically, placing input fields for letters in appropriate cells.\n\nEach input field is set up to only accept a single character, and the character is validated against the correct letter for that position.

Let&#x27;s diagnose and propose a solution to ensure that the crossword puzzle renders correctly on the webpage:\n\n1. **JavaScript Execution Timing**: Ensure the script runs after the HTML elements it references are loaded. In your case, the script directly manipulates the DOM, so it&#x27;s crucial that the `&lt;div id=&quot;crossword&quot; class=&quot;crossword-container&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` element is already parsed and available in the DOM.\n\n2. **Visibility of Input Fields**: The `.hidden` class sets the visibility to hidden for cells without letters. This is correct, but ensure that input fields for the crossword letters do not receive this class by mistake when they should display.\n\n3. **Correct Letters Assignment**: Each input field is assigned a `dataset.correct` value based on your grid. Ensure this data attribute is being set correctly for each cell that is part of a word.\n\nGiven the code snippet you provided seems logically structured and should, in theory, render the puzzle correctly, I suspect the issue might lie in how the browser is executing the JavaScript in relation to the page&#x27;s load state or perhaps a subtle oversight in how data attributes are applied or interpreted. Here&#x27;s a slightly modified approach to ensure that your script executes only after the DOM is fully loaded:\n\nWrap your script in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to ensure it runs after the HTML document has been fully loaded:\n\n```html\n&lt;script&gt;\n    document.addEventListener(&#x27;DOMContentLoaded&#x27;, function() {\n        const crosswordData = [\n            {word: &quot;SCHERZO&quot;, start: {x: 0, y: 0}, direction: &quot;across&quot;, clue: &quot;1.

This version aims to display something on the screen without the complexities of checking for correct answers. It helps in diagnosing if the problem lies within the dynamic generation of the grid or elsewhere.\n\nIf this simplified version still doesn&#x27;t display the crossword grid, check the browser&#x27;s console for errors. These errors can provide clues on what might be going wrong. Common issues include syntax errors, issues with browser compatibility, or problems with the JavaScript execution environment.\n\nIf the simplified version works, it means the structure of your HTML and basic JavaScript are functioning correctly. The issue might then be related to the logic for dynamically generating the grid based on the `crosswordData` or handling user inputs. You can then incrementally add back the more complex features, testing at each step to see where the problem might re-emerge."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "citations": [], "gizmo_id": null, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa22732-6178-4609-a38d-15fbf0847a91", "request_id": "86e0c2131a70a25f-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa22732-6178-4609-a38d-15fbf0847a91", "children": ["aaa29733-6ec6-44ee-b3f7-4cab6855e7d8"]}, "aaa29733-6ec6-44ee-b3f7-4cab6855e7d8": {"id": "aaa29733-6ec6-44ee-b3f7-4cab6855e7d8", "message": {"id": "aaa29733-6ec6-44ee-b3f7-4cab6855e7d8", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1712060419.36276, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["nope, this is all that rendered: \nPractice Italian B1 - April Fools&#x27;

If the grid still doesn&#x27;t display as expected, there may be external factors at play, such as browser compatibility issues or external CSS/JavaScript that might be affecting the rendering. Ensure you&#x27;re testing this in a clean HTML file without any external dependencies for the most accurate troubleshooting."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0,

Use video editing software to assemble all these elements into a final video.\n\nI can provide a written script or describe the transitions and effects in more detail, but the actual video creation would need to be done with video editing software on your end.
