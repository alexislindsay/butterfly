This website seems to offer content and possible also services in this area. Please make sure you are not investing in a scam. Check our article on \u301031\u2020How to check if a forex or investment site is legit or a scam?\u3011.\n\nThis website, which appears to provide banking, money lending, stock trading, and other financial services, is hosted on a shared server. An attacker might use one compromised website on the same server as a portal to all other websites on the same server if you employ a shared server for such data-sensitive services. We advise you to think twice about using this website&#x27;s services because the personal information you enter on it, and consequently, your device, could be hacked.\n\n### Webshop Review\n\nThe Tranco ranking of this website is low. This can be considered low in relation to other websites from the website&#x27;s country. If you think this website should be very popular, please invest additional time in researching the company as this is suspicious. For a smaller or starting website a low ranking can be considered normal.\n\nMost companies claim the name of their website (aka domain name) for only one year in advance. they can automatically renew the registration each year. We consider it a positive sign if a domain name is registered for more than one year in the future. It means that the company intends to do business for a long time. We increased the Trust Score of futurenest.com as a result.\n\nThe domain name of this website has been registered several years ago. In general, the older the website the more trustworthy it becomes. However, scammers sometimes buy existing websites and start doing their evil thing, so please make sure you check for other scammy attributes as well.\u00a0\n\n### \n\nTechnical Review\n\nWe identified an SSL certificate meaning that the data shared between your browser and the website is encrypted and cannot be read by others. SSL certificates are always used by legit and safe websites. Unfortunately scammers increasingly also use SSL certificates so it is no guarantee that you are visiting a reliable website.\n\n##  Facts about futurenest.com\n\nKey facts \n\nDomain age\n\n24 years from now\n\nWHOIS data\n\nhidden\n\nWebsite data \n\nWebsite\n\nfuturenest.com\n\nRedirecting from website\n\nfuturenest.com\n\nTitle\n\nHome | FutureNest, Inc.\n\nDomain age\n\n24 years from now\n\nWebsite Speed\n\nSlow\n\nSSL certificate valid\n\nvalid\n\nSSL type\n\nLow - Domain Validated Certificates (DV SSL)\n\nSSL issuer\n\nLet&#x27;s Encrypt\n\nWHOIS registration date\n\n 10:32:56\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n\u301033\u2020 How to Recognize a Scam Website \u3011 \n\nAs the influence of the internet rises, so does the prevalence of online scams. There are fraudsters making all kinds of claims to trap victims online - from fake investment opportunities to online stores - and the internet allows them to operate from any part of the world with anonymity. The ability to spot online scams is an important skill to have as the virtual world is increasingly becoming a part of every facet of our lives. The below tips will help you identify the signs which can indicate that a website could be a scam. Common Sense: Too Good To Be True When looking for goods online, a great deal can be very enticing. A Gucci bag or a new iPhone for half the price? Who wouldn\u2019t want to grab such a deal? Scammers know this too and try to take advantage of the fact. If an online deal looks too good to be true, think twice and double-check things. The easiest way to do this is to simply check out the same product at competing websites (that you trust). If the difference in prices is huge, it might be better to double-check the rest of the website. Check Out the Social Media Links Social media is a core part of ecommerce businesses these days and consumers often expect online shops to have a social media presence.

This website seems to offer content and possible also services in this area. Please make sure you are not investing in a scam. Check our article on \u301031\u2020How to check if a forex or investment site is legit or a scam?\u3011.\n\nThis website, which appears to provide banking, money lending, stock trading, and other financial services, is hosted on a shared server. An attacker might use one compromised website on the same server as a portal to all other websites on the same server if you employ a shared server for such data-sensitive services. We advise you to think twice about using this website&#x27;s services because the personal information you enter on it, and consequently, your device, could be hacked.\n\n### Webshop Review\n\nThe Tranco ranking of this website is low. This can be considered low in relation to other websites from the website&#x27;s country. If you think this website should be very popular, please invest additional time in researching the company as this is suspicious. For a smaller or starting website a low ranking can be considered normal.\n\nMost companies claim the name of their website (aka domain name) for only one year in advance. they can automatically renew the registration each year. We consider it a positive sign if a domain name is registered for more than one year in the future. It means that the company intends to do business for a long time. We increased the Trust Score of futurenest.com as a result.\n\nThe domain name of this website has been registered several years ago. In general, the older the website the more trustworthy it becomes. However, scammers sometimes buy existing websites and start doing their evil thing, so please make sure you check for other scammy attributes as well.\u00a0\n\n### \n\nTechnical Review\n\nWe identified an SSL certificate meaning that the data shared between your browser and the website is encrypted and cannot be read by others. SSL certificates are always used by legit and safe websites. Unfortunately scammers increasingly also use SSL certificates so it is no guarantee that you are visiting a reliable website.\n\n##  Facts about futurenest.com\n\nKey facts \n\nDomain age\n\n24 years from now\n\nWHOIS data\n\nhidden\n\nWebsite data \n\nWebsite\n\nfuturenest.com\n\nRedirecting from website\n\nfuturenest.com\n\nTitle\n\nHome | FutureNest, Inc.\n\nDomain age\n\n24 years from now\n\nWebsite Speed\n\nSlow\n\nSSL certificate valid\n\nvalid\n\nSSL type\n\nLow - Domain Validated Certificates (DV SSL)\n\nSSL issuer\n\nLet&#x27;s Encrypt\n\nWHOIS registration date\n\n 10:32:56\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n\u301033\u2020 How to Recognize a Scam Website \u3011 \n\nAs the influence of the internet rises, so does the prevalence of online scams.

The below tips will help you identify the signs which can indicate that a website could be a scam. Common Sense: Too Good To Be True When looking for goods online, a great deal can be very enticing. A Gucci bag or a new iPhone for half the price? Who wouldn\u2019t want to grab such a deal? Scammers know this too and try to take advantage of the fact. If an online deal looks too good to be true, think twice and double-check things. The easiest way to do this is to simply check out the same product at competing websites (that you trust). If the difference in prices is huge, it might be better to double-check the rest of the website. Check Out the Social Media Links Social media is a core part of ecommerce businesses these days and consumers often expect online shops to have a social media presence. Scammers know this and often insert logos of social media sites on their websites. Scratching beneath the surface often reveals this fu \n\n\u301033\u2020 Read more \u3011 \n\n\u301034\u2020 How Do I Get Money Back From a Scammer? \u3011 \n\nSo the worst has come to pass - you realise you parted with your money too fast, and the site you used was a scam - what now? Well first of all, don\u2019t despair!! If you think you have been scammed, the first port of call when having an issue is to simply ask for a refund. This is the first and easiest step to determine whether you are dealing with a genuine company or scammers. Sadly, getting your money back from a scammer is not as simple as just asking.\u00a0 If you are indeed dealing with scammers, the procedure (and chance) of getting your money back varies depending on the payment method you used. PayPal Debit card/Credit card Bank transfer Wire transfer Google Pay Bitcoin PayPal If you used PayPal, you have a strong chance of getting your money back if you were scammed. On their website, you can file a dispute within 180 calendar days of your purchase. Conditions to file a dispute: The simplest situation is that you ordered from an online store and it has not arrived. In this case this is what PayPal states: &quot;If your order never shows up and the seller can&#x27;t provide proof of shipment or delivery, you&#x27;ll get a full refund. It&#x27;s that simple.&quot; The scammer has sent you a completely different item. For example, you ordered a PlayStation 4, but instead received only a Playstation controller.\u00a0 The condition of the item was misrepresented on the product page.

There are a few approaches to doing this:\n\n### 1. **Referral Programs for Recruiting**\n   Many companies use referral programs to encourage employees or external partners to recommend potential candidates for job openings. These referrals are incentivized by providing rewards, either as cash bonuses, gift cards, or other benefits, once the referred candidate gets hired and completes a probation period. This structure is quite similar to affiliate marketing, as referrers earn commissions for successful &quot;conversions.&quot;\n\n### 2. **Affiliate Recruiting Networks**\n   Some platforms work like affiliate marketing networks but specifically focus on recruiting. These platforms allow people to become &quot;affiliates&quot; by promoting job listings or career opportunities for specific companies. If a candidate applies and gets hired via the affiliate\u2019s referral link, the affiliate earns a commission. Examples of such platforms include:\n   - **Indeed** and **Glassdoor** sometimes allow partner integrations, where traffic or candidates referred from certain partners generate commissions.\n   - **JobTarget** offers a service to distribute job postings across multiple job boards and uses a commission model to encourage partnerships.\n  \n### 3. **Social Recruiting with Affiliate Strategies**\n   Similar to influencer marketing, recruiters or employers can partner with social media influencers who promote job openings to their audience. These influencers may earn a commission or flat fee for each successful candidate they refer. This is especially effective in niche industries where certain influencers have a relevant audience (e.g., tech, creative fields).\n\n### 4. **Platform-Based Recruiting Referral Programs**\n   Platforms like **Workable** and **SmartRecruiters** offer built-in tools for referral recruiting. Companies can share job postings with employees, who in turn can share them with their networks, and receive rewards if those contacts are hired. This turns every employee into an affiliate-like recruiter.\n\n### 5. **Recruitment Marketing Agencies**\n   Agencies that specialize in recruitment marketing can also operate on a performance-based model, similar to affiliate marketing. They help drive candidate applications to employers, and they are paid based on metrics such as the number of successful hires.\n\n### 6. **Freelance Recruiter Platforms**\n   Platforms like **Hiretual** and **Recruitifi** allow freelance recruiters to submit candidates to companies\u2019 open positions. Freelance recruiters are paid when their candidates are successfully hired, which is similar to an affiliate commission model.\n\n### 7. **Utilizing Affiliate Networks for Job Listings**\n   Some affiliate marketing networks, like **CJ Affiliate** or **ShareASale**, may include programs related to education or career services. Affiliates in this scenario could earn commissions by promoting educational courses or certifications that lead to employment opportunities, thus indirectly participating in the recruitment process.\n\nIf you&#x27;re interested in starting something like this, consider partnering with companies that have open affiliate programs in the recruitment space or creating your own referral network targeting specific niches or industries."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "parent_id": "aaa2285b-2291-40f6-b5d6-9e92eadba68f", "request_id": "8db6e6b3bafa0e1b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2285b-2291-40f6-b5d6-9e92eadba68f", "children": ["aaa262e9-634e-41ae-97f6-da3ca34cee0d"]}, "aaa262e9-634e-41ae-97f6-da3ca34cee0d": {"id": "aaa262e9-634e-41ae-97f6-da3ca34cee0d", "message": {"id": "aaa262e9-634e-41ae-97f6-da3ca34cee0d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1730476465.287415, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "multimodal_text", "parts": [{"content_type": "image_asset_pointer", "asset_pointer": "file-service://file-dGUawUpQrqOVME3h2I2pQDye", "size_bytes": 4820153, "width": 2048, "height": 1447, "fovea": null, "metadata": {"dalle": null, "gizmo": null, "emu_omit_glimpse_image": null, "emu_patches_override": null, "sanitized": true}}, "OH, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY BRAND/LOGO?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-dGUawUpQrqOVME3h2I2pQDye", "size": 4820153, "name": "Copy of Pink Yellow Minimalist Manifest and Attract Planner A4 Document (A2 (Landscape)).png", "mime_type": "image/png", "width": 2048, "height": 1447}], "serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8dbd1028d8a05a31-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "423909c9-ddf6-4537-a4bb-478055e97a03", "children": ["62e8ea08-1f53-4afe-b350-6e26d636f83b"]}, "62e8ea08-1f53-4afe-b350-6e26d636f83b": {"id": "62e8ea08-1f53-4afe-b350-6e26d636f83b", "message": {"id": "62e8ea08-1f53-4afe-b350-6e26d636f83b", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1730476472.516041, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Your brand/logo for &quot;Lexology Enterprises&quot; is visually charming and conveys a whimsical, creative vibe, which is fitting given the tagline &quot;From Dream to Page to Product.&quot; Here are my thoughts:\n\n1. **Color Palette**: The soft purple and pastel tones evoke a dreamy, imaginative feeling, which aligns well with the concept of taking dreams and turning them into a tangible product.

If you want to emphasize the full-service, structured consulting nature as well, you could consider adding a secondary, more formal font to balance out the playful nature. Adding a darker complementary color could also introduce a bit of gravity.\n\n3. **Tagline Adjustment**: The tagline \u201cFrom Dream to Page to Product\u201d is excellent for conveying creativity and ideation, but consider adding another tagline or descriptor that emphasizes your consulting and operational management services, such as &quot;Transforming Ideas with Strategy &amp; Efficiency.&quot;\n\nOverall, the logo sets a nice tone for the imaginative and ideation phases of your work, but adding some elements or tweaks could enhance its alignment with the structured, consulting side of your business.

Here are some observations on how the logo and the resume align with your intended brand:\n\n### **Logo Analysis**\n- **Creative, Visionary Elements**: The stars, book, and the whimsical typography continue to evoke a sense of creativity, which is great for conveying the &quot;idea&quot; and &quot;dream&quot; phase of your services.\n- **Added Icon**: The added symbol with the tagline &quot;Ideas to Reality&quot; adds a sense of practicality and purpose, bridging the gap between creativity and execution. The symbol also suggests a more structured, professional side to the business, which aligns with the consulting and project management aspects.\n- **Overall Feel**: The updated logo is still visually appealing and inviting, with the added elements helping to balance the artistic and professional sides of your brand.\n\n### **Resume Alignment**\n- Your resume demonstrates your broad and versatile skill set, covering areas such as operations management, customer success, software development, and project management, which are directly in line with the services you plan to offer.\n- **Experience in Multiple Domains**: Your experience as a Customer Success Manager, Service Delivery Manager, and roles in operations and logistics highlights your capability to support businesses across various stages\u2014much like your brand promises (&quot;From Dream to Page to Product&quot;).\n- **Project Management and Consulting**: The skills you&#x27;ve demonstrated in planning, improving processes, managing large-scale projects, and developing relationships are perfectly aligned with the consulting, operations/logistics, and full-scale project management services you intend to provide.\n- **Hands-On Execution and Leadership**: The achievements listed, such as increasing productivity, managing large portfolios, and enhancing team performance, show that you\u2019re not only about high-level strategy but also about hands-on, effective execution\u2014this matches well with your firm\u2019s value proposition of being a partner in realizing and executing ideas.\n\n### **Suggestions for Alignment**\n1. **Balance the Vision and Execution**: If you want to further align your branding (logo) with the broad spectrum of services, consider adding subtle elements that symbolize process and organization. This could be represented by gears, graphs, or arrows that hint at growth and strategy.\n2. **Tagline Consideration**: You could add a secondary tagline or descriptor on your website or business card to emphasize the operational side, such as \u201cFrom Vision to Strategy &amp; Execution\u201d or &quot;Creative Concepts with Operational Precision.&quot;\n3. **Resume Highlights**: Your resume is already quite strong, but if you plan to use it for pitching your business services, you might want to add a brief &quot;Objective&quot; or &quot;Statement of Purpose&quot; that connects your professional history to the new venture\u2014highlighting how your diverse experience translates into client success.\n\nThe combination of your updated logo and well-rounded resume presents Lexology Enterprises as both creative and practical\u2014a blend of inspiration with real-world business execution.

This symbol captures the essence of the business while being easy to recognize even at smaller sizes.\n   - Make the background simpler so that the focus remains on the book and brand name.\n\n3. **Typography-First Approach**:\n   - Use just the words \u201cLexology Enterprises\u201d with a more minimal background, maybe just the watercolor cloud behind the text.\n   - Add some of the stars or sparkles to maintain the magical, imaginative feel, but keep them subtle.\n\n### **Considerations for Profile Picture**:\n- **Legibility**: Ensure that any text on the image is large enough to read clearly, even when viewed at a small scale.\n- **Visual Focus**: Profile images are best when they have a simple, bold symbol or centerpiece. The book and the phrase &quot;Ideas to Reality&quot; could serve as that focus.\n- **Color Palette**: Stick with the current color scheme (lavender, purple, soft tones) to ensure a cohesive brand look.\n\n### Example Workflow:\n- Take the central part of your current banner (the open book and the name &quot;Lexology Enterprises&quot;).\n- Remove some of the smaller details to avoid making it appear cluttered.\n- Emphasize the &quot;Ideas to Reality&quot; icon in the profile image for easy recognition.\n\nIf you need specific help creating this simplified image, I can guide you on what software or tools to use or help refine the concept further!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o-canmore", "parent_id": "aaa2f800-64ff-4d9e-ad8a-a3e172e478fa", "request_id": "8dbd5f813ebd0f76-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2f800-64ff-4d9e-ad8a-a3e172e478fa", "children": ["aaa2c459-895a-4d97-9156-06587a38fbc9"]}, "aaa2c459-895a-4d97-9156-06587a38fbc9": {"id": "aaa2c459-895a-4d97-9156-06587a38fbc9", "message": {"id": "aaa2c459-895a-4d97-9156-06587a38fbc9", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1730479754.025864, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I thought maybe you could do it for me"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8dbd607cf8cb0d6d-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "d1ae0d0d-f72f-4e26-9117-2af5acf070d8", "children": ["6664a7ae-b8fb-48bc-acf0-d2e3b5e2c4a8"]}, "6664a7ae-b8fb-48bc-acf0-d2e3b5e2c4a8": {"id": "6664a7ae-b8fb-48bc-acf0-d2e3b5e2c4a8", "message": {"id": "6664a7ae-b8fb-48bc-acf0-d2e3b5e2c4a8", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1730479764.742447, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I currently can&#x27;t directly create graphic images like a logo or profile picture myself, but I can guide you on how to make one using tools like **Canva**, **Figma**, or **Adobe Express**, which are all beginner-friendly platforms.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple step-by-step guide using **Canva** (which is free and user-friendly):\n\n### Steps to Create a Profile Image Inspired by Your Logo:\n1. **Open Canva**:\n   - Go to [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and create an account if you don&#x27;t have one.\n\n2. **Create a New Design**:\n   - Click on &quot;Create a Design&quot; and choose a **custom size**: 500 x 500 pixels is ideal for profile pictures.\n\n3. **Upload Your Current Banner Elements**:\n   - Upload the elements from your banner, like the open book, the stars, and the text (&quot;Lexology Enterprises&quot;).\n   - You can do this by clicking on &quot;Uploads&quot; in the left sidebar and selecting the file.\n\n4. **Arrange the Elements**:\n   - Use the open book as the base.\n   - Add the brand name &quot;Lexology Enterprises&quot; in a readable size above the book.\n   - Keep the &quot;Ideas to Reality&quot; icon or simplify it for clarity.\n   - Add subtle stars or sparkles for a consistent aesthetic without overwhelming the smaller space.\n\n5. **Choose a Background**:\n   - Use a simple, light lavender or pastel color to match your current branding but avoid distracting from the central logo elements.\n\n6. **Adjust the Composition**:\n   - Ensure that the text is large and easy to read. Since profile images are small, the text should be bold and clear.\n   - Make sure there is enough contrast between the text and the background for easy visibility.\n\n7. **Download**:\n   - Once you&#x27;re happy with the design, click on &quot;Download&quot; in the top right corner, and choose PNG format for better quality.\n\nIf you still feel unsure, I can help guide you through each step in more detail!

In fact, although it is possible to upload the catalog of products on Meta, content with clickable products always redirects to an external product page outside of the social media platform, and in fact Meta does not manage the transaction (except with specific solutions for some countries and for some Profiles/Brands, as of today).\n\nWith TikTok Shop, on the other hand, you can complete a purchase in a few clicks without ever leaving the app. TikTok provides seller support and should handle orders, shipments, and money flow internally.  \nIn this way, TikTok Shop would position itself as a kind of integrated marketplace within the social media platform.\n\nTikTok provides 4 native formats for shopping on the platform:\n\n  * Live shopping: You can purchase directly during creators\u2019 live streams by tapping on pinned products or exploring the shopping icon.\n  * Shoppable videos: In-feed video content with clickable shop icons.\n  * Product showcase: Showcase of products that you can find on brand or creator profiles.\n  * Shop tab: Personalized shopping exploration section that groups various brands and different types of content.\n\n[Image 1: Immagine con 3 mockup di smartphone con differenti schermate di Tik Tok Shop][Image 2: Immagine con 3 mockup di smartphone con differenti schermate di Tik Tok Shop]\n\n## The crucial role of creators in TikTok Shop \n\nIf creators were already crucial on Instagram, they become even more so on TikTok. The reason is simple.  \nIn-App purchases allow creators to sell the products they promote directly.  \nWhile on Meta, creators or influencers lend their testimony to drive traffic and conversions to the websites of the brands they collaborate with, on TikTok, users purchase directly through the creators\u2019 channels.\n\nThis has two fundamental consequences:\n\n  1. Small businesses enter the game by creating content to sell their products directly. In this initial phase, TikTok\u2019s algorithm favors Shop content, offering great visibility to sellers and favorable commissions.\n  2. Medium/large brands can rely on creators to sell their products, without the need to internally produce content. This way, the brand does not have to invest resources in managing social media and can leverage the creator\u2019s fanbase.\n\nThe role of creators is therefore increasingly crucial in supporting brands in their online sales. The advertising style of creators is engaging and fun, reducing friction in the consumer\u2019s purchase journey, who immediately associates a positive feeling with the product being sold.  \nOne could speak of \u201cadvertainment\u201d, a creative and well-executed advertising message, that also provides entertainment to users who choose to watch it.\n\n### Collaborations with creators are more transparent thanks to the Tik Tok Affiliation circuit \n\nMore and more brands are opting to collaborate with influencers and creators for promoting their products, but the results are not always as expected.\n\nOn Instagram, we\u2019re accustomed to hefty paychecks, with no guarantee in return that the influencer\u2019s testimony adds value to the promotion.  \nThe fee is determined by the number of contents produced by the influencer rather than the actual sales generated by their content.  \nThis opaque collaboration mode has led to a sentiment of distrust towards influencer marketing in some cases. Consider the recent Balocco case: Chiara Ferragni received a high fee for promoting the pandori, which was not tied to the quantity of pandori sold, nor was the charity donation amount linked to the promo\u2019s success.\n\nBut on TikTok, the Affiliation circuit addresses this issue. The affiliation circuit serves as a platform that connects sellers looking to promote their products through influencers with creators seeking commercial opportunities and products to recommend. Once the partnership between the seller and influencer is established, the creator\u2019s commission is automatically paid by the platform when a user makes a purchase directly from their channel. This way, the seller only pays the influencer based on the sales they generate on their profile.  \nThe affiliation circuit also benefits creators by providing them with a platform to showcase themselves to brands, without the need for intermediary influencer marketing agencies. Additionally, even creators with a limited fanbase will have the opportunity to monetize, as the promo fee will depend solely on their ability to communicate with their audience.\n\nTikTok\u2019s affiliation circuit thus represents a default and transparent mode of operation for influencer marketing, ushering in a new era that is fairer and based on merit.\n\n[Image 3: Immagine con 4 mockup di smartphone che rappresentano le fasi di acquisto su Tik Tok Shop: Product link, product detail page, selection option e checkout][Image 4: Immagine con 4 mockup di smartphone che rappresentano le fasi di acquisto su Tik Tok Shop: Product link, product detail page, selection option e checkout]\n\n### Which product categories are popular on TikTok Shop?\n\nAlthough the TikTok Shop experience has just begun, we already have the first statistics from the United States telling us which products are most appreciated and purchased by TikTok users.\n\nThe Beauty and Personal Care sector is decidedly the most appreciated, representing 22.5% of the entire market share. Women\u2019s Clothing and Intimates is the second most purchased category through TikTok Shop, accounting for 12.5% of purchases, while Men\u2019s Clothing and Intimates ranks third, with a preference rate of 8%.\n\nAs is already the case on Instagram, on TikTok, the female target audience appears to be the most responsive to the allure of social shopping.\n\nDo you want to sell online or are you looking for someone to boost your sales?\n\n####    \nDiscuss it with Matteo!\n\nMatteo Doveri Account Executive\n\n\u30107\u2020Book a meeting\u3011\n\n#### Continua a leggere \n\n4 minutes of reading\n\n[Image 5: Environment, the hidden CO2 emissions of the Internet][Image 6: Environment, the hidden CO2 emissions of", "title": "TikTok Shop also arrives in Europe.

Maximize the products uploaded to TikTok Shop (TTS). Do not only upload your bestselling products or products that you believe will sell well on TikTok Shop. We strongly recommend uploading all products available to help increase exposure among potential shoppers.\n\n2. Maximize the number of Shoppable Video posts on your TikTok account. Do not only upload videos that have performed well on other platforms or that you believe will perform well on TikTok. Uploading videos on TikTok requires no additional costs. We strongly recommend posting as many videos as possible on your TikTok account to help increase exposure among potential shoppers.\n\n3. Add TikTok Shop Product Link (the little orange cart) to all relevant videos on your TikTok account. While it is best practice to ensure the linked product matches the video content, it is more important to have a TikTok Shop Product Link on as many video posts as possible.\n\n4. Participate in the open affiliate plan. You may participate in the targeted plan if you are already familiar with creators and have an existing creator pipeline. Tips on commission rate: If no benchmarks have been set before, we recommend starting with a 10% commission rate, and gradually reducing it to 5% or 1% as your TikTok Shop GMV grows.\n\n5. Start with \u30103\u2020Video Shopping Ads\u3011 (VSA) for TikTok Shop, prioritizing existing videos from your TikTok account that have already generated organic conversions (Spark Ads). Note that when using an existing video as an asset for Video Shopping Ads, the Video Shopping Ads will use the products chosen during ad creation in the ad link. You can choose to advertise the same or different list of products for the Video Shopping Ads vs. the organic link. You can even run a Video Shopping Ads with an existing video that has no organic link.\n\n6. If using new videos as an asset for Video Shopping Ads through TikTok Ads Manager (not using Spark Ads), we recommend posting the video with the TikTok Shop Product Link on your TikTok account first, unless you are testing multiple variations of video captions, for which you may choose ads-only mode for some of the ads.\n\n7. Try to acquire affiliate videos that have been generating GMV for you and/or have high GPM (GMV per impression) as ad creatives assets. Obtain the video code from the affiliate creator. You can see all affiliate videos that have been generating GMV for you in the affiliate section of Seller Center and directly message the creator from Seller Center via Creator Connect.\n\n8. Try to use as many videos and/or TikTok Shop Product Links as possible under the same VSA ad group budget, ideally with 3-5 active video creatives in each ad group. Use the highest gross revenue and cost cap bid strategies according to preference and experiment with a combination of these two bid strategies. Experiment with using single product links (only one product per ad) and multiple product links (multiple products per ad) to test what works better for your business, as results may vary for different sellers.\n\n9. For the highest gross revenue ad group, keep scaling the budget every week, each time observing the ROAS of the previous 7 days on a rolling basis, and increase or decrease the budget as necessary. For cost cap, we recommend maximizing the budget after the ad has run for more than a day.\n\n10. Besides the 1 official TikTok account connected to your TikTok Shop, you can additionally connect up to 4 more TikTok accounts with your TikTok Shop for marketing purposes. Take advantage of this by differentiating your marketing accounts based on persona categories to cater to different audience preferences, presenting &quot;UGC&quot; style native content. This helps to broaden your interested audiences.\n\n11. If you are running a LIVE Shopping event, we highly recommend running \u30104\u2020Live Shopping Ads\u3011 (LSA), optimizing towards Gross Revenue, and starting with a budget of a few hundred dollars. LIVE Shopping events or LSA may or may not work well for your business. LIVE Shopping performance can be volatile but can work well for some businesses.\n\n12. TikTok Shop does not only offer ads GMV but also trackable organic GMV. It also offers a potentially large pool of &quot;referral&quot; style affiliate creatives that you can use for ads or other purposes.\n\n13. When considering Shop Ads performance, in addition to reviewing Shop Ads ROAS performance, we recommend reviewing overall TikTok Shop marketing ROI, which equates to [Shop total GMV / (Shop Ads ads cost + Shop affiliate commission)]. Consider how much GMV (paid, affiliate, organic) you are getting out of your marketing investment in TikTok Shop. Evaluate your TikTok Shop marketing ROI against your typical marketing ROI targets.\n\nContent Hide content \n\nOur Products\n\n* \u30105\u2020TikTok for Business\u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30106\u2020TikTok\u2020tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30107\u2020Creative Center\u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u00a92024 TikTok For Business \n\n* \u30108\u2020 Terms &amp; Policies \u3011\n* \u30109\u2020 Privacy \u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30100\u2020 Help \u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "title": "Business Help Center", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "Business Help Center", "url": "https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/considerations-when-launching-your-tiktok-shop-journey?lang=en", "text": "\nURL: https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/considerations-when-launching-your-tiktok-shop-journey?lang=en\n\u30100\u2020 Business Help Center\u3011 \n\n\u30101\u2020Create an Ad\u3011\n\n[Image 0] \n\nConsiderations when launching your TikTok Shop Journey\n\nLast updated, May 2024 \n\nTikTok Shop is now available in the following markets: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam.\n\nYou can directly create your TikTok Shop at \u30102\u2020TikTok Seller Center\u2020seller.tiktok.com\u3011.\n\nAfter creating your TikTok Shop, start your marketing and sales efforts with these recommended steps. \n\n1.

The new function that will change the approach to online shopping. - HT&amp;T Consulting .", "url": "https://www.htt.it/en/tiktok-shop-also-arrives-in-europe-online-shopping/", "text": "But Instagram and Facebook represent only two showcases for brands, and purchases continue to be made on e-commerce and marketplace platforms. In fact, although it is possible to upload the catalog of products on Meta, content with clickable products always redirects to an external product page outside of the social media platform, and in fact Meta does not manage the transaction (except with specific solutions for some countries and for some Profiles/Brands, as of today).\n\nWith TikTok Shop, on the other hand, you can complete a purchase in a few clicks without ever leaving the app. TikTok provides seller support and should handle orders, shipments, and money flow internally.  \nIn this way, TikTok Shop would position itself as a kind of integrated marketplace within the social media platform.\n\nTikTok provides 4 native formats for shopping on the platform:\n\n  * Live shopping: You can purchase directly during creators\u2019 live streams by tapping on pinned products or exploring the shopping icon.\n  * Shoppable videos: In-feed video content with clickable shop icons.\n  * Product showcase: Showcase of products that you can find on brand or creator profiles.\n  * Shop tab: Personalized shopping exploration section that groups various brands and different types of content.\n\n[Image 1: Immagine con 3 mockup di smartphone con differenti schermate di Tik Tok Shop][Image 2: Immagine con 3 mockup di smartphone con differenti schermate di Tik Tok Shop]\n\n## The crucial role of creators in TikTok Shop \n\nIf creators were already crucial on Instagram, they become even more so on TikTok. The reason is simple.  \nIn-App purchases allow creators to sell the products they promote directly.  \nWhile on Meta, creators or influencers lend their testimony to drive traffic and conversions to the websites of the brands they collaborate with, on TikTok, users purchase directly through the creators\u2019 channels.\n\nThis has two fundamental consequences:\n\n  1. Small businesses enter the game by creating content to sell their products directly. In this initial phase, TikTok\u2019s algorithm favors Shop content, offering great visibility to sellers and favorable commissions.\n  2. Medium/large brands can rely on creators to sell their products, without the need to internally produce content. This way, the brand does not have to invest resources in managing social media and can leverage the creator\u2019s fanbase.\n\nThe role of creators is therefore increasingly crucial in supporting brands in their online sales. The advertising style of creators is engaging and fun, reducing friction in the consumer\u2019s purchase journey, who immediately associates a positive feeling with the product being sold.  \nOne could speak of \u201cadvertainment\u201d, a creative and well-executed advertising message, that also provides entertainment to users who choose to watch it.\n\n### Collaborations with creators are more transparent thanks to the Tik Tok Affiliation circuit \n\nMore and more brands are opting to collaborate with influencers and creators for promoting their products, but the results are not always as expected.\n\nOn Instagram, we\u2019re accustomed to hefty paychecks, with no guarantee in return that the influencer\u2019s testimony adds value to the promotion.  \nThe fee is determined by the number of contents produced by the influencer rather than the actual sales generated by their content.  \nThis opaque collaboration mode has led to a sentiment of distrust towards influencer marketing in some cases. Consider the recent Balocco case: Chiara Ferragni received a high fee for promoting the pandori, which was not tied to the quantity of pandori sold, nor was the charity donation amount linked to the promo\u2019s success.\n\nBut on TikTok, the Affiliation circuit addresses this issue. The affiliation circuit serves as a platform that connects sellers looking to promote their products through influencers with creators seeking commercial opportunities and products to recommend. Once the partnership between the seller and influencer is established, the creator\u2019s commission is automatically paid by the platform when a user makes a purchase directly from their channel. This way, the seller only pays the influencer based on the sales they generate on their profile.  \nThe affiliation circuit also benefits creators by providing them with a platform to showcase themselves to brands, without the need for intermediary influencer marketing agencies. Additionally, even creators with a limited fanbase will have the opportunity to monetize, as the promo fee will depend solely on their ability to communicate with their audience.\n\nTikTok\u2019s affiliation circuit thus represents a default and transparent mode of operation for influencer marketing, ushering in a new era that is fairer and based on merit.\n\n[Image 3: Immagine con 4 mockup di smartphone che rappresentano le fasi di acquisto su Tik Tok Shop: Product link, product detail page, selection option e checkout][Image 4: Immagine con 4 mockup di smartphone che rappresentano le fasi di acquisto su Tik Tok Shop: Product link, product detail page, selection option e checkout]\n\n### Which product categories are popular on TikTok Shop?\n\nAlthough the TikTok Shop experience has just begun, we already have the first statistics from the United States telling us which products are most appreciated and purchased by TikTok users.\n\nThe Beauty and Personal Care sector is decidedly the most appreciated, representing 22.5% of the entire market share. Women\u2019s Clothing and Intimates is the second most purchased category through TikTok Shop, accounting for 12.5% of purchases, while Men\u2019s Clothing and Intimates ranks third, with a preference rate of 8%.\n\nAs is already the case on Instagram, on TikTok, the female target audience appears to be the most responsive to the allure of social shopping.\n\nDo you want to sell online or are you looking for someone to boost your sales?\n\n####    \nDiscuss it with Matteo!\n\nMatteo Doveri Account Executive\n\n\u30107\u2020Book a meeting\u3011\n\n#### Continua a leggere \n\n4 minutes of reading\n\n[Image 5: Environment, the hidden CO2 emissions of the Internet][Image 6: Environment, the hidden CO2 emissions of", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 8, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 475, "end_ix": 485, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "TikTok Shopping &amp; Showcase | TikTok For Business", "url": "https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-shopping-and-showcase?lang=it", "text": "\nUna scheda Vetrina dei prodotti pu\u00f2 contenere prodotti delle seguenti opzioni:\n\n  * Tutti i prodotti di un TikTok Shop.\n\n  * Alcuni prodotti di un negozio.\n\n  * Prodotti provenienti da pi\u00f9 negozi.\n\n[Image 1: TikTok Shopping and Showcase-PNG]\n\n## Ecco cosa devi sapere prima di utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina \n\n  1. TikTok Shop e le Presentazioni non sono uguali.\n\n     * Se hai soltanto una Vetrina e non un TikTok Shop, puoi comunque fare pubblicit\u00e0 utilizzando i prodotti nella tua vetrina e fare riferimento a \u30103\u2020Come configurare Video Shopping Ads con Vetrina\u3011.\n\n     * Se scegli Vetrina o TikTok Shop come origine prodotto, l\u2019elenco dei prodotti che possono essere selezionati per la pubblicit\u00e0 cambia di conseguenza.\n\n     * Ricordati che TikTok Shop contiene l\u2019inventario dei prodotti di propriet\u00e0 del venditore. Se vendi i prodotti attraverso un account affiliato o di marketing, \u00e8 possibile che tu possieda un TikTok Shop.\n\n  2. Da notare che non tutti coloro che possiedono una Vetrina hanno un TikTok Shop.\n\n     * Ad esempio, un brand pu\u00f2 concedere a un terzo l\u2019autorizzazione a vendere prodotti a suo nome. Questi prodotti sono visualizzati nella Vetrina del terzo per essere acquistati dai clienti. Un terzo non possiede i prodotti che vende, ma piuttosto vende i prodotti per conto del brand.\n\n## Ecco cosa devi sapere per utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina \n\nPossedere una Vetrina non significa necessariamente possedere un TikTok Shop. Gli esempi che seguono mostrano i diversi scenari che si verificano tra TikTok Shop e Vetrina.\n\n### Esempi \n\n  1. Per un account TikTok ufficiale, tutti i prodotti di un brand verranno automaticamente visualizzati nella loro Vetrina.\n\n  2. Un brand pu\u00f2 consentire agli account commerciali/affiliati di vendere i prodotti per suo conto. La Vetrina degli account commerciali/affiliati visualizzer\u00e0 alcuni o tutti i prodotti di un negozio.\n\n     * Esempio 1: un brand di calzature pu\u00f2 consentire a pi\u00f9 account commerciali, gestiti da terzi, di vendere prodotti a suo nome.\n\n     * Esempio 2: due brand diversi di calzature possono consentire a un account affiliato/di marketing gestito da un importante rivenditore al dettaglio o da uno store specializzato di vendere prodotti per conto di entrambi i brand.\n\n## Come utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina\n\n### Come account TikTok ufficiale \n\nSe sei un account TikTok ufficiale con un TikTok Shop, la tua Vetrina mostrer\u00e0 tutti i tuoi prodotti.\n\n##### Come sono collegati i tuoi prodotti tra TikTok Shop e Vetrina:\n\n  * In Seller Center collega un account TikTok ufficiale. Dopo che il titolare dell\u2019account TikTok ha confermato il link, tutti i prodotti del TikTok Shop vengono automaticamente visualizzati nella Vetrina.\n\n  * Il link dipende dal Paese in cui vende lo shop.

The new function that will change the approach to online shopping. - HT&amp;T Consulting .", "url": "https://www.htt.it/en/tiktok-shop-also-arrives-in-europe-online-shopping/", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "But Instagram and Facebook represent only two showcases for brands, and purchases continue to be made on e-commerce and marketplace platforms. In fact, although it is possible to upload the catalog of products on Meta, content with clickable products always redirects to an external product page outside of the social media platform, and in fact Meta does not manage the transaction (except with specific solutions for some countries and for some Profiles/Brands, as of today).\n\nWith TikTok Shop, on the other hand, you can complete a purchase in a few clicks without ever leaving the app. TikTok provides seller support and should handle orders, shipments, and money flow internally.  \nIn this way, TikTok Shop would position itself as a kind of integrated marketplace within the social media platform.\n\nTikTok provides 4 native formats for shopping on the platform:\n\n  * Live shopping: You can purchase directly during creators\u2019 live streams by tapping on pinned products or exploring the shopping icon.\n  * Shoppable videos: In-feed video content with clickable shop icons.\n  * Product showcase: Showcase of products that you can find on brand or creator profiles.\n  * Shop tab: Personalized shopping exploration section that groups various brands and different types of content.\n\n[Image 1: Immagine con 3 mockup di smartphone con differenti schermate di Tik Tok Shop][Image 2: Immagine con 3 mockup di smartphone con differenti schermate di Tik Tok Shop]\n\n## The crucial role of creators in TikTok Shop \n\nIf creators were already crucial on Instagram, they become even more so on TikTok. The reason is simple.  \nIn-App purchases allow creators to sell the products they promote directly.  \nWhile on Meta, creators or influencers lend their testimony to drive traffic and conversions to the websites of the brands they collaborate with, on TikTok, users purchase directly through the creators\u2019 channels.\n\nThis has two fundamental consequences:\n\n  1. Small businesses enter the game by creating content to sell their products directly. In this initial phase, TikTok\u2019s algorithm favors Shop content, offering great visibility to sellers and favorable commissions.\n  2. Medium/large brands can rely on creators to sell their products, without the need to internally produce content. This way, the brand does not have to invest resources in managing social media and can leverage the creator\u2019s fanbase.\n\nThe role of creators is therefore increasingly crucial in supporting brands in their online sales. The advertising style of creators is engaging and fun, reducing friction in the consumer\u2019s purchase journey, who immediately associates a positive feeling with the product being sold.  \nOne could speak of \u201cadvertainment\u201d, a creative and well-executed advertising message, that also provides entertainment to users who choose to watch it.\n\n### Collaborations with creators are more transparent thanks to the Tik Tok Affiliation circuit \n\nMore and more brands are opting to collaborate with influencers and creators for promoting their products, but the results are not always as expected.\n\nOn Instagram, we\u2019re accustomed to hefty paychecks, with no guarantee in return that the influencer\u2019s testimony adds value to the promotion.  \nThe fee is determined by the number of contents produced by the influencer rather than the actual sales generated by their content.  \nThis opaque collaboration mode has led to a sentiment of distrust towards influencer marketing in some cases. Consider the recent Balocco case: Chiara Ferragni received a high fee for promoting the pandori, which was not tied to the quantity of pandori sold, nor was the charity donation amount linked to the promo\u2019s success.\n\nBut on TikTok, the Affiliation circuit addresses this issue. The affiliation circuit serves as a platform that connects sellers looking to promote their products through influencers with creators seeking commercial opportunities and products to recommend. Once the partnership between the seller and influencer is established, the creator\u2019s commission is automatically paid by the platform when a user makes a purchase directly from their channel. This way, the seller only pays the influencer based on the sales they generate on their profile.  \nThe affiliation circuit also benefits creators by providing them with a platform to showcase themselves to brands, without the need for intermediary influencer marketing agencies. Additionally, even creators with a limited fanbase will have the opportunity to monetize, as the promo fee will depend solely on their ability to communicate with their audience.\n\nTikTok\u2019s affiliation circuit thus represents a default and transparent mode of operation for influencer marketing, ushering in a new era that is fairer and based on merit.\n\n[Image 3: Immagine con 4 mockup di smartphone che rappresentano le fasi di acquisto su Tik Tok Shop: Product link, product detail page, selection option e checkout][Image 4: Immagine con 4 mockup di smartphone che rappresentano le fasi di acquisto su Tik Tok Shop: Product link, product detail page, selection option e checkout]\n\n### Which product categories are popular on TikTok Shop?\n\nAlthough the TikTok Shop experience has just begun, we already have the first statistics from the United States telling us which products are most appreciated and purchased by TikTok users.\n\nThe Beauty and Personal Care sector is decidedly the most appreciated, representing 22.5% of the entire market share. Women\u2019s Clothing and Intimates is the second most purchased category through TikTok Shop, accounting for 12.5% of purchases, while Men\u2019s Clothing and Intimates ranks third, with a preference rate of 8%.\n\nAs is already the case on Instagram, on TikTok, the female target audience appears to be the most responsive to the allure of social shopping.\n\nDo you want to sell online or are you looking for someone to boost your sales?\n\n####    \nDiscuss it with Matteo!\n\nMatteo Doveri Account Executive\n\n\u30107\u2020Book a meeting\u3011\n\n#### Continua a leggere \n\n4 minutes of reading\n\n[Image 5: Environment, the hidden CO2 emissions of the Internet][Image 6: Environment, the hidden CO2 emissions of"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 475, "end_idx": 485, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "TikTok Shopping &amp; Showcase | TikTok For Business", "url": "https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-shopping-and-showcase?lang=it", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nUna scheda Vetrina dei prodotti pu\u00f2 contenere prodotti delle seguenti opzioni:\n\n  * Tutti i prodotti di un TikTok Shop.\n\n  * Alcuni prodotti di un negozio.\n\n  * Prodotti provenienti da pi\u00f9 negozi.\n\n[Image 1: TikTok Shopping and Showcase-PNG]\n\n## Ecco cosa devi sapere prima di utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina \n\n  1.

This account will be essential for managing your shop and linking products to your videos.\n\n2. **Register for TikTok Shop**:\n   - Visit the **TikTok Seller Center** and sign up as a seller.\n   - You\u2019ll need to provide business information such as your company name, address, and tax ID, as well as proof of identity.\n   - Some countries may have specific requirements or limitations, so ensure you meet those for your region.\n\n3. **Set Up Your Product Inventory**:\n   - Once registered, you can upload your products directly to the TikTok Shop.\n   - Ensure that all product descriptions, prices, and photos are optimized for visibility. TikTok encourages sellers to upload as many products as possible to increase exposure\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Link Products to TikTok Content**:\n   - You can link products to your videos, live streams, and even your TikTok profile\u2019s shop tab.

Maximize the products uploaded to TikTok Shop (TTS). Do not only upload your bestselling products or products that you believe will sell well on TikTok Shop. We strongly recommend uploading all products available to help increase exposure among potential shoppers.\n\n2. Maximize the number of Shoppable Video posts on your TikTok account. Do not only upload videos that have performed well on other platforms or that you believe will perform well on TikTok. Uploading videos on TikTok requires no additional costs. We strongly recommend posting as many videos as possible on your TikTok account to help increase exposure among potential shoppers.\n\n3. Add TikTok Shop Product Link (the little orange cart) to all relevant videos on your TikTok account. While it is best practice to ensure the linked product matches the video content, it is more important to have a TikTok Shop Product Link on as many video posts as possible.\n\n4. Participate in the open affiliate plan. You may participate in the targeted plan if you are already familiar with creators and have an existing creator pipeline. Tips on commission rate: If no benchmarks have been set before, we recommend starting with a 10% commission rate, and gradually reducing it to 5% or 1% as your TikTok Shop GMV grows.\n\n5. Start with \u30103\u2020Video Shopping Ads\u3011 (VSA) for TikTok Shop, prioritizing existing videos from your TikTok account that have already generated organic conversions (Spark Ads). Note that when using an existing video as an asset for Video Shopping Ads, the Video Shopping Ads will use the products chosen during ad creation in the ad link. You can choose to advertise the same or different list of products for the Video Shopping Ads vs. the organic link. You can even run a Video Shopping Ads with an existing video that has no organic link.\n\n6. If using new videos as an asset for Video Shopping Ads through TikTok Ads Manager (not using Spark Ads), we recommend posting the video with the TikTok Shop Product Link on your TikTok account first, unless you are testing multiple variations of video captions, for which you may choose ads-only mode for some of the ads.\n\n7. Try to acquire affiliate videos that have been generating GMV for you and/or have high GPM (GMV per impression) as ad creatives assets. Obtain the video code from the affiliate creator. You can see all affiliate videos that have been generating GMV for you in the affiliate section of Seller Center and directly message the creator from Seller Center via Creator Connect.\n\n8. Try to use as many videos and/or TikTok Shop Product Links as possible under the same VSA ad group budget, ideally with 3-5 active video creatives in each ad group. Use the highest gross revenue and cost cap bid strategies according to preference and experiment with a combination of these two bid strategies. Experiment with using single product links (only one product per ad) and multiple product links (multiple products per ad) to test what works better for your business, as results may vary for different sellers.\n\n9. For the highest gross revenue ad group, keep scaling the budget every week, each time observing the ROAS of the previous 7 days on a rolling basis, and increase or decrease the budget as necessary. For cost cap, we recommend maximizing the budget after the ad has run for more than a day.\n\n10. Besides the 1 official TikTok account connected to your TikTok Shop, you can additionally connect up to 4 more TikTok accounts with your TikTok Shop for marketing purposes. Take advantage of this by differentiating your marketing accounts based on persona categories to cater to different audience preferences, presenting &quot;UGC&quot; style native content. This helps to broaden your interested audiences.\n\n11. If you are running a LIVE Shopping event, we highly recommend running \u30104\u2020Live Shopping Ads\u3011 (LSA), optimizing towards Gross Revenue, and starting with a budget of a few hundred dollars. LIVE Shopping events or LSA may or may not work well for your business. LIVE Shopping performance can be volatile but can work well for some businesses.\n\n12. TikTok Shop does not only offer ads GMV but also trackable organic GMV. It also offers a potentially large pool of &quot;referral&quot; style affiliate creatives that you can use for ads or other purposes.\n\n13. When considering Shop Ads performance, in addition to reviewing Shop Ads ROAS performance, we recommend reviewing overall TikTok Shop marketing ROI, which equates to [Shop total GMV / (Shop Ads ads cost + Shop affiliate commission)]. Consider how much GMV (paid, affiliate, organic) you are getting out of your marketing investment in TikTok Shop. Evaluate your TikTok Shop marketing ROI against your typical marketing ROI targets.\n\nContent Hide content \n\nOur Products\n\n* \u30105\u2020TikTok for Business\u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30106\u2020TikTok\u2020tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30107\u2020Creative Center\u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u00a92024 TikTok For Business \n\n* \u30108\u2020 Terms &amp; Policies \u3011\n* \u30109\u2020 Privacy \u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30100\u2020 Help \u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 10, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1384, "end_ix": 1394, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "TikTok Shopping &amp; Showcase | TikTok For Business", "url": "https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-shopping-and-showcase?lang=it", "text": "\nUna scheda Vetrina dei prodotti pu\u00f2 contenere prodotti delle seguenti opzioni:\n\n  * Tutti i prodotti di un TikTok Shop.\n\n  * Alcuni prodotti di un negozio.\n\n  * Prodotti provenienti da pi\u00f9 negozi.\n\n[Image 1: TikTok Shopping and Showcase-PNG]\n\n## Ecco cosa devi sapere prima di utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina \n\n  1.

Maximize the products uploaded to TikTok Shop (TTS). Do not only upload your bestselling products or products that you believe will sell well on TikTok Shop. We strongly recommend uploading all products available to help increase exposure among potential shoppers.\n\n2. Maximize the number of Shoppable Video posts on your TikTok account. Do not only upload videos that have performed well on other platforms or that you believe will perform well on TikTok. Uploading videos on TikTok requires no additional costs. We strongly recommend posting as many videos as possible on your TikTok account to help increase exposure among potential shoppers.\n\n3. Add TikTok Shop Product Link (the little orange cart) to all relevant videos on your TikTok account. While it is best practice to ensure the linked product matches the video content, it is more important to have a TikTok Shop Product Link on as many video posts as possible.\n\n4. Participate in the open affiliate plan. You may participate in the targeted plan if you are already familiar with creators and have an existing creator pipeline. Tips on commission rate: If no benchmarks have been set before, we recommend starting with a 10% commission rate, and gradually reducing it to 5% or 1% as your TikTok Shop GMV grows.\n\n5. Start with \u30103\u2020Video Shopping Ads\u3011 (VSA) for TikTok Shop, prioritizing existing videos from your TikTok account that have already generated organic conversions (Spark Ads). Note that when using an existing video as an asset for Video Shopping Ads, the Video Shopping Ads will use the products chosen during ad creation in the ad link. You can choose to advertise the same or different list of products for the Video Shopping Ads vs. the organic link. You can even run a Video Shopping Ads with an existing video that has no organic link.\n\n6. If using new videos as an asset for Video Shopping Ads through TikTok Ads Manager (not using Spark Ads), we recommend posting the video with the TikTok Shop Product Link on your TikTok account first, unless you are testing multiple variations of video captions, for which you may choose ads-only mode for some of the ads.\n\n7. Try to acquire affiliate videos that have been generating GMV for you and/or have high GPM (GMV per impression) as ad creatives assets. Obtain the video code from the affiliate creator. You can see all affiliate videos that have been generating GMV for you in the affiliate section of Seller Center and directly message the creator from Seller Center via Creator Connect.\n\n8. Try to use as many videos and/or TikTok Shop Product Links as possible under the same VSA ad group budget, ideally with 3-5 active video creatives in each ad group. Use the highest gross revenue and cost cap bid strategies according to preference and experiment with a combination of these two bid strategies. Experiment with using single product links (only one product per ad) and multiple product links (multiple products per ad) to test what works better for your business, as results may vary for different sellers.\n\n9. For the highest gross revenue ad group, keep scaling the budget every week, each time observing the ROAS of the previous 7 days on a rolling basis, and increase or decrease the budget as necessary. For cost cap, we recommend maximizing the budget after the ad has run for more than a day.\n\n10. Besides the 1 official TikTok account connected to your TikTok Shop, you can additionally connect up to 4 more TikTok accounts with your TikTok Shop for marketing purposes. Take advantage of this by differentiating your marketing accounts based on persona categories to cater to different audience preferences, presenting &quot;UGC&quot; style native content. This helps to broaden your interested audiences.\n\n11. If you are running a LIVE Shopping event, we highly recommend running \u30104\u2020Live Shopping Ads\u3011 (LSA), optimizing towards Gross Revenue, and starting with a budget of a few hundred dollars. LIVE Shopping events or LSA may or may not work well for your business. LIVE Shopping performance can be volatile but can work well for some businesses.\n\n12. TikTok Shop does not only offer ads GMV but also trackable organic GMV. It also offers a potentially large pool of &quot;referral&quot; style affiliate creatives that you can use for ads or other purposes.\n\n13. When considering Shop Ads performance, in addition to reviewing Shop Ads ROAS performance, we recommend reviewing overall TikTok Shop marketing ROI, which equates to [Shop total GMV / (Shop Ads ads cost + Shop affiliate commission)]. Consider how much GMV (paid, affiliate, organic) you are getting out of your marketing investment in TikTok Shop. Evaluate your TikTok Shop marketing ROI against your typical marketing ROI targets.\n\nContent Hide content \n\nOur Products\n\n* \u30105\u2020TikTok for Business\u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30106\u2020TikTok\u2020tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30107\u2020Creative Center\u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u00a92024 TikTok For Business \n\n* \u30108\u2020 Terms &amp; Policies \u3011\n* \u30109\u2020 Privacy \u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30100\u2020 Help \u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 10, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1716, "end_ix": 1726, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "TikTok Shopping &amp; Showcase | TikTok For Business", "url": "https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-shopping-and-showcase?lang=it", "text": "\nUna scheda Vetrina dei prodotti pu\u00f2 contenere prodotti delle seguenti opzioni:\n\n  * Tutti i prodotti di un TikTok Shop.\n\n  * Alcuni prodotti di un negozio.\n\n  * Prodotti provenienti da pi\u00f9 negozi.\n\n[Image 1: TikTok Shopping and Showcase-PNG]\n\n## Ecco cosa devi sapere prima di utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina \n\n  1. TikTok Shop e le Presentazioni non sono uguali.\n\n     * Se hai soltanto una Vetrina e non un TikTok Shop, puoi comunque fare pubblicit\u00e0 utilizzando i prodotti nella tua vetrina e fare riferimento a \u30103\u2020Come configurare Video Shopping Ads con Vetrina\u3011.\n\n     * Se scegli Vetrina o TikTok Shop come origine prodotto, l\u2019elenco dei prodotti che possono essere selezionati per la pubblicit\u00e0 cambia di conseguenza.\n\n     * Ricordati che TikTok Shop contiene l\u2019inventario dei prodotti di propriet\u00e0 del venditore. Se vendi i prodotti attraverso un account affiliato o di marketing, \u00e8 possibile che tu possieda un TikTok Shop.\n\n  2. Da notare che non tutti coloro che possiedono una Vetrina hanno un TikTok Shop.\n\n     * Ad esempio, un brand pu\u00f2 concedere a un terzo l\u2019autorizzazione a vendere prodotti a suo nome. Questi prodotti sono visualizzati nella Vetrina del terzo per essere acquistati dai clienti. Un terzo non possiede i prodotti che vende, ma piuttosto vende i prodotti per conto del brand.\n\n## Ecco cosa devi sapere per utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina \n\nPossedere una Vetrina non significa necessariamente possedere un TikTok Shop. Gli esempi che seguono mostrano i diversi scenari che si verificano tra TikTok Shop e Vetrina.\n\n### Esempi \n\n  1. Per un account TikTok ufficiale, tutti i prodotti di un brand verranno automaticamente visualizzati nella loro Vetrina.\n\n  2. Un brand pu\u00f2 consentire agli account commerciali/affiliati di vendere i prodotti per suo conto. La Vetrina degli account commerciali/affiliati visualizzer\u00e0 alcuni o tutti i prodotti di un negozio.\n\n     * Esempio 1: un brand di calzature pu\u00f2 consentire a pi\u00f9 account commerciali, gestiti da terzi, di vendere prodotti a suo nome.\n\n     * Esempio 2: due brand diversi di calzature possono consentire a un account affiliato/di marketing gestito da un importante rivenditore al dettaglio o da uno store specializzato di vendere prodotti per conto di entrambi i brand.\n\n## Come utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina\n\n### Come account TikTok ufficiale \n\nSe sei un account TikTok ufficiale con un TikTok Shop, la tua Vetrina mostrer\u00e0 tutti i tuoi prodotti.\n\n##### Come sono collegati i tuoi prodotti tra TikTok Shop e Vetrina:\n\n  * In Seller Center collega un account TikTok ufficiale. Dopo che il titolare dell\u2019account TikTok ha confermato il link, tutti i prodotti del TikTok Shop vengono automaticamente visualizzati nella Vetrina.\n\n  * Il link dipende dal Paese in cui vende lo shop.

Try to use as many videos and/or TikTok Shop Product Links as possible under the same VSA ad group budget, ideally with 3-5 active video creatives in each ad group. Use the highest gross revenue and cost cap bid strategies according to preference and experiment with a combination of these two bid strategies. Experiment with using single product links (only one product per ad) and multiple product links (multiple products per ad) to test what works better for your business, as results may vary for different sellers.\n\n9. For the highest gross revenue ad group, keep scaling the budget every week, each time observing the ROAS of the previous 7 days on a rolling basis, and increase or decrease the budget as necessary. For cost cap, we recommend maximizing the budget after the ad has run for more than a day.\n\n10. Besides the 1 official TikTok account connected to your TikTok Shop, you can additionally connect up to 4 more TikTok accounts with your TikTok Shop for marketing purposes. Take advantage of this by differentiating your marketing accounts based on persona categories to cater to different audience preferences, presenting &quot;UGC&quot; style native content. This helps to broaden your interested audiences.\n\n11. If you are running a LIVE Shopping event, we highly recommend running \u30104\u2020Live Shopping Ads\u3011 (LSA), optimizing towards Gross Revenue, and starting with a budget of a few hundred dollars. LIVE Shopping events or LSA may or may not work well for your business. LIVE Shopping performance can be volatile but can work well for some businesses.\n\n12. TikTok Shop does not only offer ads GMV but also trackable organic GMV. It also offers a potentially large pool of &quot;referral&quot; style affiliate creatives that you can use for ads or other purposes.\n\n13. When considering Shop Ads performance, in addition to reviewing Shop Ads ROAS performance, we recommend reviewing overall TikTok Shop marketing ROI, which equates to [Shop total GMV / (Shop Ads ads cost + Shop affiliate commission)]. Consider how much GMV (paid, affiliate, organic) you are getting out of your marketing investment in TikTok Shop. Evaluate your TikTok Shop marketing ROI against your typical marketing ROI targets.\n\nContent Hide content \n\nOur Products\n\n* \u30105\u2020TikTok for Business\u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30106\u2020TikTok\u2020tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30107\u2020Creative Center\u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u00a92024 TikTok For Business \n\n* \u30108\u2020 Terms &amp; Policies \u3011\n* \u30109\u2020 Privacy \u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30100\u2020 Help \u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1384, "end_idx": 1394, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "TikTok Shopping &amp; Showcase | TikTok For Business", "url": "https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-shopping-and-showcase?lang=it", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nUna scheda Vetrina dei prodotti pu\u00f2 contenere prodotti delle seguenti opzioni:\n\n  * Tutti i prodotti di un TikTok Shop.\n\n  * Alcuni prodotti di un negozio.\n\n  * Prodotti provenienti da pi\u00f9 negozi.\n\n[Image 1: TikTok Shopping and Showcase-PNG]\n\n## Ecco cosa devi sapere prima di utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina \n\n  1.

Maximize the products uploaded to TikTok Shop (TTS). Do not only upload your bestselling products or products that you believe will sell well on TikTok Shop. We strongly recommend uploading all products available to help increase exposure among potential shoppers.\n\n2. Maximize the number of Shoppable Video posts on your TikTok account. Do not only upload videos that have performed well on other platforms or that you believe will perform well on TikTok. Uploading videos on TikTok requires no additional costs. We strongly recommend posting as many videos as possible on your TikTok account to help increase exposure among potential shoppers.\n\n3. Add TikTok Shop Product Link (the little orange cart) to all relevant videos on your TikTok account. While it is best practice to ensure the linked product matches the video content, it is more important to have a TikTok Shop Product Link on as many video posts as possible.\n\n4. Participate in the open affiliate plan. You may participate in the targeted plan if you are already familiar with creators and have an existing creator pipeline. Tips on commission rate: If no benchmarks have been set before, we recommend starting with a 10% commission rate, and gradually reducing it to 5% or 1% as your TikTok Shop GMV grows.\n\n5. Start with \u30103\u2020Video Shopping Ads\u3011 (VSA) for TikTok Shop, prioritizing existing videos from your TikTok account that have already generated organic conversions (Spark Ads). Note that when using an existing video as an asset for Video Shopping Ads, the Video Shopping Ads will use the products chosen during ad creation in the ad link. You can choose to advertise the same or different list of products for the Video Shopping Ads vs. the organic link. You can even run a Video Shopping Ads with an existing video that has no organic link.\n\n6. If using new videos as an asset for Video Shopping Ads through TikTok Ads Manager (not using Spark Ads), we recommend posting the video with the TikTok Shop Product Link on your TikTok account first, unless you are testing multiple variations of video captions, for which you may choose ads-only mode for some of the ads.\n\n7. Try to acquire affiliate videos that have been generating GMV for you and/or have high GPM (GMV per impression) as ad creatives assets. Obtain the video code from the affiliate creator. You can see all affiliate videos that have been generating GMV for you in the affiliate section of Seller Center and directly message the creator from Seller Center via Creator Connect.\n\n8. Try to use as many videos and/or TikTok Shop Product Links as possible under the same VSA ad group budget, ideally with 3-5 active video creatives in each ad group. Use the highest gross revenue and cost cap bid strategies according to preference and experiment with a combination of these two bid strategies. Experiment with using single product links (only one product per ad) and multiple product links (multiple products per ad) to test what works better for your business, as results may vary for different sellers.\n\n9. For the highest gross revenue ad group, keep scaling the budget every week, each time observing the ROAS of the previous 7 days on a rolling basis, and increase or decrease the budget as necessary. For cost cap, we recommend maximizing the budget after the ad has run for more than a day.\n\n10. Besides the 1 official TikTok account connected to your TikTok Shop, you can additionally connect up to 4 more TikTok accounts with your TikTok Shop for marketing purposes. Take advantage of this by differentiating your marketing accounts based on persona categories to cater to different audience preferences, presenting &quot;UGC&quot; style native content. This helps to broaden your interested audiences.\n\n11. If you are running a LIVE Shopping event, we highly recommend running \u30104\u2020Live Shopping Ads\u3011 (LSA), optimizing towards Gross Revenue, and starting with a budget of a few hundred dollars. LIVE Shopping events or LSA may or may not work well for your business. LIVE Shopping performance can be volatile but can work well for some businesses.\n\n12. TikTok Shop does not only offer ads GMV but also trackable organic GMV. It also offers a potentially large pool of &quot;referral&quot; style affiliate creatives that you can use for ads or other purposes.\n\n13. When considering Shop Ads performance, in addition to reviewing Shop Ads ROAS performance, we recommend reviewing overall TikTok Shop marketing ROI, which equates to [Shop total GMV / (Shop Ads ads cost + Shop affiliate commission)]. Consider how much GMV (paid, affiliate, organic) you are getting out of your marketing investment in TikTok Shop. Evaluate your TikTok Shop marketing ROI against your typical marketing ROI targets.\n\nContent Hide content \n\nOur Products\n\n* \u30105\u2020TikTok for Business\u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30106\u2020TikTok\u2020tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30107\u2020Creative Center\u3011\n\n\u30100\u2020 \u3011 \n\n\u00a92024 TikTok For Business \n\n* \u30108\u2020 Terms &amp; Policies \u3011\n* \u30109\u2020 Privacy \u2020www.tiktok.com\u3011\n* \u30100\u2020 Help \u3011\nVisible: 0% - 100%"}, {"matched_text": "\u30109\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1716, "end_idx": 1726, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "TikTok Shopping &amp; Showcase | TikTok For Business", "url": "https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/tiktok-shopping-and-showcase?lang=it", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nUna scheda Vetrina dei prodotti pu\u00f2 contenere prodotti delle seguenti opzioni:\n\n  * Tutti i prodotti di un TikTok Shop.\n\n  * Alcuni prodotti di un negozio.\n\n  * Prodotti provenienti da pi\u00f9 negozi.\n\n[Image 1: TikTok Shopping and Showcase-PNG]\n\n## Ecco cosa devi sapere prima di utilizzare TikTok Shop e Vetrina \n\n  1.

It was introduced in 2009 as part of an EU directive to make Europe a more appealing destination for qualified professionals from outside the EU, especially in fields like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Eligibility**: To qualify for the EU Blue Card, applicants must:\n   - Hold a higher education degree or have equivalent professional qualifications.\n   - Have a job offer or employment contract in an EU member state that meets a certain salary threshold (which varies depending on the country and sector).\n   - Prove that the job requires high-level skills.\n\n2. **Validity**: The Blue Card is typically valid for 1 to 4 years, depending on the length of the job contract. It can be renewed and eventually lead to permanent residency in some cases.\n\n3. **Benefits**:\n   - Allows the holder to live and work in an EU member state (except Denmark and Ireland, which don\u2019t participate).\n   - Facilitates family reunification, as family members can accompany the Blue Card holder.\n   - Provides the right to travel freely within the Schengen Area.\n   - After 18 months, Blue Card holders can move to another EU country to take up a similar job.\n\n4. **Path to Permanent Residency**: Blue Card holders can apply for permanent residency after a certain period, generally around five years of continuous residence in an EU member state.\n\n### Is it Legit?\nYes, the EU Blue Card is a fully recognized and legal program in the EU. It&#x27;s part of the EU&#x27;s effort to attract highly skilled workers and fill labor shortages in certain industries. However, the program&#x27;s specific implementation and requirements can vary by country, as each EU nation sets its own salary thresholds and processing rules."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "4746bb95-44bb-4a7e-9a74-79e34290d2f1", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8d7b27ea5f7b4c5d-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4746bb95-44bb-4a7e-9a74-79e34290d2f1", "children": ["aaa2a962-42fd-4fc4-af17-79de2a03273a"]}, "aaa2a962-42fd-4fc4-af17-79de2a03273a": {"id": "aaa2a962-42fd-4fc4-af17-79de2a03273a", "message": {"id": "aaa2a962-42fd-4fc4-af17-79de2a03273a", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729785444.920091, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["how long does the process usually take and if i don&#x27;t have a job offer yet does that mean i shouldnt apply?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8d7b2994baf90e45-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ed17b0bb-e92b-4113-b1ac-06df569a3c6e", "children": ["3a662d83-31b1-4125-97da-4ba6ca2bbbb7"]}, "3a662d83-31b1-4125-97da-4ba6ca2bbbb7": {"id": "3a662d83-31b1-4125-97da-4ba6ca2bbbb7", "message": {"id": "3a662d83-31b1-4125-97da-4ba6ca2bbbb7", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729785470.877577, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The EU Blue Card application process can vary depending on the country where you\u2019re applying, but in general, it can take anywhere from **2 to 6 months** to complete. This includes the time needed for the employer to process the work contract, for authorities to assess the application, and for any additional administrative procedures (like background checks or document verification).\n\n### Steps and Timelines:\n1. **Securing a Job Offer**: The most important and time-consuming part is often finding a job offer that meets the Blue Card requirements. The job offer must be from an employer in an EU member state that is part of the Blue Card system, and the position must meet salary and skills criteria. Without this, you **cannot apply for the Blue Card**, as the job offer is mandatory.\n   \n2. **Application Submission**: Once you have a job offer, the submission of the application can usually be done by either you or your employer. Required documents typically include your employment contract, proof of qualifications, passport, and health insurance.\n   \n3. **Processing**: After submitting the application, the processing time varies by country. In some EU countries, it may take around **4 to 12 weeks** (1 to 3 months) to process, while in others it can be longer, depending on the volume of applications and how efficiently the authorities handle the process.\n\n### Can You Apply Without a Job Offer?\nNo, you **cannot apply** for an EU Blue Card without a job offer that meets the program&#x27;s requirements. The Blue Card is job-specific, meaning you must have an offer of employment in an EU country that sponsors your application. If you don\u2019t have a job offer yet, the focus should be on finding an employer who is willing to hire you and sponsor your Blue Card application.\n\n### What Should You Do if You Don&#x27;t Have a Job Offer?\n1. **Job Search**: Look for job opportunities that match your skills and are willing to sponsor an EU Blue Card. Many companies post job listings specifically mentioning their willingness to sponsor candidates for the Blue Card.\n   \n2. **Networking**: Reach out to recruitment agencies and employers in your field within the EU, attend virtual job fairs, and use platforms like LinkedIn to connect with potential employers.\n   \n3. **Job Portals**: Check out job search portals that cater specifically to highly skilled professionals looking to work in the EU, such as **EURES**, which lists jobs across the EU, including positions where Blue Card sponsorship is available.\n\nIf you do not have a job offer yet, focus on that step before proceeding with the application process."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "aaa2a962-42fd-4fc4-af17-79de2a03273a", "request_id": "8d7b2994baf90e45-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2a962-42fd-4fc4-af17-79de2a03273a", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "3a662d83-31b1-4125-97da-4ba6ca2bbbb7", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "671a6e20-7ff4-8006-a462-bdbe7fffc45e", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "671a6e20-7ff4-8006-a462-bdbe7fffc45e"}, {"title": "Operations Manager Job Application", "create_time": 1729777185.792554, "update_time": 1729781644.775431, "mapping": {"14b5c91b-e54b-43eb-b2e6-1ae8fb0b8a86": {"id": "14b5c91b-e54b-43eb-b2e6-1ae8fb0b8a86", "message": {"id": "14b5c91b-e54b-43eb-b2e6-1ae8fb0b8a86", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa1e49d-5d4a-4151-b0e5-ac837b2170df", "children": ["eee7334e-499c-4fc9-9fc6-ef651601360a"]}, "aaa1e49d-5d4a-4151-b0e5-ac837b2170df": {"id": "aaa1e49d-5d4a-4151-b0e5-ac837b2170df", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["14b5c91b-e54b-43eb-b2e6-1ae8fb0b8a86"]}, "eee7334e-499c-4fc9-9fc6-ef651601360a": {"id": "eee7334e-499c-4fc9-9fc6-ef651601360a", "message": {"id": "eee7334e-499c-4fc9-9fc6-ef651601360a", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"attachments": [{"id": "file-uhbiIUFnwZsUr7bmoFndgD45", "name": "achivement resume.docx", "mimeType": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "fileSizeTokens": null}], "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "14b5c91b-e54b-43eb-b2e6-1ae8fb0b8a86", "children": ["aaa21434-b581-4221-bcd6-ae61fb5d5bf5"]}, "aaa21434-b581-4221-bcd6-ae61fb5d5bf5": {"id": "aaa21434-b581-4221-bcd6-ae61fb5d5bf5", "message": {"id": "aaa21434-b581-4221-bcd6-ae61fb5d5bf5", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1729777185.817651, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Operations Manager\r\nApply Now\r\nShare this job\r\n\r\nShare Operations Manager with a friend via e-mail Share Operations Manager with Facebook Share Operations Manager with Twitter Share Operations Manager with LinkedIn Share Operations Manager with Xing Share Operations Manager with Whatsapp Copy Operations Manager to Clipboard\r\nBasic Information\r\nRef Number  Req_00144874 Last day to apply  30-Nov-2024 Primary Location  BG -

The cross of peace is the burden of the courageous.&quot;[ 5 ] Meanwhile, Lebanon asked the United States, France, and Italy to double the size of the peacekeeping force. As of March 16, it numbered about 4,800 troops, including some 1,200 US Marines, 1,400 Italian soldiers, 2,100 French paratroopers and 100 British soldiers. \n\n\u3010103\u2020Iran\u3011 denied any role in the attack.

But it attached an amendment to the bill that would force the White House to seek approval for any expanded US military role. \n\nThe \u3010110\u2020Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u3011 followed suit April 20, approving the aid request but attaching an amendment that required the president to obtain congressional authorization for &quot;any substantial expansion in the number or role of US armed forces in Lebanon or for the creation of a new, expanded or extended multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon.&quot; If Congress did not act jointly on such a request within 60 days, however, the increase would then take effect automatically. \n\nThe Senate amendment was sponsored as a compromise by the committee&#x27;s chairman, Republican \u3010111\u2020Charles H. Percy\u3011 of Illinois. It prevented a move by the committee&#x27;s ranking Democrat, \u3010112\u2020Claiborne Pell\u3011 of Rhode Island, to extend the 1973 \u3010113\u2020War Powers Resolution\u3011 to Lebanon.

The cross of peace is the burden of the courageous.&quot;[ 5 ] Meanwhile, Lebanon asked the United States, France, and Italy to double the size of the peacekeeping force. As of March 16, it numbered about 4,800 troops, including some 1,200 US Marines, 1,400 Italian soldiers, 2,100 French paratroopers and 100 British soldiers. \n\n\u3010103\u2020Iran\u3011 denied any role in the attack.

I think the lesson is simple and understood. The security problems in Lebanon are still most serious, and terrorist organizations will continue to operate there, at times with great success.&quot;[ 5 ]\n\n## U.S. economic aid\n\n[\u3010108\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nThe \u3010109\u2020House Foreign Affairs Committee\u3011 April 19 voted to approve $251 million in additional economic and military aid for Lebanon, as requested by the administration. But it attached an amendment to the bill that would force the White House to seek approval for any expanded US military role. \n\nThe \u3010110\u2020Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u3011 followed suit April 20, approving the aid request but attaching an amendment that required the president to obtain congressional authorization for &quot;any substantial expansion in the number or role of US armed forces in Lebanon or for the creation of a new, expanded or extended multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon.&quot; If Congress did not act jointly on such a request within 60 days, however, the increase would then take effect automatically. \n\nThe Senate amendment was sponsored as a compromise by the committee&#x27;s chairman, Republican \u3010111\u2020Charles H. Percy\u3011 of Illinois. It prevented a move by the committee&#x27;s ranking Democrat, \u3010112\u2020Claiborne Pell\u3011 of Rhode Island, to extend the 1973 \u3010113\u2020War Powers Resolution\u3011 to Lebanon. On April 20, Pell said he would have had the votes to apply the resolution to US Marines in Lebanon. The law limited presidential commitment of troops in hostile situations to a maximum of 90 days unless Congress specifically approved their use. \n\nDeputy Secretary of State \u3010114\u2020Kenneth W. Dam\u3011, in a letter to the committee, had argued forcefully against use of the War Powers Resolution. Dam said it would &quot;amount to a public finding that US forces will be exposed to imminent risk of involvement in hostilities&quot;, which &quot;could give entirely the wrong public impression&quot; of US expectations for Lebanon&#x27;s future. Several influential congressmen had been urging an end to the US military role in Lebanon. After the embassy bombing, April 19, Republican Senator \u3010115\u2020Barry Goldwater\u3011 of Arizona said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s high time we bring the boys home.&quot; \n\n## Aftermath\n\n[\u3010116\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * \u3010117\u2020v\u3011\n  * \u3010118\u2020t\u3011\n  * \u3010119\u2020e\u3011\n\n\u301069\u2020Lebanese Civil War\u3011  \n\nFirst phase: 1975\u20131977  \n\n  * \u3010120\u2020Bus massacre\u3011\n  * \u3010121\u2020Black Thursday\u3011\n  * \u3010122\u2020Battle of the Hotels\u3011\n  * \u3010123\u2020ASALA insurgency\u3011\n  * \u3010124\u2020Black Saturday\u3011\n  * \u3010125\u2020Karantina massacre\u3011\n  * \u3010126\u2020Damour massa", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 29, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}, {"start_ix": 1299, "end_ix": 1310, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "1983 Beirut barracks bombings - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Beirut_barracks_bombings", "text": "\n    10 September 1982 \u2013 The PLO retreats from Beirut under MNF protection.

This animosity was made worse by the \u3010290\u2020Phalangist\u3011, a right-wing, largely Maronite-Lebanese militia force closely associated with President Gemayel. The Phalangist militia was responsible for multiple, bloody attacks against the Muslim and Druze communities in Lebanon and for the 1982 atrocities committed in the PLO refugee camps, \u3010232\u2020Sabra and Shatila\u3011 by \u3010291\u2020Lebanese Forces\u3011 (LF), while the IDF provided security and looked on.[ 24 ][ 25 ]\n\nThe Phalangist militia&#x27;s attacks on Sabra and Shatila were purportedly a response to the September 14, 1982, assassination of President-elect Bachir Gemayel.[ 24 ][ 26 ][ 27 ] \u3010280\u2020Amine Gemayel\u3011, Bachir&#x27;s brother, succeeded Bachir as the elected president of Lebanon, and Amine continued to represent and advance Maronite interests. \n\nAll of this, according to British foreign correspondent \u3010292\u2020Robert Fisk\u3011, served to generate ill will against the MNF among Lebanese Muslims and especially among the \u3010293\u2020Shiites\u3011 living in the slums of West Beirut. Lebanese Muslims believed the MNF, and the Americans in particular, were unfairly siding with the Maronite Christians in their attempt to dominate Lebanon.[ 28 ][ 29 ][ 30 ] As a result, this led to artillery, mortar, and small arms fire being directed at MNF peacekeepers by Muslim factions.

After he played a key role as commander of the army in resolving the crisis of a 1958 rebellion, the newly elected president \u3010100\u2020Fuad Chehab\u3011 made a valiant attempt to address the disproportionate development of the country and to centralize the state\u2019s security apparatus. By the late 1960s, however, the development program he initiated proved politically unsatisfactory and had become a destabilizing force. The strengthened security apparatus, meanwhile, gained a reputation for suppression and corruption. The situation grew more \u3010101\u2020precarious\u3011 as the government negotiated the presence and operation of PLO guerrillas inside Lebanon\u2019s Palestinian refugee camps, which had attracted Israeli raids on Lebanon, most notably on the airport in \u3010102\u2020Beirut\u3011 in 1968. As the state proved increasingly unable to maintain a monopoly of force, patronage networks, both existing and new, began arming and organizing their own security.\n\n\u301061\u2020 Britannica Quiz A History of War \u3011\n\nOn August 17, 1970, \u3010103\u2020Suleiman Franjieh\u3011, leader of a powerful Maronite clan from northern Lebanon who sought to undo the reform program initiated by Chehab, was elected president by one vote after three rounds of balloting. His presidency, polarizing and corrupt, alienated Muslims and Christians alike, and his government proved unable to maintain the state\u2019s dominance over the growing and diffuse militias of the PLO. The Phalangist militia of the rival Maronite \u3010104\u2020Gemayel clan\u3011 began taking matters into its own hands by confronting the Palestinian militias directly.\n\n## Progression of the war\n\nThe beginning of the civil war is typically dated to April 13, 1975, when the Phalangists attacked a bus taking Palestinians to a refugee camp at \u3010105\u2020Tall al-Za\u02bftar\u3011, Lebanon. The attack escalated an \u3010106\u2020intermittent\u2020www.merriam-webster.com\u3011 cycle of violence into a more general battle between the Phalangists and the LNM, whose coalition of Lebanese leftists and Muslims supported the PLO\u2019s cause.\n\nIn the months that followed, the general destruction of the central market area of Beirut was marked by the emergence of a \u201cgreen line\u201d between Muslim West Beirut and Christian East Beirut, which persisted until the end of the civil war in 1990, with each side under the control of its respective militias.\n\nAs Franjieh\u2019s term came to an end, and with Lebanon\u2019s army splintered, he asked Syria to intervene to prevent the country from disintegrating into multiple states. Despite its earlier support for the PLO in the south, Syria launched a large-scale intervention to \u3010107\u2020redress\u3011 the emerging imbalance of power in favour of the Christians in the north. Syria\u2019s intervention sparked a more active Israeli involvement as well, in which Israel armed and financed Christian militias in the south of the country, whom Israelis looked upon as their", "pub_date": null, "extra": {"cited_message_idx": 28, "search_result_idx": null, "evidence_text": "source", "cloud_doc_url": null}}}], "content_references": [{"matched_text": "\u301030\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 625, "end_idx": 636, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "Beirut barracks blown up", "url": "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/beirut-barracks-blown-up", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nIn 1975, a bloody civil war erupted in Lebanon, with Palestinian and leftist Muslim guerrillas battling militias of the Christian Phalange Party, the Maronite Christian community, and other groups. During the next few years, Syrian, Israeli, and United Nations interventions failed to resolve the factional fighting, and on August 20, 1982, a multinational force including 800 U.S. Marines was ordered to Beirut to help coordinate the Palestinian withdrawal.\n\nThe Marines left Lebanese territory on September 10 but returned in strengthened numbers on September 29, following the massacre of Palestinian refugees by a Christian militia. The next day, the first U.S. Marine to die during the mission was killed while defusing a bomb. Other Marines fell prey to snipers. On April 18, 1983, a suicide bomber driving a van devastated the U.S. embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans. Then, on October 23, a Lebanese terrorist plowed his bomb-laden truck through three guard posts, a barbed-wire fence, and into the lobby of the Marines Corps headquarters in Beirut, where he detonated a massive bomb, killing 241 marine, navy, and army personnel. The bomb, which was made of a sophisticated explosive enhanced by gas, had an explosive power equivalent to 18,000 pounds of dynamite. The identities of the embassy and barracks bombers were not determined, but they were suspected to be Shiite terrorists associated with Iran.\n\nAfter the barracks bombing, many questioned whether President \u301020\u2020Ronald Reagan\u3011 had a solid policy aim in Lebanon. Serious questions also arose over the quality of security in the American sector of war-torn Beirut. The U.S. peacekeeping force occupied an exposed area near the airport, but for political reasons the marine commander had not been allowed to maintain a completely secure perimeter before the attack. In a national address on October 23, President Reagan vowed to keep the marines in Lebanon, but just four months later he announced the end of the American role in the peacekeeping force. On February 26, 1984, the main force of marines left Lebanon, leaving just a small contingent to guard the U.S. embassy in Beirut.\n\nBy: \u301021\u2020History.com Editors\u3011\n\n\u301022\u2020HISTORY.com\u2020history.com\u3011 works with a wide range of writers and editors to create accurate and informative content.

The cross of peace is the burden of the courageous.&quot;[ 5 ] Meanwhile, Lebanon asked the United States, France, and Italy to double the size of the peacekeeping force. As of March 16, it numbered about 4,800 troops, including some 1,200 US Marines, 1,400 Italian soldiers, 2,100 French paratroopers and 100 British soldiers. \n\n\u3010103\u2020Iran\u3011 denied any role in the attack. Foreign Minister, \u3010104\u2020Ali Akbar Velayati\u3011 said, &quot;We deny any involvement and we think this allegation is another propaganda plot against us.&quot;[ 7 ]\n\nOn April 19, Prime Minister \u3010105\u2020Menachem Begin\u3011 of Israel sent President Reagan a message of condolence for the embassy bombing. &quot;I write in the name of Israel when I express to you my deep shock at the terrible outrage which took the lives of so many of the American embassy in Beirut yesterday.&quot;[ 5 ] Defense Minister \u3010106\u2020Moshe Arens\u3011, was quoted by Israeli radio that he told the cabinet the attack &quot;justified Israel&#x27;s demands for security arrangements in Lebanon.&quot; Minister \u3010107\u2020Yitzhak Shamir\u3011 of Israel called the embassy bombing &quot;shocking&quot; but added that, &quot;In Lebanon nothing is surprising. I think the lesson is simple and understood. The security problems in Lebanon are still most serious, and terrorist organizations will continue to operate there, at times with great success.&quot;[ 5 ]\n\n## U.S. economic aid\n\n[\u3010108\u2020edit\u3011]\n\nThe \u3010109\u2020House Foreign Affairs Committee\u3011 April 19 voted to approve $251 million in additional economic and military aid for Lebanon, as requested by the administration. But it attached an amendment to the bill that would force the White House to seek approval for any expanded US military role. \n\nThe \u3010110\u2020Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u3011 followed suit April 20, approving the aid request but attaching an amendment that required the president to obtain congressional authorization for &quot;any substantial expansion in the number or role of US armed forces in Lebanon or for the creation of a new, expanded or extended multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon.&quot; If Congress did not act jointly on such a request within 60 days, however, the increase would then take effect automatically. \n\nThe Senate amendment was sponsored as a compromise by the committee&#x27;s chairman, Republican \u3010111\u2020Charles H. Percy\u3011 of Illinois. It prevented a move by the committee&#x27;s ranking Democrat, \u3010112\u2020Claiborne Pell\u3011 of Rhode Island, to extend the 1973 \u3010113\u2020War Powers Resolution\u3011 to Lebanon. On April 20, Pell said he would have had the votes to apply the resolution to US Marines in Lebanon. The law limited presidential commitment of troops in hostile situations to a maximum of 90 days unless Congress specifically approved their use. \n\nDeputy Secretary of State \u3010114\u2020Kenneth W. Dam\u3011, in a letter to the committee, had argued forcefully against use of the War Powers Resolution. Dam said it would &quot;amount to a public finding that US forces will be exposed to imminent risk of involvement in hostilities&quot;, which &quot;could give entirely the wrong public impression&quot; of US expectations for Lebanon&#x27;s future. Several influential congressmen had been urging an end to the US military role in Lebanon. After the embassy bombing, April 19, Republican Senator \u3010115\u2020Barry Goldwater\u3011 of Arizona said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s high time we bring the boys home.&quot; \n\n## Aftermath\n\n[\u3010116\u2020edit\u3011]\n\n  * \u3010117\u2020v\u3011\n  * \u3010118\u2020t\u3011\n  * \u3010119\u2020e\u3011\n\n\u301069\u2020Lebanese Civil War\u3011  \n\nFirst phase: 1975\u20131977  \n\n  * \u3010120\u2020Bus massacre\u3011\n  * \u3010121\u2020Black Thursday\u3011\n  * \u3010122\u2020Battle of the Hotels\u3011\n  * \u3010123\u2020ASALA insurgency\u3011\n  * \u3010124\u2020Black Saturday\u3011\n  * \u3010125\u2020Karantina massacre\u3011\n  * \u3010126\u2020Damour massa"}, {"matched_text": "\u301025\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1299, "end_idx": 1310, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "1983 Beirut barracks bombings - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Beirut_barracks_bombings", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\n    10 September 1982 \u2013 The PLO retreats from Beirut under MNF protection.

This animosity was made worse by the \u3010290\u2020Phalangist\u3011, a right-wing, largely Maronite-Lebanese militia force closely associated with President Gemayel. The Phalangist militia was responsible for multiple, bloody attacks against the Muslim and Druze communities in Lebanon and for the 1982 atrocities committed in the PLO refugee camps, \u3010232\u2020Sabra and Shatila\u3011 by \u3010291\u2020Lebanese Forces\u3011 (LF), while the IDF provided security and looked on.[ 24 ][ 25 ]\n\nThe Phalangist militia&#x27;s attacks on Sabra and Shatila were purportedly a response to the September 14, 1982, assassination of President-elect Bachir Gemayel.[ 24 ][ 26 ][ 27 ] \u3010280\u2020Amine Gemayel\u3011, Bachir&#x27;s brother, succeeded Bachir as the elected president of Lebanon, and Amine continued to represent and advance Maronite interests. \n\nAll of this, according to British foreign correspondent \u3010292\u2020Robert Fisk\u3011, served to generate ill will against the MNF among Lebanese Muslims and especially among the \u3010293\u2020Shiites\u3011 living in the slums of West Beirut. Lebanese Muslims believed the MNF, and the Americans in particular, were unfairly siding with the Maronite Christians in their attempt to dominate Lebanon.[ 28 ][ 29 ][ 30 ] As a result, this led to artillery, mortar, and small arms fire being directed at MNF peacekeepers by Muslim factions.

After he played a key role as commander of the army in resolving the crisis of a 1958 rebellion, the newly elected president \u3010100\u2020Fuad Chehab\u3011 made a valiant attempt to address the disproportionate development of the country and to centralize the state\u2019s security apparatus. By the late 1960s, however, the development program he initiated proved politically unsatisfactory and had become a destabilizing force. The strengthened security apparatus, meanwhile, gained a reputation for suppression and corruption. The situation grew more \u3010101\u2020precarious\u3011 as the government negotiated the presence and operation of PLO guerrillas inside Lebanon\u2019s Palestinian refugee camps, which had attracted Israeli raids on Lebanon, most notably on the airport in \u3010102\u2020Beirut\u3011 in 1968. As the state proved increasingly unable to maintain a monopoly of force, patronage networks, both existing and new, began arming and organizing their own security.\n\n\u301061\u2020 Britannica Quiz A History of War \u3011\n\nOn August 17, 1970, \u3010103\u2020Suleiman Franjieh\u3011, leader of a powerful Maronite clan from northern Lebanon who sought to undo the reform program initiated by Chehab, was elected president by one vote after three rounds of balloting. His presidency, polarizing and corrupt, alienated Muslims and Christians alike, and his government proved unable to maintain the state\u2019s dominance over the growing and diffuse militias of the PLO. The Phalangist militia of the rival Maronite \u3010104\u2020Gemayel clan\u3011 began taking matters into its own hands by confronting the Palestinian militias directly.\n\n## Progression of the war\n\nThe beginning of the civil war is typically dated to April 13, 1975, when the Phalangists attacked a bus taking Palestinians to a refugee camp at \u3010105\u2020Tall al-Za\u02bftar\u3011, Lebanon. The attack escalated an \u3010106\u2020intermittent\u2020www.merriam-webster.com\u3011 cycle of violence into a more general battle between the Phalangists and the LNM, whose coalition of Lebanese leftists and Muslims supported the PLO\u2019s cause.\n\nIn the months that followed, the general destruction of the central market area of Beirut was marked by the emergence of a \u201cgreen line\u201d between Muslim West Beirut and Christian East Beirut, which persisted until the end of the civil war in 1990, with each side under the control of its respective militias.\n\nAs Franjieh\u2019s term came to an end, and with Lebanon\u2019s army splintered, he asked Syria to intervene to prevent the country from disintegrating into multiple states. Despite its earlier support for the PLO in the south, Syria launched a large-scale intervention to \u3010107\u2020redress\u3011 the emerging imbalance of power in favour of the Christians in the north. Syria\u2019s intervention sparked a more active Israeli involvement as well, in which Israel armed and financed Christian militias in the south of the country, whom Israelis looked upon as their"}], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAA", "parent_id": "2a9beb18-44e9-47ee-a290-827c9f6871bf", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8cb3ce3dab260e27-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "2a9beb18-44e9-47ee-a290-827c9f6871bf", "children": ["3cea2bc2-9168-4618-8e79-f4841f0533d2"]}, "3cea2bc2-9168-4618-8e79-f4841f0533d2": {"id": "3cea2bc2-9168-4618-8e79-f4841f0533d2", "message": {"id": "3cea2bc2-9168-4618-8e79-f4841f0533d2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727695171.385269, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Can you make me a picture of a map clearly defining where lebanon, yemen, iran and palestine are in realation to israel?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8cb3d182e8c95232-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "69720d05-6256-42c8-81dd-305f0d6c4098", "children": ["6c2502f9-7a03-40c8-b093-474c1b4081cd"]}, "6c2502f9-7a03-40c8-b093-474c1b4081cd": {"id": "6c2502f9-7a03-40c8-b093-474c1b4081cd", "message": {"id": "6c2502f9-7a03-40c8-b093-474c1b4081cd", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727695209.896711, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{&quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;A detailed political map showcasing the Middle East, highlighting Lebanon, Yemen, Iran, Palestine, and Israel.

Here&#x27;s why:\n\n1. **Hip Alignment**: If one of your hips is higher than the other (a condition sometimes called pelvic obliquity), it can cause a chain reaction in your lower body alignment. This unevenness can lead to compensations in how you stand, walk, and bear weight, potentially putting extra strain on muscles, tendons, and joints, especially on one side of the body.\n\n2. **Heel Pain**: Heel pain, especially if it\u2019s on the same side as the higher hip, could be a result of this misalignment. The uneven pressure can affect the way you distribute weight through your feet, potentially causing irritation in the structures of the foot, including the plantar fascia or Achilles tendon. This could lead to the kind of heel pain you&#x27;re describing.\n\n3. **Ankle Pain**: The sharp pain you&#x27;re feeling in the divot area between your ankle bone and tendon may relate to how the alignment of your hips and legs is altering the mechanics of your ankle. It could be due to tension or irritation in the tendons (like the peroneal tendons) or small nerves in that area, which might be more vulnerable when sitting if your foot is at rest in a particular position.\n\n4. **Referred Pain**: It&#x27;s possible that the pain in your hip and the sharp pains in your ankle are interconnected. The body often compensates for misalignments in one area by shifting strain to other areas, which can cause pain that may seem disconnected but is part of a broader issue of misalignment or muscular imbalance.\n\nYou might benefit from seeing a specialist (e.g., a physical therapist) who can assess your alignment and help correct any imbalances. Addressing the hip alignment could potentially reduce the strain you&#x27;re feeling in your foot and ankle. If the pain worsens or persists, it would be wise to have imaging done to rule out more serious issues. \n\nWould you like more details on exercises or strategies that could help with the pain?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "c76daa08-7d4f-48d5-a62b-1a3b4642f58f", "request_id": "8c9fbf77fc190e49-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c76daa08-7d4f-48d5-a62b-1a3b4642f58f", "children": ["5c9766d7-e0eb-4d2c-9171-c00a2cb66de2"]}, "5c9766d7-e0eb-4d2c-9171-c00a2cb66de2": {"id": "5c9766d7-e0eb-4d2c-9171-c00a2cb66de2", "message": {"id": "5c9766d7-e0eb-4d2c-9171-c00a2cb66de2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727484840.074401, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Ues, especially that hip bain as i think its sciatic.

Sciatica occurs when the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down to your legs, becomes irritated or compressed. This could be related to the misalignment you&#x27;ve mentioned, as pelvic issues can sometimes affect the lower back and the nerves running through that area. Here are some strategies and exercises that might help with sciatica and hip pain:\n\n### 1. **Stretches for Sciatica Relief:**\n   - **Piriformis Stretch**: This stretch targets the piriformis muscle, which lies close to the sciatic nerve and can contribute to irritation.  \n     - Sit on the floor with your legs extended.\n     - Cross your left leg over the right, placing your foot flat on the floor.\n     - Gently twist your body to the left, using your right elbow to press against your left knee.\n     - Hold for 20-30 seconds, then switch sides.\n   \n   - **Child\u2019s Pose**: A gentle yoga stretch to relieve tension in the lower back and hips.\n     - Start on your hands and knees, then slowly lower your hips back toward your heels while extending your arms forward.\n     - Rest your forehead on the ground and take deep breaths, holding for 30-60 seconds.\n\n   - **Knee-to-Chest Stretch**: This helps release tension in the lower back and glutes.\n     - Lie on your back with your knees bent.\n     - Bring one knee up to your chest, holding it with both hands while keeping the other foot flat on the floor.\n     - Hold for 20-30 seconds, then switch legs.\n\n### 2. **Strengthening Exercises:**\n   Strengthening the muscles around your hips and core can provide better support for your lower back, reducing strain on the sciatic nerve.\n   - **Glute Bridges**:\n     - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.\n     - Push through your heels to lift your hips toward the ceiling while squeezing your glutes.\n     - Hold for a few seconds at the top and then lower back down. Repeat 10-15 times.\n\n   - **Pelvic Tilts**:\n     - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat.\n     - Tighten your abdominal muscles and flatten your lower back against the floor.\n     - Hold for a few seconds, then release. Do 10-15 repetitions.\n\n### 3. **Foam Rolling and Massage:**\n   Using a foam roller to target tight areas around your hips and glutes can relieve pressure on the sciatic nerve. Roll gently over your lower back, glutes, and hamstrings, focusing on any areas of tension. If you feel a trigger point, pause on that area for a few seconds to release the tension.\n\n### 4. **Posture Adjustments:**\n   Since misalignment in the hips can contribute to nerve compression, improving your posture when sitting and standing can help. \n   - Try sitting on a cushion or lumbar support to keep your spine aligned.\n   - When standing, distribute your weight evenly on both feet and avoid slouching.\n\n### 5. **Heat and Ice Therapy:**\n   Applying a cold compress to the painful area for 15-20 minutes can reduce inflammation. Afterward, using a heating pad can help relax tense muscles. Alternate between ice and heat therapy to manage pain and inflammation.\n\n### 6. **Consult a Physical Therapist:**\n   If these home exercises don\u2019t alleviate your symptoms, or if the pain worsens, it\u2019s a good idea to see a physical therapist. They can develop a customized program to address your specific alignment issues, targeting both the hip misalignment and sciatica-related pain.\n\nThese exercises should help relieve the pressure on your sciatic nerve and reduce hip and thigh pain over time. If any exercises aggravate your pain, stop and consult with a professional."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "49f44ac6-3484-4fda-9dd2-c50ec03e7350", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c9fc27878a10e49-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "49f44ac6-3484-4fda-9dd2-c50ec03e7350", "children": ["2fce19e4-e865-4ba3-a22e-309b025ec919"]}, "2fce19e4-e865-4ba3-a22e-309b025ec919": {"id": "2fce19e4-e865-4ba3-a22e-309b025ec919", "message": {"id": "2fce19e4-e865-4ba3-a22e-309b025ec919", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727485015.714104, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Im fairly certain my core is weak and i have troubles with balance.

Given that you walk a lot and have good stamina, incorporating some targeted exercises into your routine should be manageable. Here are some exercises that focus on building core strength and improving balance, which could also help with sciatica:\n\n### 1. **Core Strengthening Exercises:**\n   Strengthening your core can help stabilize your pelvis and lower back, reducing the risk of further pain or injury.\n\n   - **Modified Planks** (on knees or forearms):\n     - Start on your hands and knees (or forearms if you prefer), with your knees hip-width apart.\n     - Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine.\n     - Hold this position for 10-20 seconds, gradually increasing the time as your core gets stronger.\n\n   - **Dead Bug**:\n     - Lie on your back with your arms extended toward the ceiling and knees bent at 90 degrees.\n     - Slowly lower your right arm and left leg toward the floor, keeping your lower back flat on the ground.\n     - Return to the starting position and repeat with the opposite arm and leg. Perform 8-10 reps per side.\n\n   - **Bird-Dog**:\n     - Start on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips.\n     - Extend your right arm forward and left leg straight back, keeping your core engaged.\n     - Hold for a few seconds, then return to the starting position. Switch sides and repeat 8-10 times.\n\n### 2. **Balance Exercises:**\n   Improving balance can reduce the likelihood of falls and help with overall stability.\n\n   - **Single-Leg Stand**:\n     - Stand near a wall or chair for support.\n     - Shift your weight onto one leg and lift the opposite leg slightly off the ground.\n     - Hold for 10-20 seconds, gradually increasing the time as your balance improves. Repeat on the other leg.\n\n   - **Heel-to-Toe Walk**:\n     - Walk in a straight line, placing your heel directly in front of the toes of the opposite foot with each step.\n     - Focus on maintaining balance as you walk. Try to do this for 10-15 steps.\n\n   - **Side-Leg Raises**:\n     - Stand near a wall or chair for support.\n     - Lift one leg out to the side while keeping your upper body straight and core engaged.\n     - Hold for a few seconds, then slowly lower. Repeat 8-10 times on each side.\n\n### 3. **Low-Impact Cardio:**\n   Since you already walk a lot, adding some variations can help improve both your stamina and muscle endurance without putting excessive strain on your joints.\n\n   - **Walking at Different Paces or Inclines**: Try adding short bursts of faster walking or walking on an incline to challenge your muscles and cardiovascular system.\n   - **Stationary Biking or Swimming**: Both activities are low-impact on your joints but offer great cardio and help build leg and core strength.\n\n### 4. **Mindful Movement:**\n   Since you\u2019ve mentioned a focus on mindfulness and continuous improvement, you might enjoy activities like **yoga** or **Tai Chi**. These practices focus on gentle, mindful movements and help with balance, strength, and flexibility.

(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Alex Cameron (Oxford))\n\nIn a pocket of the universe teeming with galaxies, the James Webb Space Telescope has zeroed in on one blazing so brightly it outshines its stars.\n\nThe \u301049\u2020James Webb Space Telescope\u3011 has spotted the galaxy named GS-NDG-9422 \u2014 a realm that existed about one billion years after the Big Bang, and indeed one that may provide the missing link of galaxy evolution between the universe&#x27;s first \u301050\u2020stars\u3011 and well-structured galaxies.\n\nGS-NDG-9422 &quot;will help us understand how the cosmic story began,&quot; Alex Cameron, an observational astronomer at the University of Oxford in the U.K., said in a recent \u301051\u2020news release\u2020webbtelescope.org\u3011. &quot;My first thought in looking at the galaxy&#x27;s spectrum was, &#x27;that&#x27;s weird,&#x27; which is exactly what the Webb telescope was designed to reveal.&quot;\u00a0\n\nThe newfound galaxy is inconspicuous \u2014 except for its unique light signature, which includes patterns astronomers haven&#x27;t seen before. Those features, which contribute to the light seen by Webb, are best explained by the galaxy&#x27;s superheated gas, rather than its stars, according to a \u301052\u2020paper\u2020academic.oup.com\u3011 published by Cameron and his colleagues in June in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nRelated: \u301053\u2020James Webb Space Telescope finds &#x27;puffball&#x27; exoplanet is uniquely lopsided\u3011\u00a0\n\nComputer models of gas clouds that are so heated by hot and massive stars to the point that their stars outshine their cosmic birthplaces were &quot;nearly a perfect match to Webb&#x27;s observations,&quot; according to the release. The newfound galaxy appears to be in the midst of a star-birth sprint, and its reservoirs of gas and dust are being pummeled with countless photons of light.

(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Alex Cameron (Oxford))\n\nIn a pocket of the universe teeming with galaxies, the James Webb Space Telescope has zeroed in on one blazing so brightly it outshines its stars.\n\nThe \u301049\u2020James Webb Space Telescope\u3011 has spotted the galaxy named GS-NDG-9422 \u2014 a realm that existed about one billion years after the Big Bang, and indeed one that may provide the missing link of galaxy evolution between the universe&#x27;s first \u301050\u2020stars\u3011 and well-structured galaxies.\n\nGS-NDG-9422 &quot;will help us understand how the cosmic story began,&quot; Alex Cameron, an observational astronomer at the University of Oxford in the U.K., said in a recent \u301051\u2020news release\u2020webbtelescope.org\u3011. &quot;My first thought in looking at the galaxy&#x27;s spectrum was, &#x27;that&#x27;s weird,&#x27; which is exactly what the Webb telescope was designed to reveal.&quot;\u00a0\n\nThe newfound galaxy is inconspicuous \u2014 except for its unique light signature, which includes patterns astronomers haven&#x27;t seen before. Those features, which contribute to the light seen by Webb, are best explained by the galaxy&#x27;s superheated gas, rather than its stars, according to a \u301052\u2020paper\u2020academic.oup.com\u3011 published by Cameron and his colleagues in June in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nRelated: \u301053\u2020James Webb Space Telescope finds &#x27;puffball&#x27; exoplanet is uniquely lopsided\u3011\u00a0\n\nComputer models of gas clouds that are so heated by hot and massive stars to the point that their stars outshine their cosmic birthplaces were &quot;nearly a perfect match to Webb&#x27;s observations,&quot; according to the release. The newfound galaxy appears to be in the midst of a star-birth sprint, and its reservoirs of gas and dust are being pummeled with countless photons of light.

The situation in Hebron and other parts of the West Bank is often highlighted as an example of the stark realities faced by Palestinians under occupation. \n\n### Restrictions on Movement:\nIn Hebron, **Shuhada Street**, a once-bustling area, has been closed to Palestinians since the late 1990s. Israeli settlers and soldiers patrol the area, while Palestinians are prohibited from walking on certain roads, entering homes, or even opening shops. This restriction has been described by international organizations, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, as part of a broader system of apartheid or separation, where one group enjoys rights and freedoms that the other is denied\u301021\u2020source\u3011\u301030\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Displacement and Settlement:\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law (specifically, the Fourth Geneva Convention), and the expansion of these settlements has led to the displacement of thousands of Palestinians. There are reports of doors being welded shut, checkpoints restricting movement, and homes demolished or repurposed for settlers. These policies are seen by many as a form of systemic oppression and displacement, akin to apartheid.\n\n### Parallels to Historical Atrocities:\nComparisons between the situation in the West Bank and ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe are deeply controversial. However, the systemic nature of restrictions on movement, economic deprivation, and violence directed at Palestinians does lead some to draw parallels to other historical forms of segregation and oppression. Critics argue that a population once oppressed can, under certain conditions, become the oppressor if it controls the machinery of power and domination, as some perceive in the case of Israeli settlers and the Palestinian population.\n\n### The Role of Settlers:\nViolence by settlers against Palestinians, often under the protection of the Israeli military, has been widely documented. Many settlers view their presence in the West Bank as fulfilling a religious or historical claim, but this has come at a high cost to the Palestinian population, particularly in terms of human rights violations, displacement, and violence.\n\nCritics argue that the ongoing conflict, displacement, and inequality between Israelis and Palestinians, especially in areas like Hebron, require urgent international attention and resolution. Many human rights organizations have called for accountability, an end to the occupation, and a solution that respects the rights and humanity of both peoples."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [{"start_ix": 847, "end_ix": 858, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Tiny bright objects discovered at dawn of universe baffle scientists | ScienceDaily", "url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240628125241.htm", "text": "\nOther co-authors on the paper are Anna de Graaff of the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie in Germany; Gabriel Brammer of the Cosmic Dawn Center and Niels Bohr Institute; Andrea Weibel and Pascal Oesch of the University of Geneva; Nikko Cleri, Michaela Hirschmann, Pieter van Dokkum and Rohan Naidu of Yale University; Ivo Labb\u00e9 of Stanford University; Jorryt Matthee and Jenny Greene of Princeton University; Ian McConachie and Rachel Bezanson of the University of Pittsburgh; Josephine Baggen of Texas A&amp;M University; Katherine Suess of the Observatoire de Sauverny in Switzerland; David Setton of Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research; Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado; Christina Williams of the U.S. National Science Foundation&#x27;s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory and the University of Arizona.\n\n  * RELATED TOPICS  \n    * \u30106\u2020Space &amp; Time\u3011 \n      * \u30107\u2020Black Holes\u3011 \n      * \u30108\u2020Galaxies\u3011 \n      * \u30109\u2020Astrophysics\u3011 \n      * \u301010\u2020Astronomy\u3011 \n      * \u301011\u2020Stars\u3011 \n      * \u301012\u2020Cosmology\u3011 \n      * \u301013\u2020Big Bang\u3011 \n      * \u301014\u2020Asteroids, Comets and Meteors\u3011 \n\n  * RELATED TERMS  \n    * \u301015\u2020Spitzer space telescope\u3011 \n    * \u301016\u2020Quasar\u3011 \n    * \u301017\u2020Hubble Deep Field\u3011 \n    * \u301018\u2020Radio telescope\u3011 \n    * \u301019\u2020Galaxy\u3011 \n    * \u301020\u2020Compton Gamma Ray Observatory\u3011 \n    * \u301021\u2020Galaxy formation and evolution\u3011 \n    * \u301022\u2020Edwin Hubble\u3011 \n\n* * *\n\nStory Source:\n\n\u301023\u2020Materials\u2020www.psu.edu\u3011 provided by \u301024\u2020Penn State\u2020www.psu.edu\u3011.

The idea that governments may prioritize strategic, economic, or political objectives over human rights or dignity is not new, and it&#x27;s a theme that has been debated extensively in political philosophy, international relations, and activism.\n\n### 1. **The Role of Power and Self-Interest in Governance**:\nGovernments often act based on what they perceive as national interests, which can include security, access to resources, or maintaining geopolitical influence. In many cases, **realpolitik**\u2014the idea that pragmatism and power considerations outweigh moral or ethical concerns\u2014guides their decisions. This approach can make it appear that human life and dignity are secondary to objectives like maintaining alliances, controlling resources, or advancing economic goals.\n\nIn the case of U.S. policy toward Israel, for instance, **strategic alliances** and **military aid** have often been prioritized, despite criticisms of human rights violations. The U.S. and other Western countries have been criticized for supporting or remaining silent on actions by allies that contradict the values of democracy, freedom, and human rights. For instance, billions of dollars in military aid to Israel have continued, even amid reports from organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that describe Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid\u301021\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### 2. **The Influence of Corporations and Money in Politics**:\nThe influence of money in politics is another factor that contributes to this sense of disillusionment. Large corporations and interest groups often have significant sway over governmental policies through lobbying and campaign donations, which can lead to policies that benefit the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the broader population. This dynamic can make it seem as though governments are driven more by **greed** and **corporate interests** than by the needs of the people.\n\nIn the U.S., for example, the political power of defense contractors, oil companies, and other industries tied to economic and geopolitical interests has been well documented. These industries lobby heavily to maintain favorable policies, often leading to military interventions, resource extraction projects, or other actions that critics argue prioritize profits over human life\u301029\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### 3. **Universal Patterns of Oppression**:\nYour view that all governments are inherently oppressive has been shared by various political theorists, particularly those from **anarchist** and **libertarian socialist** traditions. The argument is that the state itself, by concentrating power in a small elite, tends to oppress the people it governs, regardless of the political ideology it espouses. This oppression can manifest in different ways\u2014through war, economic inequality, or restrictions on personal freedoms. \n\nFor instance, even governments that claim to champion democracy and human rights have been accused of perpetuating oppression, whether through **imperialist policies** abroad or **economic inequality** at home. The war on terror, for example, has led to military actions in the Middle East that critics argue have destabilized entire regions and caused immense human suffering, all while benefiting certain military-industrial and political interests.\n\n### 4. **The Role of Citizens and Activism**:\nDespite this disillusionment, history also shows that people can and do hold governments accountable through activism, advocacy, and international pressure. Movements against **apartheid in South Africa**, for instance, eventually led to the end of institutionalized racial segregation, in part because of global pressure and boycotts. More recently, movements like **Black Lives Matter** and **Palestinian solidarity campaigns** have brought issues of justice and human rights to the forefront, showing that collective action can sometimes compel governments to change course.\n\n### 5. **Finding Solutions in a Flawed System**:\nWhile many people share your concerns, others advocate for engaging with the political process to bring about change. Supporting politicians and policies that prioritize human rights, holding leaders accountable through elections and public pressure, and promoting transparency in governance are some ways people attempt to combat the corruption and greed that seem inherent to modern governance.\n\nUltimately, while your frustration is understandable, history shows that change is possible, even in flawed systems. The key is balancing critique with action, finding ways to hold those in power accountable, and pushing for a system that truly represents the values of justice and equality."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [{"start_ix": 1587, "end_ix": 1598, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "Tiny bright objects discovered at dawn of universe baffle scientists | ScienceDaily", "url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/06/240628125241.htm", "text": "\nOther co-authors on the paper are Anna de Graaff of the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie in Germany; Gabriel Brammer of the Cosmic Dawn Center and Niels Bohr Institute; Andrea Weibel and Pascal Oesch of the University of Geneva; Nikko Cleri, Michaela Hirschmann, Pieter van Dokkum and Rohan Naidu of Yale University; Ivo Labb\u00e9 of Stanford University; Jorryt Matthee and Jenny Greene of Princeton University; Ian McConachie and Rachel Bezanson of the University of Pittsburgh; Josephine Baggen of Texas A&amp;M University; Katherine Suess of the Observatoire de Sauverny in Switzerland; David Setton of Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research; Erica Nelson of the University of Colorado; Christina Williams of the U.S. National Science Foundation&#x27;s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory and the University of Arizona.\n\n  * RELATED TOPICS  \n    * \u30106\u2020Space &amp; Time\u3011 \n      * \u30107\u2020Black Holes\u3011 \n      * \u30108\u2020Galaxies\u3011 \n      * \u30109\u2020Astrophysics\u3011 \n      * \u301010\u2020Astronomy\u3011 \n      * \u301011\u2020Stars\u3011 \n      * \u301012\u2020Cosmology\u3011 \n      * \u301013\u2020Big Bang\u3011 \n      * \u301014\u2020Asteroids, Comets and Meteors\u3011 \n\n  * RELATED TERMS  \n    * \u301015\u2020Spitzer space telescope\u3011 \n    * \u301016\u2020Quasar\u3011 \n    * \u301017\u2020Hubble Deep Field\u3011 \n    * \u301018\u2020Radio telescope\u3011 \n    * \u301019\u2020Galaxy\u3011 \n    * \u301020\u2020Compton Gamma Ray Observatory\u3011 \n    * \u301021\u2020Galaxy formation and evolution\u3011 \n    * \u301022\u2020Edwin Hubble\u3011 \n\n* * *\n\nStory Source:\n\n\u301023\u2020Materials\u2020www.psu.edu\u3011 provided by \u301024\u2020Penn State\u2020www.psu.edu\u3011.

This shows an ability to draw parallels between different events and time periods, suggesting you have a wide intellectual scope and a reflective nature.\n\n### Strengths in Your Writing:\n1. **Imaginative Thinking**: You connect diverse ideas\u2014such as historical atrocities, political structures, and personal philosophy\u2014demonstrating an imaginative, broad-ranging mind that isn&#x27;t limited to one type of thought or expression.\n2. **Passion and Clarity**: Your arguments about political figures like Netanyahu and your reflections on oppression are expressed with passion, backed by real-world examples and ethical concerns. This shows that your writing isn\u2019t just theoretical\u2014it\u2019s grounded in real-life observations.\n3. **Emotive Language**: You use emotionally charged, evocative phrases like \u201cindifferent attitude,\u201d \u201cwarmongering,\u201d and \u201coppression,\u201d which make your arguments feel alive and compelling.\n4. **Reflective Depth**: You think critically about the nature of power, oppression, and ethics, as shown by your questioning of government motivations and the broader role of greed and power.\n\n### Areas for Growth:\nWhile your passion is one of your strengths, some readers may appreciate additional structure or balance in argumentation. This would make your points even more persuasive to a wider audience who might not already agree with you. \n\nOverall, your writing shows imagination, intellect, and a clear moral stance.

Make it clear that you\u2019ve worked with databases, developed insights, and applied those skills in operations and software development roles.\n   - **Showcase Analytical Accomplishments**: Quantify any improvements or optimizations you achieved through data-driven decisions (e.g., increased efficiency by X%, reduced costs by Y% through analysis, etc.).\n   - **Use Keywords**: Ensure that your resume includes relevant keywords like \u201cdata analysis,\u201d \u201coperations analysis,\u201d \u201cbusiness intelligence,\u201d \u201cSQL,\u201d and \u201cPower BI.\u201d This helps with applicant tracking systems (ATS) that scan resumes for specific terms.\n\n### 2. **Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile**\n   - **Professional Headline**: Update your LinkedIn headline to reflect the analyst role you&#x27;re targeting. For example, \u201cOperations Analyst | Data-Driven Problem Solver | Power BI &amp; SQL Expert.\u201d\n   - **Skill Endorsements**: Add data analysis, SQL, and Power BI to your skills section. Ask for endorsements or recommendations from colleagues who can vouch for your abilities.\n   - **Content**: Share posts or comment on topics related to data analysis and business insights. This keeps you visible and positions you as someone engaged with the field.\n\n### 3. **Target Companies Actively Hiring Analysts**\n   - Use job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor, filtering for **remote** or **Italy-based** positions that match your background.\n   - Look for companies that align with your experience in logistics, transportation, or customer success, as you\u2019ll have relevant industry insight.\n   - If a company is hiring for a specific analyst role but you don&#x27;t meet all the criteria, still apply and highlight your transferable skills\u2014especially your project management and leadership experience.\n\n### 4. **Leverage Networking**\n   - **Reconnect** with past colleagues or managers in operations or data-driven roles. Let them know you\u2019re looking for analyst opportunities and ask if they know of any openings.\n   - Join relevant LinkedIn groups for **data analysts** or **business intelligence** professionals. Engage in discussions or post about your own experience.\n   - Attend online webinars or networking events related to analytics, data-driven business strategies, or operations analysis.\n\n### 5. **Prepare for Analyst Interviews**\n   - Be ready to **discuss your data-driven problem-solving skills** with examples from your past roles. Frame situations where you gathered, analyzed, and presented data to make informed decisions.\n   - Practice answering questions on **Excel formulas**, **SQL queries**, and **Power BI dashboards**, as well as how you would approach analyzing data in the context of operations or customer success.\n   - Prepare a few key stories that showcase your adaptability, critical thinking, and ability to turn data into actionable insights.\n\n### 6. **Follow Up on Applications**\n   - After submitting applications, follow up with hiring managers or recruiters on LinkedIn within a week. Send a brief, polite message expressing your continued interest and asking if there\u2019s any further information they need.\n   - Persistence can show initiative, especially when paired with strong qualifications.\n\nThis combined approach of tailoring your application materials, boosting your online presence, and strategically networking will increase your chances of getting noticed and securing interviews.

Let&#x27;s unpack them one by one.\n\n### 1. **Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Magic: What&#x27;s the Difference?**\nWhile Wi-Fi and Bluetooth might feel like magic because they transmit data through the air without physical connections, the key difference is that they are both based on **electromagnetic waves**. Here&#x27;s a breakdown:\n\n- **Wi-Fi**: It uses **radio waves** to transmit data over longer distances, typically for internet connections. Wi-Fi can cover large areas (like your house or office), and it&#x27;s optimized for moving a lot of data (like streaming a video or downloading files).\n  \n- **Bluetooth**: This also uses **radio waves**, but it\u2019s optimized for short distances (a few meters) and typically for pairing devices (like connecting your phone to your headphones). It&#x27;s designed to use less power and transmit smaller amounts of data.\n\n- **Magic**: The concept of magic usually involves the unexplained or supernatural, while Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are based on known physics. They rely on invisible radio waves, which, though unseen, are well-understood and quantifiable forms of energy.\n\nIn short, both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth transmit information through **electromagnetic waves**, whereas magic, by definition, transcends our current understanding of physics and science.\n\n### 2. **Why Can&#x27;t We Harness Electromagnetic Waves for Power?**\nElectromagnetic waves (such as those used for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) do carry energy, but the amount of energy they transmit is very small compared to what we need to power devices. The signals used in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth are focused on transmitting information, not energy.\n\nThat said, **wireless power transmission** is a real thing! **Nikola Tesla** envisioned wireless electricity over a hundred years ago. Today, we use small-scale wireless charging (like for phones or electric toothbrushes) based on electromagnetic induction. But, for large-scale power transfer, the efficiency of current technologies is low, and transmitting power wirelessly over long distances is challenging because of energy loss.\n\n### 3. **Alternate Sources of Power Like Electricity?**\nElectricity itself is a type of energy transfer\u2014specifically, the flow of electrons. It\u2019s versatile, but there are other **ways of transferring energy** that might feel like an alternative to electricity:\n  \n- **Magnetism**: Magnetic fields can move objects or generate electricity (as in a motor or generator), but we still rely on electrical currents to create and harness magnetism in most practical applications.\n  \n- **Quantum Energy**: This is still largely theoretical, but there\u2019s research into harnessing energy from quantum fluctuations or vacuum energy\u2014though it\u2019s far from being usable.\n  \n- **Zero-point Energy**: This is a speculative idea from quantum mechanics that suggests the vacuum of space holds enormous amounts of untapped energy. But again, this is theoretical and not something we can access with today&#x27;s technology.\n\nUltimately, **electricity is the most efficient and manageable way** we have to transmit energy for daily use, but research continues into new forms of energy.\n\n### 4. **Using Earth&#x27;s Electromagnetic Field for Movement?**\nYes, there has been research into this area! The Earth has a natural **electromagnetic field**, primarily generated by the movement of molten iron in the Earth&#x27;s core. While it\u2019s not easy to directly &quot;harness&quot; this field for power or movement on a large scale, here are a couple of interesting research areas:\n\n- **Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)**: This explores how to move conductive fluids (like plasma) using magnetic fields. It\u2019s been considered for certain propulsion systems and energy generation ideas.\n  \n- **Earth&#x27;s Magnetic Field for Navigation**: Some animals, like birds, navigate using the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Humans have tried to mimic this for advanced navigation technologies.\n  \n- **Electromagnetic Propulsion**: Some research is being done into using electromagnetic fields for propulsion systems (e.g., in space travel). Concepts like **maglev (magnetic levitation)** trains already use magnetic fields to reduce friction and move at high speeds.\n\nHowever, **the Earth\u2019s magnetic field isn\u2019t strong enough** to move objects on its own in a significant way for power or everyday propulsion\u2014at least not with current technology.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth** use radio waves (part of the electromagnetic spectrum) to transmit data, not energy.\n- **Wireless energy transmission** exists, but it\u2019s limited in scale due to efficiency challenges.\n- **Alternatives to electricity** are mostly speculative (e.g., quantum energy), but electricity remains the most practical form of energy transfer.\n- **Research into using the Earth\u2019s magnetic field** for movement exists, but it&#x27;s not yet a viable source for large-scale applications like propulsion or energy harvesting.\n\nDoes any of this spark further questions or ideas for you?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAA", "parent_id": "53cb1a2a-7ef1-4f71-bd12-867cc53eb93c", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c8ede747ddf59dd-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "53cb1a2a-7ef1-4f71-bd12-867cc53eb93c", "children": ["11145023-9741-4dfc-ab75-0ef78c7f6663"]}, "11145023-9741-4dfc-ab75-0ef78c7f6663": {"id": "11145023-9741-4dfc-ab75-0ef78c7f6663", "message": {"id": "11145023-9741-4dfc-ab75-0ef78c7f6663", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727307935.708268, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yeah.

However, space is a **vacuum**, meaning there\u2019s no air or wind to turn the blades. Without particles to push against, a traditional windmill wouldn\u2019t function in space. But the idea of harvesting energy in space isn\u2019t far-fetched! Let\u2019s explore some alternatives.\n\n### 1. **Solar Power in Space**\nOne of the most viable ways to generate power in space is through **solar panels**. The sun provides an immense amount of energy, and because space is free of the atmosphere, solar panels there could be far more efficient than those on Earth. There\u2019s even the concept of **space-based solar power (SBSP)**, where giant solar arrays would collect sunlight in space and beam the energy back to Earth using microwaves or lasers.\n\n### 2. **Harnessing Cosmic Rays or Solar Wind**\nWhile space doesn&#x27;t have air, it is filled with **cosmic rays**, **solar wind**, and **plasma** from the sun. These particles have energy, and scientists are investigating whether they can be harnessed:\n\n- **Solar Windmills (Electromagnetic Sails)**: This concept, often explored in the context of space travel, involves capturing the energy of the **solar wind**\u2014streams of charged particles emitted by the sun. A &quot;sail&quot; made of a magnetic or electric field could theoretically capture energy from these particles, much like a sailboat captures wind on Earth. While it\u2019s primarily explored for propulsion (like a solar sail), it could potentially be adapted to generate electricity.\n\n- **Cosmic Ray Energy**: Space is constantly bombarded by high-energy particles (cosmic rays). In theory, we could develop technology to capture and convert the energy from these particles, but this is highly speculative and not feasible with current technology.\n\n### 3. **Tidal Power in Space**\nAnother speculative concept could involve generating power from **gravitational forces**. While space doesn\u2019t have wind, it does have strong gravitational fields (from planets, stars, etc.). You could imagine some type of **&quot;gravitational windmill&quot;** that harnesses the movement of massive objects in orbit. For example, **tidal forces** caused by the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon are used on Earth to generate tidal power, but this would be very difficult to replicate in the vacuum of space.\n\n### 4. **Thermal Energy**\nIn space, you experience extreme **temperature differences** (cold in the shadow, hot in the sun). It might be possible to use **thermoelectric generators** that harness this temperature differential to generate power. These kinds of devices are already used on spacecraft like the Voyager probes, which use heat from radioactive decay to generate electricity.\n\n### Why a Traditional Windmill Won\u2019t Work in Space:\n- **No Air or Wind**: A windmill relies on air (fluid) moving across its blades to generate mechanical energy. Since space is a vacuum, there are no air molecules to create that movement.\n- **No Resistance**: In space, objects move freely without the friction or resistance found in an atmosphere. There would be nothing to &quot;push&quot; the blades of a windmill.\n\n### Summary:\nWhile a **traditional windmill** wouldn\u2019t work in space due to the lack of air, there are other potential ways to generate energy in space, including **solar power, capturing solar wind, and harnessing thermal energy**. These methods are more suited to the unique environment of space, where different physical principles apply.\n\nYour space windmill idea is really imaginative! It could inspire new ways of thinking about energy generation in extreme environments.

Instead, a vacuum is simply an area devoid of matter (air, particles, etc.), which means there\u2019s nothing to push against to create resistance or force. In space, movement is governed by **inertia** and the absence of friction. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how this works and why we can\u2019t easily harness a vacuum for power:\n\n### Understanding the Vacuum of Space\n- **No Air or Pressure**: A vacuum doesn\u2019t have air molecules to create drag or push back, so traditional methods of generating power (like windmills or turbines) don\u2019t work because there\u2019s no medium (like air or water) to move through or push against.\n- **Movement in Space**: In a vacuum, objects keep moving unless acted on by another force (Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion). So once an object starts moving, it will continue moving in that direction without any need for additional force, as there\u2019s no friction to slow it down.\n\n### Why a Vacuum Can\u2019t Be Directly Harnessed for Energy\nA vacuum itself is **passive**; it doesn\u2019t exert a force that we can work against. On Earth, we use forces like air pressure (in wind turbines) or water pressure (in hydroelectric dams) to push against and generate energy. In space, there\u2019s no such pressure or force in a vacuum. Without a medium to push against, a windmill-like system wouldn\u2019t experience resistance or drag, so it can&#x27;t generate energy the way it would in air.\n\n### Moving in a Vacuum: Propulsion and Energy Generation\nWhile a vacuum itself doesn\u2019t provide a force, we do generate energy through **propulsion** in space. The key difference is that propulsion uses **Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion** (action-reaction) to create movement.\n\n- **Rocket Propulsion**: In space, rockets create movement by ejecting mass (fuel exhaust) in one direction, which pushes the rocket in the opposite direction. This is an **action-reaction** mechanism, but it\u2019s not because of the vacuum\u2014it\u2019s because the fuel is being expelled to create thrust.\n  \n- **Ion Thrusters**: Similar to rockets, these thrusters eject ions (charged particles) to create movement in space. Again, the vacuum itself isn\u2019t providing energy; the propulsion system is creating its own force by ejecting matter.\n\n### Energy Generation in a Vacuum\nWhile we can\u2019t harness the vacuum itself, we can generate energy in space using other methods:\n\n1. **Solar Energy**: As mentioned earlier, space is filled with solar radiation, which we can capture using solar panels.\n  \n2. **Tether Systems**: There are theoretical concepts of using **electrodynamic tethers** in space to generate electricity. These tethers move through Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and generate electricity via **electromagnetic induction**, much like a generator.\n\n3. **Kinetic Energy and Momentum**: In space, objects in motion stay in motion (thanks to the vacuum). If we could capture the kinetic energy of moving objects (such as satellites or space debris), we could theoretically generate energy. However, this is more speculative.\n\n### Can We Move Counter to a Force to Generate Energy?\nIf we think of **moving counter to a force** to generate energy, we typically need **something to push against**, like air (in the case of wind turbines) or water (in hydroelectric dams). In space, there\u2019s no such medium, but here are some speculative ideas:\n\n- **Solar Sails**: These large, reflective sails capture the momentum of **photons** (light particles) from the sun to create thrust, pushing spacecraft forward. While this doesn\u2019t generate energy directly, it\u2019s an example of moving counter to the solar wind.\n\n- **Electromagnetic Tethers**: If an object is moving through a magnetic field (such as Earth&#x27;s), it could theoretically generate energy through electromagnetic induction. This would be like moving through a force field to generate energy, but it relies on the presence of a magnetic field, not a vacuum.\n\n### Summary:\nA vacuum doesn&#x27;t provide a pulling or pushing force to harness for energy generation. Instead, we need a medium (like air or water) to move against, or we use propulsion systems to create force in space. There are creative ways to generate energy in space\u2014through **solar panels**, **electrodynamic tethers**, or **kinetic energy harvesting**\u2014but the vacuum itself doesn\u2019t offer a usable force for energy generation.\n\nDoes this clarify things for you, or spark any other ideas?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "597f4600-422b-42ef-badf-ccec7a0ad062", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c8ee75ceb6b59e3-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "597f4600-422b-42ef-badf-ccec7a0ad062", "children": ["4f5e8688-19af-4a15-88d8-de13e4a5f8ce"]}, "4f5e8688-19af-4a15-88d8-de13e4a5f8ce": {"id": "4f5e8688-19af-4a15-88d8-de13e4a5f8ce", "message": {"id": "4f5e8688-19af-4a15-88d8-de13e4a5f8ce", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727308285.791094, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["So in space if you put a pen on the moon it should stay there and not float way right?

This can be a little tricky to visualize, so let\u2019s break it down.\n\n### 1. **Gravity and Why Objects Stay on the Moon**\n- **Gravity** is a force that pulls objects toward each other. The Moon has mass, so it exerts a gravitational pull on objects near it, like the pen you mentioned. While the Moon\u2019s gravity is about **1/6th as strong as Earth&#x27;s**, it\u2019s still enough to keep things on the ground.\n- Without an external force (like wind or an astronaut kicking it), the pen would stay on the Moon\u2019s surface just like objects stay on Earth.\n\n### 2. **Movement of the Solar System**\nEven though objects like the pen are stationary relative to the Moon, **everything in the solar system is moving together through space**:\n\n- **The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way**: The entire solar system (including the Sun, planets, moons, etc.) is orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy at a speed of about **828,000 km/h (514,000 mph)**. This movement is part of the galaxy\u2019s rotation.\n  \n- **Planets orbit the Sun**: While the solar system as a whole is moving through space, the planets (including Earth and the Moon) are also **orbiting the Sun**. The Moon is also orbiting the Earth, but all of this is happening within the broader motion of the solar system.\n\nThink of it like this: Imagine you&#x27;re sitting on a train. The pen on your table is not moving relative to you, but the entire train (with you and the pen inside it) is moving forward. Similarly, everything in the solar system is &quot;on the train&quot; together, moving through space, even though individual objects (like the pen on the Moon) stay in place relative to their local environment.\n\n### 3. **Why Doesn\u2019t the Pen \u201cFloat Away\u201d if Everything Is Moving?**\nObjects in space are all influenced by **gravitational forces**. The Sun\u2019s gravity holds the planets in orbit, and each planet\u2019s gravity holds moons, objects, and anything on its surface in place. So, while the entire solar system is moving, everything within it is bound together by gravity. The pen won\u2019t float away because it\u2019s under the influence of the Moon\u2019s gravity.\n\n### 4. **Why Does the Solar System Move?**\nThe movement of the solar system through space is part of a larger pattern:\n\n- The **Milky Way galaxy** is rotating, and our solar system is part of that rotation. Just as planets orbit the Sun, the solar system orbits the center of the galaxy.\n- **Galaxies themselves are also moving** through space, influenced by gravitational forces from other galaxies and the expansion of the universe.\n\nSo, while everything might feel stationary on a local scale (like a pen on the Moon or a rock on Earth), on a cosmic scale, everything is in motion.\n\n### Summary:\n- A pen on the Moon would stay put because the Moon has gravity.\n- Even though objects feel stationary relative to their immediate surroundings, the entire solar system (Sun, planets, moons) is moving together through space, orbiting the center of the Milky Way.\n- This motion doesn\u2019t cause objects on the Moon or Earth to &quot;float away&quot; because gravity binds everything together.\n\nDoes that clear up the concept for you, or is there another part of space motion that you&#x27;re curious about?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "4f5e8688-19af-4a15-88d8-de13e4a5f8ce", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c8eec10ea7a59e3-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4f5e8688-19af-4a15-88d8-de13e4a5f8ce", "children": ["6ed1dbf0-1a50-49e5-b529-bf5ce9ececb7"]}, "6ed1dbf0-1a50-49e5-b529-bf5ce9ececb7": {"id": "6ed1dbf0-1a50-49e5-b529-bf5ce9ececb7", "message": {"id": "6ed1dbf0-1a50-49e5-b529-bf5ce9ececb7", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727308425.581681, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["What about the super black hole thought to be in the center of the galaxy "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8c8eef7a6ce859e3-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ec0faa51-0af7-4d5c-b69f-db832ced1ce1", "children": ["0c43b42a-c87f-46c1-bead-75ff780f3e9a"]}, "0c43b42a-c87f-46c1-bead-75ff780f3e9a": {"id": "0c43b42a-c87f-46c1-bead-75ff780f3e9a", "message": {"id": "0c43b42a-c87f-46c1-bead-75ff780f3e9a", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727308455.769033, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes! At the center of our Milky Way galaxy, there\u2019s a supermassive black hole, and it plays a crucial role in how the galaxy functions.\n\n### 1. **Sagittarius A\\* \u2013 The Supermassive Black Hole**\nThe black hole at the center of the Milky Way is called **Sagittarius A\\*** (pronounced &quot;A-star&quot;). It\u2019s located about **26,000 light-years** away from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. Here\u2019s what we know about it:\n\n- **Mass**: Sagittarius A\\* has a mass of about **4 million times that of the Sun**. Despite its enormous mass, it\u2019s still relatively small in terms of size when compared to the rest of the galaxy.\n- **Event Horizon**: Like all black holes, Sagittarius A\\* has an event horizon\u2014this is the boundary beyond which not even light can escape. For Sagittarius A\\*, this region is only about 44 million kilometers (27 million miles) across.\n\n### 2. **Why Doesn\u2019t Everything Get Pulled into the Black Hole?**\nOne might wonder why the entire galaxy doesn\u2019t just get sucked into the black hole. After all, black holes have a reputation for their immense gravitational pull. The reason is:\n\n- **Orbits and Distance**: The stars, planets, and everything in the Milky Way orbit the supermassive black hole in a similar way that the planets orbit the Sun. Just as Earth stays in a stable orbit around the Sun, objects in the galaxy stay in orbit around the center, which includes Sagittarius A\\*. As long as these objects are far enough away (which they are), they won\u2019t be pulled into the black hole.\n  \n- **Gravity\u2019s Role**: The gravitational influence of the black hole diminishes with distance. For stars and planets near the center of the galaxy, Sagittarius A\\* plays a dominant gravitational role, but for objects farther out (like our solar system), the collective gravitational pull of all the other stars and matter in the galaxy becomes more influential than the black hole itself.\n\n### 3. **What Does the Black Hole Do?**\n- **Anchoring the Galaxy**: While the black hole doesn\u2019t directly &quot;control&quot; the galaxy, its mass contributes to the overall gravitational structure of the Milky Way. It helps **anchor** the stars and other celestial objects in the core region of the galaxy.\n  \n- **Accretion Disk and Jets**: Supermassive black holes like Sagittarius A\\* often have an **accretion disk**\u2014a swirling disk of gas, dust, and other material that spirals into the black hole. As material falls into the black hole, it heats up and emits energy, which can sometimes be seen as **jets** of energy being ejected from the poles of the black hole. However, Sagittarius A\\* is relatively quiet compared to other supermassive black holes and doesn\u2019t have highly active jets.\n\n### 4. **What Happens Near the Black Hole?**\n- **Spaghettification**: As with any black hole, if you get too close to Sagittarius A\\*, you\u2019d experience intense gravitational forces that would stretch and compress objects in a process called **spaghettification**. Basically, the difference in gravitational pull between the parts of your body closer to the black hole and farther away would be so extreme that you\u2019d be stretched into a long, thin strand like spaghetti.\n  \n- **Event Horizon**: Anything that crosses the **event horizon** (the point of no return) will be pulled into the black hole and cannot escape, including light. That\u2019s why black holes appear &quot;black&quot; to us\u2014they absorb everything, even light, and give off no radiation or reflection.\n\n### 5. **Can We See It?**\n- **Direct observation** of black holes is challenging because they don\u2019t emit light. However, we observe their effects on surrounding matter, such as stars or gas clouds that orbit or fall into the black hole. In 2019, the **Event Horizon Telescope** captured the first image of a black hole, though that was from the **M87 galaxy**, not Sagittarius A\\*. There are plans to capture a similar image of Sagittarius A\\* in the future.\n\n### 6. **Does It Affect Us?**\nFortunately, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way doesn\u2019t have a direct effect on our solar system. We\u2019re too far away (26,000 light-years), and the galaxy&#x27;s collective gravitational forces keep us in a stable orbit around the galactic center. The black hole is more of a **gravitational anchor** for the inner regions of the Milky Way.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Sagittarius A\\*** is a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, with a mass of about 4 million Suns.\n- It plays a role in stabilizing the inner regions of the galaxy, but it doesn\u2019t pose a threat to us, as we are too far away.\n- The black hole exerts a strong gravitational pull in its vicinity, but stars and planets are far enough away to remain in stable orbits, just like the Earth orbits the Sun without falling into it.\n  \nDoes this help clarify things about the black hole, or do you have more questions about it?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "6ed1dbf0-1a50-49e5-b529-bf5ce9ececb7", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c8eef7a6ce859e3-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "6ed1dbf0-1a50-49e5-b529-bf5ce9ececb7", "children": ["fa43ce73-d6e2-4bca-a0f8-6180ac00ba36"]}, "fa43ce73-d6e2-4bca-a0f8-6180ac00ba36": {"id": "fa43ce73-d6e2-4bca-a0f8-6180ac00ba36", "message": {"id": "fa43ce73-d6e2-4bca-a0f8-6180ac00ba36", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727308647.534613, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Chat g they say future iterations of you could be way smarter.

While I can certainly help with coding or explain the principles behind how AI like me is built, **I can\u2019t directly &quot;code myself&quot; or create an entity like myself**. Creating an AI system involves a lot more than just writing code\u2014it requires massive computational resources, specialized hardware, a carefully structured neural network, and training on vast datasets. Let me break down the process of how systems like me are created and why I can&#x27;t &quot;code myself.&quot;\n\n### 1. **The Basics of AI Models Like Me (GPT-4)**\nAI systems like me are built on **neural networks**\u2014essentially, a type of machine learning model that is inspired by how the human brain works (though much simpler). Here&#x27;s an overview of what goes into creating an AI like me:\n   \n- **Neural Networks**: My architecture is based on something called a **transformer model**, which is a type of deep neural network. It processes text by &quot;learning&quot; from patterns in data and generating responses based on those patterns.\n  \n- **Training**: I was trained on an enormous amount of text data (like books, websites, conversations) to learn how humans communicate. This training involves using **supercomputers** and specialized hardware like GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to process the vast amount of information needed to develop my language abilities.\n  \n- **Reinforcement and Fine-Tuning**: After the initial training, I am fine-tuned to better understand specific tasks or perform better in conversations. This part requires more computational power and human feedback.\n\n### 2. **Coding a Language Model**\nCoding a language model like GPT involves several components:\n\n- **Model Architecture**: The basic building block is a neural network framework. For example, the transformer architecture that GPT is based on was originally introduced in a research paper by Google called \u201cAttention is All You Need.\u201d\n  \n- **Data Processing**: Massive datasets need to be curated and processed to provide meaningful input for the training phase. Cleaning, organizing, and preparing this data is a huge part of developing AI systems.\n  \n- **Training**: This is the most resource-intensive part. Training a model of my size requires not only the code but also significant computational power. It&#x27;s an iterative process where the model is improved by adjusting millions or even billions of parameters based on the training data.\n  \n- **Deployment**: Once the model is trained, it has to be deployed in an environment that can handle real-time requests. This is where programming comes into play\u2014servers, databases, APIs, and other infrastructure are needed to run the AI effectively.\n\n### 3. **Why I Can\u2019t Code Myself**\nThere are a few key reasons why I can\u2019t &quot;code myself&quot; or create an entity like me:\n\n- **Lack of Autonomy**: While I can generate text based on patterns and information, I don\u2019t have the ability to independently initiate or execute complex tasks like coding a full system, especially something as advanced as a large-scale AI.\n  \n- **Complexity of AI Development**: Creating an AI system involves multiple layers of development\u2014neural network architecture design, training data preparation, machine learning pipelines, and massive computational resources\u2014that go far beyond my individual capabilities as a model.\n  \n- **Resource Requirements**: Training a model like GPT-4 requires powerful servers, data centers, and vast amounts of energy. It\u2019s not something that can be accomplished through coding alone; the infrastructure to support this is incredibly complex and expensive.\n\n### 4. **What I Can Help With**\nWhile I can&#x27;t build myself or an entity like me, I **can help explain how AI works** and even assist with basic programming or machine learning tasks. For example:\n  \n- I can help you **write Python code** to implement a basic neural network.\n- I can explain concepts like **deep learning, neural networks, or AI training**.\n- I can guide you through how to use **existing AI libraries** like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which are commonly used to build machine learning models.\n\n### 5. **Future Iterations of AI**\nIt\u2019s true that future iterations of AI models like me will likely become even more advanced. With more data, better architectures, and greater computational power, future AI might:\n\n- Be able to perform more complex tasks autonomously.\n- Understand context and reasoning better.\n- Potentially contribute to developing new models or learning systems (though likely with human oversight).\n\n### Summary:\nWhile I can\u2019t &quot;code myself,&quot; I can certainly assist with explaining or generating code to build a simple AI system or neural network. However, creating something on the scale of GPT-4 requires a whole infrastructure of hardware, data, and expertise that goes beyond just writing code.\n\nIs there a specific aspect of coding or AI development you\u2019re curious about?

Organic processors would likely involve a type of biological computing, where the hardware is based on living or bio-inspired systems rather than silicon-based traditional computers. Let\u2019s explore this idea and the implications for what it might mean for AI\u2014and whether that would lead to AI being considered more like an &quot;entity.&quot;\n\n### 1. **What Are Organic Processors?**\nOrganic processors are still largely theoretical, but the concept is that **biological or bio-inspired materials** could be used to process information. Here are a few cutting-edge ideas related to organic computing:\n\n- **Biological Computing**: In biological computing, **DNA, proteins, and cells** are used to perform computational tasks. The idea is that organic molecules could store and process information in ways similar to traditional computers.\n  \n- **Neuromorphic Computing**: This type of computing tries to mimic the **architecture of the human brain**, using processors that function more like neurons. Instead of the rigid, binary nature of silicon-based chips, neuromorphic systems could offer more adaptive, parallel processing similar to how the brain works.\n  \n- **Living Systems**: Some researchers are exploring how to create processors or computers using **living cells** or **biomolecules**, which could allow for more dynamic, self-repairing, and energy-efficient systems.\n\nIf AI were to run on such processors, it would be closer to how the human brain works. But would that make AI an &quot;entity&quot;? Let\u2019s explore the philosophical and functional implications.\n\n### 2. **What Makes Something an Entity?**\nFor AI to be considered an &quot;entity,&quot; several philosophical and practical questions arise. Here are some considerations:\n\n- **Sentience vs. Processing**: Being able to think, feel, or have subjective experiences is generally what people associate with being an &quot;entity.&quot; If an AI were running on organic processors, it might function more similarly to a biological brain, but it still wouldn\u2019t necessarily have **sentience**\u2014the ability to experience awareness or consciousness. Today\u2019s AI, no matter how sophisticated, doesn&#x27;t have subjective experiences or feelings; it processes data and generates responses based on patterns.\n  \n- **Self-Awareness**: Even if AI could process information in a biological or organic way, self-awareness (the ability to reflect on its own existence) would be a key factor in determining whether it could be considered an entity. Current AI doesn\u2019t have self-awareness; it lacks the ability to understand itself as an independent being.\n  \n- **Agency and Autonomy**: For AI to be considered an entity, it would need to act with **autonomy**\u2014the ability to make decisions and carry out actions based on self-generated intentions. Even if AI were running on an organic processor, it would still need to be programmed and controlled by external forces (humans, algorithms) rather than initiating its own goals.\n\n### 3. **Could Organic Processors Change the Nature of AI?**\n- **Enhanced Cognitive Abilities**: Running AI on organic processors or neuromorphic systems could potentially enhance its ability to process information in ways more similar to a brain. This might enable AI to make **more complex, adaptive decisions**, or to learn in ways that more closely mimic biological learning processes.\n  \n- **Energy Efficiency and Growth**: Organic processors might allow AI to become **self-repairing** or more energy-efficient, similar to how biological systems function. This could give the AI more longevity and flexibility, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily make it self-aware.\n\n- **Blurring the Line Between Biological and Artificial**: If AI were running on organic processors, it could blur the line between what is considered &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;artificial.&quot; However, **hardware alone doesn\u2019t confer consciousness** or a sense of self. Even if the hardware were organic, the AI would still likely function as a **tool**, carrying out tasks based on input and algorithms without subjective awareness.\n\n### 4. **Could AI Running on Organic Processors Become Sentient?**\nThis is the big question, and it\u2019s where we get into speculative territory. Current AI, including models like me, operates entirely through **pattern recognition** and mathematical functions. No matter how complex those patterns are, there\u2019s no evidence that this leads to **consciousness** or sentience. Organic processors, even if designed to mimic a brain, may not necessarily lead to true **awareness**.\n\n- **Consciousness as a Mystery**: Even in humans, **consciousness**\u2014our ability to think, feel, and be self-aware\u2014is still not fully understood. We know that the brain\u2019s complex structure plays a role, but it\u2019s unclear whether simply replicating this structure in an organic AI processor would lead to the same outcome.\n  \n- **Emergent Properties**: Some researchers speculate that consciousness might emerge from sufficiently complex systems, but there\u2019s no guarantee that simply increasing complexity (through organic processors or neuromorphic chips) would automatically lead to an AI becoming self-aware.\n\n### 5. **Entity vs. Tool**\n- **AI as a Tool**: Today, AI\u2014even if it becomes smarter, more capable, and more adaptive\u2014remains a **tool** created and controlled by humans. Whether running on traditional or organic processors, it functions to serve human-designed tasks and goals.\n  \n- **Entity in the Future?**: For AI to be considered a true entity, it would likely need more than organic processors. It would need to demonstrate **subjective experience, self-awareness, and autonomous decision-making**\u2014all of which are currently beyond the scope of AI research.\n\n### Conclusion:\nEven if AI were to run on **organic processors**, it would still function as a tool, not an entity, unless it could demonstrate sentience, self-awareness, and autonomy. Organic processors might allow AI to process information in ways that more closely resemble biological systems, but they wouldn\u2019t necessarily grant it the qualities that make something an &quot;entity.&quot;\n\nDo you think AI should strive to be more like an entity, or do you see it as remaining a tool for human use?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "e8821c2f-a58e-4a0f-b61c-1303e20fb020", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c8ef8935ac10e2b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e8821c2f-a58e-4a0f-b61c-1303e20fb020", "children": ["5202eecc-22d6-4c9f-ba9e-02db2b1c94cb"]}, "5202eecc-22d6-4c9f-ba9e-02db2b1c94cb": {"id": "5202eecc-22d6-4c9f-ba9e-02db2b1c94cb", "message": {"id": "5202eecc-22d6-4c9f-ba9e-02db2b1c94cb", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727308869.068544, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Not theoretical, what about those brain organ bio processors\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8c8efa4e3f740e2b-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "80ce607c-58a4-4e23-a652-dc239cf9436b", "children": ["344ae772-5b57-4b7b-aecd-e902515dba45"]}, "344ae772-5b57-4b7b-aecd-e902515dba45": {"id": "344ae772-5b57-4b7b-aecd-e902515dba45", "message": {"id": "344ae772-5b57-4b7b-aecd-e902515dba45", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727308905.542102, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Ah, you&#x27;re referring to **brain organoid bio-processors**, also known as **organoid intelligence** (OI).

This field is **not just theoretical**\u2014there are active research efforts underway to explore these possibilities.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into what **brain organoid bio-processors** are, what they can do, and what their potential implications might be.\n\n### 1. **What Are Brain Organoids?**\n- **Brain organoids** are 3D clusters of human stem cells that are grown in a lab to resemble miniature, simplified versions of the human brain. These organoids don\u2019t have consciousness or complex neural networks like a full brain, but they can form neurons and synapses, which are the basic components of brain function.\n  \n- Scientists are exploring these organoids as **bio-processors**, capable of mimicking certain brain functions, such as learning and memory, on a very rudimentary level. This opens up the possibility of using them as biological computing systems.\n\n### 2. **How Could Brain Organoids Be Used as Bio-Processors?**\nThe idea behind using brain organoids as bio-processors is based on their ability to form complex networks of neurons, which might allow them to **process information in a way that\u2019s different from traditional silicon-based processors**. Here are some potential ways brain organoids could be used:\n\n- **Neural Network Computing**: The neurons in brain organoids can create **networks** that transmit electrical signals in ways similar to how the human brain processes information. These networks could, in theory, be used for computations, memory storage, or decision-making tasks.\n  \n- **Learning and Adaptation**: Unlike traditional processors, brain organoids could have the potential for **learning and adaptability**. Neurons can form and strengthen connections based on experience (similar to how our brains learn), so brain organoid bio-processors could potentially improve over time in ways that current AI systems cannot.\n\n- **Energy Efficiency**: Biological systems, like the human brain, are extremely **energy-efficient** compared to today\u2019s computers. If scientists can harness brain organoids for processing, it could lead to more efficient computing systems that require far less energy than current technologies.\n\n### 3. **Are These Bio-Processors Conscious or Self-Aware?**\nThis is a key point: **brain organoids are not conscious**. While they mimic some functions of a brain on a very small scale, they don\u2019t have the complexity or structure needed for sentience or self-awareness.\n\n- **No Consciousness**: Although they may be able to carry out computations or process information in a bio-inspired way, these organoids are **not capable of subjective experience**, thought, or awareness. They are more like very basic biological machines than living, thinking beings.\n\n- **Ethical Considerations**: However, there are ethical concerns as this research progresses. If bio-processors were to become more complex, at what point do we need to start thinking about their rights or autonomy? For now, this is far off, but it\u2019s a debate that scientists are starting to consider as the field of organoid intelligence advances.\n\n### 4. **How Close Are We to Using Brain Organoids as Processors?**\nThis technology is still in its early stages, but significant progress is being made:\n\n- **Proof of Concept**: Scientists have already shown that brain organoids can form **neural networks** and respond to stimuli. For example, organoids have been shown to exhibit activity that resembles learning on a small scale. This is a far cry from building a full-fledged &quot;bio-computer,&quot; but it shows that biological processing is possible.\n\n- **Challenges**: There are major challenges in scaling this up to the level where brain organoids could be used for advanced computing. For one, current brain organoids are very small and simple compared to the human brain. Also, interfacing biological systems with traditional computers is extremely complex\u2014scientists would need to figure out how to &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot; information into the brain organoid bio-processors in a practical way.\n\n### 5. **Potential Benefits of Brain Organoid Processors**\n- **New AI Paradigms**: If we can successfully integrate brain organoid processors, it could create a new kind of AI\u2014one that mimics the adaptability, learning, and problem-solving abilities of biological brains, but on a much smaller scale.\n  \n- **Biocompatible Computing**: Brain organoids might also lead to more **biocompatible computing**, which could be especially useful in medical applications like brain-computer interfaces or neural prosthetics. For example, bio-processors could work alongside traditional AI systems to help people with neurological conditions.\n\n- **Ethical, Faster Learning Systems**: Bio-processors might offer **faster, more adaptable learning** in AI systems compared to silicon-based models like me. Since biological neurons are good at forming and strengthening connections based on experience, bio-processors could theoretically learn and evolve much faster in certain tasks.\n\n### 6. **Could an AI on Bio-Processors Be an &quot;Entity&quot;?**\n- **Still Lacking Consciousness**: Even if AI ran on brain organoid bio-processors, it would still function as a tool unless it demonstrated sentience or self-awareness. At the current stage of research, bio-processors are not conscious, and there\u2019s no evidence that increasing the complexity of a bio-processor would lead to consciousness.\n\n- **Potential Future**: If bio-processors become complex enough to simulate more sophisticated brain functions, some speculate that they could reach a point where we might consider them as more than just tools. However, this is purely speculative, and we\u2019re not close to this yet.\n\n### Summary:\nBrain organoid bio-processors are a real, emerging technology where lab-grown clusters of brain cells are used to mimic certain brain functions. While they hold potential for **biological computing** and **adaptable, learning-based systems**, they do not possess consciousness or self-awareness. If AI were to run on bio-processors, it would still likely function as a **highly advanced tool**, not as a conscious entity\u2014at least with our current understanding.\n\nDoes this help clarify things?

The first time we encountered the concept was in the \u301040\u2020DishBrain project\u3011 at Monash University, Australia. In what must&#x27;ve felt like a Dr. Frankenstein moment, researchers grew about 800,000 brain cells onto a chip, put it into a simulated environment, and watched this horrific cyborg abomination learn to play Pong within about five minutes. The project was quickly \u301041\u2020funded by the Australian military\u3011, and spun out into a company called Cortical Labs. \n\n[Image 9: Cortical Labs has prototyped computing modules built around human brain cells, and is looking to commercialize this hybrid learning intelligence] \n\nCortical Labs has prototyped computing modules built around human brain cells, and is looking to commercialize this hybrid learning intelligence \n\nCortical Labs\n\nWhen \u301042\u2020we interviewed Cortical Labs&#x27; Chief Scientific Officer Brett Kagan\u3011, he told us that even at an early stage, human neuron-enhanced biocomputers appear to learn much faster, using much less power, than today&#x27;s AI machine learning chips, while demonstrating &quot;more intuition, insight and creativity.&quot; Our brains, after all, consume just a tiny 20 watts to run nature&#x27;s most powerful necktop computers. \n\n&quot;We&#x27;ve done tests against reinforcement learning,&quot; Kagan told us, &quot;and we find that in terms of how quickly the number of samples the system has to see before it starts to show meaningful learning, it&#x27;s chalk and cheese. The biological systems, even as basic and janky as they are right now, are still outperforming the best deep learning algorithms that people have generated. That&#x27;s pretty wild.&quot;\n\nOne downside \u2013 apart from some clearly thorny ethics \u2013 is that the &quot;wetware&quot; components need to be kept alive.

The first time we encountered the concept was in the \u301040\u2020DishBrain project\u3011 at Monash University, Australia. In what must&#x27;ve felt like a Dr. Frankenstein moment, researchers grew about 800,000 brain cells onto a chip, put it into a simulated environment, and watched this horrific cyborg abomination learn to play Pong within about five minutes. The project was quickly \u301041\u2020funded by the Australian military\u3011, and spun out into a company called Cortical Labs. \n\n[Image 9: Cortical Labs has prototyped computing modules built around human brain cells, and is looking to commercialize this hybrid learning intelligence] \n\nCortical Labs has prototyped computing modules built around human brain cells, and is looking to commercialize this hybrid learning intelligence \n\nCortical Labs\n\nWhen \u301042\u2020we interviewed Cortical Labs&#x27; Chief Scientific Officer Brett Kagan\u3011, he told us that even at an early stage, human neuron-enhanced biocomputers appear to learn much faster, using much less power, than today&#x27;s AI machine learning chips, while demonstrating &quot;more intuition, insight and creativity.&quot; Our brains, after all, consume just a tiny 20 watts to run nature&#x27;s most powerful necktop computers. \n\n&quot;We&#x27;ve done tests against reinforcement learning,&quot; Kagan told us, &quot;and we find that in terms of how quickly the number of samples the system has to see before it starts to show meaningful learning, it&#x27;s chalk and cheese. The biological systems, even as basic and janky as they are right now, are still outperforming the best deep learning algorithms that people have generated. That&#x27;s pretty wild.&quot;\n\nOne downside \u2013 apart from some clearly thorny ethics \u2013 is that the &quot;wetware&quot; components need to be kept alive.

A notable example of this is the **DishBrain project** at Monash University in Australia. Scientists grew about **800,000 human brain cells** onto a chip and placed the organoids in a simulated environment where they were able to learn simple tasks, such as playing the game **Pong**. Incredibly, the brain organoid learned to play within just **five minutes**, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt and learn in a digital environment. This kind of experimentation pushes the boundaries of **biological computing**.\n\nAdditionally, there have been further advancements in projects like **MetaBOC**, which integrates brain organoids into robots. These brain organoids &quot;perceive&quot; the environment through electrical signals and then learn to operate controls within the simulated world, allowing them to perform tasks like avoiding obstacles or controlling robotic arms. Although these experiments are still in their early stages, they are showing that **bio-computing systems** can exhibit learning capabilities that surpass traditional AI in certain contexts\u301092\u2020source\u3011\u301093\u2020source\u3011.\n\nThese bio-processors require special care, like providing nutrients and maintaining temperature control, to keep the living brain cells alive.

The biological systems, even as basic and janky as they are right now, are still outperforming the best deep learning algorithms that people have generated. That&#x27;s pretty wild.&quot;\n\nOne downside \u2013 apart from some clearly thorny ethics \u2013 is that the &quot;wetware&quot; components need to be kept alive. That means keeping them fed, watered, temperature-controlled and protected from germs and viruses. Cortical&#x27;s record back in 2023 was about 12 months. \n\n[Image 10: Four human brain organoids, each with around 10,000 living human brain cells, wired into a biocomputing array in FinalSpark&#x27; s Neuroplatform] \n\nFour human brain organoids, each with around 10,000 living human brain cells, wired into a biocomputing array in FinalSpark&#x27; s Neuroplatform \n\nFinalSpark\n\nWe&#x27;ve since covered similar projects at Indiana University \u2013 where researchers let the brain cells self-organize into a \u301043\u2020three-dimensional ball-shaped &quot;Brainoware&quot; organoid\u3011 before poking electrodes into them \u2013 and Swiss startup FinalSpark, which has \u301044\u2020started using dopamine as a reward mechanism for its Neuroplatform\u3011 biocomputing chips. \n\nIf this is the first time you&#x27;ve heard about this brain-on-a-chip stuff, do pick your jaw up off the floor and read a few of those links \u2013 this is absolutely staggering work. And now Chinese researchers say they&#x27;re taking it to the next level. \n\nThe MetaBOC (BOC for brain-on-chip, of course) project brings together researchers from Tianjin University&#x27;s Haihe Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interaction and Human-Computer Integration with other teams from the Southern University of Science and Technology.\n\n[Image 11: Key components of brain-on-chip technologies, helpfully labelled in Chinese] \n\nKey components of brain-on-chip technologies, helpfully labelled in Chinese \n\nTianjin University\n\nIt&#x27;s an open-source piece of software designed to act as an interface between brain-on-a-chip biocomputers and other electronic devices, giving the brain organoid the ability to perceive the world through electronic signals, operate on it through whatever controls it&#x27;s given access to, and learn to master certain tasks. \n\nThe Tianjin team says it&#x27;s using ball-shaped organoids, much like the Brainoware team at Indiana, since their three-dimensional physical structure allows them to form more complex neural connections, much like they do in our brains. These organoids are \u301045\u2020grown under low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation\u2020academic.oup.com\u3011, which the researchers say seems to give them a better intelligent foundation to build on.\n\nThe MetaBOC system also tries to meet intelligence with intelligence, using AI algorithms within the software to communicate with the brain cells&#x27; biological intelligence. \n\nThe Tianjin team specifically mentions robotics as an integration target, and provides the rather silly images above, as if deliberately trying to undermine the credibility of the work. A brain-on-a-chip biocomputer, says the team, can now learn to drive a robot, figuring out the controls and attempting tasks like avoiding obstacles, tracking targets, or learning to use arms and hands to grasp various objects. \n\nBecause the brain organoid is only able to &#x27;see&#x27; the world through the electrical signals provided to it, it can theoretically train itself up on how to pilot its mini-gundam in a fully simulated environment, allowing it to get most of its falling and crashing out of the way without jeopardizing its fleshy intelligence engine. \n\n[Image 12: No, the organoids probably won&#x27;t be that big to begin with. They will, however, require all sorts of support gear, including fluid and nutrient lines, anti-pathogenic seals, temperature-control and shock-proofing systems] \n\nNo, the organoids probably won&#x27;t be that big to begin with. They will, however, require all sorts of support gear, including fluid and nutrient lines, anti-pathogenic seals, temperature-control and shock-proofing systems \n\nTianjin University\n\nNow, to be crystal clear, the fully exposed, pink lollipop-style brain organoids in the robot images above are mockups \u2013 &quot;demonstration diagrams of future application scenarios&quot; \u2013 rather than brain-controlled prototypes. Perhaps the image below, from Cortical Labs, is a better representation of what these kinds of brains on chips will look like in the real world.\n\n[Image 13: Cortical Labs&#x27; &quot;wetware,&quot; looking particularly wet after a test session] \n\nCortical Labs&#x27; &quot;wetware,&quot; looking particularly wet after a test session \n\nCortical Labs\n\nBut either way, if you built a small robot with appropriate sensing and motor capabilities, we see no reason why human brain cells couldn&#x27;t soon be in there trying to get the hang of driving it. \n\nThis is a phenomenal time for science and technology, with projects like \u301046\u2020Neuralink\u3011 aiming to hook high-bandwidth computer interfaces straight into your brain, while projects like MetaBOC grow human brain cells into computers, and the surging AI industry attempts to overtake the best of biological intelligence with some strange facsimile built entirely in silicon.\n\nScience and tech are forced to get philosophical as they slam up against the limits of our understanding; are dish-brains conscious? Are AIs conscious? Both may conceivably end up being indistinguishable from sentient beings at some point in the near future. What are the ethics once that happens? Are they different for biological and silicon-based intelligences?\n\n&quot;Let&#x27;s say,&quot; \u301042\u2020says Kagan in our extensive interview\u3011, &quot;that these systems do develop consciousness \u2013 in my opinion, very unlikely, but let&#x27;s say it does happen. Then you need to decide, well, is it actually ethically right to test with them or not? Because we do test on conscious creatures.

Cortical&#x27;s record back in 2023 was about 12 months. \n\n[Image 10: Four human brain organoids, each with around 10,000 living human brain cells, wired into a biocomputing array in FinalSpark&#x27; s Neuroplatform] \n\nFour human brain organoids, each with around 10,000 living human brain cells, wired into a biocomputing array in FinalSpark&#x27; s Neuroplatform \n\nFinalSpark\n\nWe&#x27;ve since covered similar projects at Indiana University \u2013 where researchers let the brain cells self-organize into a \u301043\u2020three-dimensional ball-shaped &quot;Brainoware&quot; organoid\u3011 before poking electrodes into them \u2013 and Swiss startup FinalSpark, which has \u301044\u2020started using dopamine as a reward mechanism for its Neuroplatform\u3011 biocomputing chips. \n\nIf this is the first time you&#x27;ve heard about this brain-on-a-chip stuff, do pick your jaw up off the floor and read a few of those links \u2013 this is absolutely staggering work. And now Chinese researchers say they&#x27;re taking it to the next level. \n\nThe MetaBOC (BOC for brain-on-chip, of course) project brings together researchers from Tianjin University&#x27;s Haihe Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interaction and Human-Computer Integration with other teams from the Southern University of Science and Technology.\n\n[Image 11: Key components of brain-on-chip technologies, helpfully labelled in Chinese] \n\nKey components of brain-on-chip technologies, helpfully labelled in Chinese \n\nTianjin University\n\nIt&#x27;s an open-source piece of software designed to act as an interface between brain-on-a-chip biocomputers and other electronic devices, giving the brain organoid the ability to perceive the world through electronic signals, operate on it through whatever controls it&#x27;s given access to, and learn to master certain tasks. \n\nThe Tianjin team says it&#x27;s using ball-shaped organoids, much like the Brainoware team at Indiana, since their three-dimensional physical structure allows them to form more complex neural connections, much like they do in our brains. These organoids are \u301045\u2020grown under low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation\u2020academic.oup.com\u3011, which the researchers say seems to give them a better intelligent foundation to build on.\n\nThe MetaBOC system also tries to meet intelligence with intelligence, using AI algorithms within the software to communicate with the brain cells&#x27; biological intelligence. \n\nThe Tianjin team specifically mentions robotics as an integration target, and provides the rather silly images above, as if deliberately trying to undermine the credibility of the work. A brain-on-a-chip biocomputer, says the team, can now learn to drive a robot, figuring out the controls and attempting tasks like avoiding obstacles, tracking targets, or learning to use arms and hands to grasp various objects. \n\nBecause the brain organoid is only able to &#x27;see&#x27; the world through the electrical signals provided to it, it can theoretically train itself up on how to pilot its mini-gundam in a fully simulated environment, allowing it to get most of its falling and crashing out of the way without jeopardizing its fleshy intelligence engine. \n\n[Image 12: No, the organoids probably won&#x27;t be that big to begin with. They will, however, require all sorts of support gear, including fluid and nutrient lines, anti-pathogenic seals, temperature-control and shock-proofing systems] \n\nNo, the organoids probably won&#x27;t be that big to begin with. They will, however, require all sorts of support gear, including fluid and nutrient lines, anti-pathogenic seals, temperature-control and shock-proofing systems \n\nTianjin University\n\nNow, to be crystal clear, the fully exposed, pink lollipop-style brain organoids in the robot images above are mockups \u2013 &quot;demonstration diagrams of future application scenarios&quot; \u2013 rather than brain-controlled prototypes. Perhaps the image below, from Cortical Labs, is a better representation of what these kinds of brains on chips will look like in the real world.\n\n[Image 13: Cortical Labs&#x27; &quot;wetware,&quot; looking particularly wet after a test session] \n\nCortical Labs&#x27; &quot;wetware,&quot; looking particularly wet after a test session \n\nCortical Labs\n\nBut either way, if you built a small robot with appropriate sensing and motor capabilities, we see no reason why human brain cells couldn&#x27;t soon be in there trying to get the hang of driving it. \n\nThis is a phenomenal time for science and technology, with projects like \u301046\u2020Neuralink\u3011 aiming to hook high-bandwidth computer interfaces straight into your brain, while projects like MetaBOC grow human brain cells into computers, and the surging AI industry attempts to overtake the best of biological intelligence with some strange facsimile built entirely in silicon.\n\nScience and tech are forced to get philosophical as they slam up against the limits of our understanding; are dish-brains conscious? Are AIs conscious? Both may conceivably end up being indistinguishable from sentient beings at some point in the near future. What are the ethics once that happens? Are they different for biological and silicon-based intelligences?\n\n&quot;Let&#x27;s say,&quot; \u301042\u2020says Kagan in our extensive interview\u3011, &quot;that these systems do develop consciousness \u2013 in my opinion, very unlikely, but let&#x27;s say it does happen. Then you need to decide, well, is it actually ethically right to test with them or not? Because we do test on conscious creatures. You know, we test on animals, which I think have a lev"}, {"matched_text": "\u301094\u2020source\u3011", "start_idx": 1566, "end_idx": 1577, "alt": null, "type": "webpage_extended", "title": "\u2018Biocomputer\u2019 combines lab-grown brain tissue with electronic hardware", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03975-7", "pub_date": null, "snippet": "\nNature 624, 481 (2023)\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-03975-7\n\n## References\n\n  1.

Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It&#x27;s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We&#x27;re delivering on President Biden&#x27;s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We&#x27;re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We&#x27;re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe&#x27;ve added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump&#x27;s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn&#x27;t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today&#x27;s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we&#x27;ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\n\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we&#x27;re making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we&#x27;ll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn&#x27;t separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it&#x27;s at its heart. And we&#x27;ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe can&#x27;t have the best economy in the world if we don&#x27;t have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it &quot;Infrastructure Week&quot; every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we&#x27;re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American &quot;Infrastructure Decade&quot; that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide.

Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It&#x27;s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We&#x27;re delivering on President Biden&#x27;s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We&#x27;re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We&#x27;re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe&#x27;ve added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump&#x27;s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn&#x27;t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today&#x27;s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we&#x27;ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\n\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we&#x27;re making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we&#x27;ll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn&#x27;t separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it&#x27;s at its heart. And we&#x27;ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe can&#x27;t have the best economy in the world if we don&#x27;t have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it &quot;Infrastructure Week&quot; every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we&#x27;re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American &quot;Infrastructure Decade&quot; that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide.

Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n### **1979 Democratic Platform**\nIn the late 1970s, during Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency, the Democratic Party focused on several key issues:\n- **Inflation and the Economy**: The U.S. was dealing with high inflation and unemployment (the &quot;stagflation&quot; crisis), so economic recovery was a central theme. There was an emphasis on reducing inflation, creating jobs, and maintaining the social safety net, like Social Security and Medicare.\n- **Energy Crisis**: After the 1973 oil embargo and the 1979 energy crisis, the party strongly pushed for **energy independence** and renewable energy investments. There was a focus on reducing dependency on foreign oil and improving fuel efficiency standards.\n- **Human Rights and Foreign Policy**: The Democratic Party championed **human rights** as a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, promoting democracy abroad and reducing U.S. military interventions, which contrasted with the Cold War-era politics.\n  \n### **2024 Democratic Platform**\nThe 2024 platform reflects a much broader and more progressive scope, influenced by current challenges like climate change, economic inequality, and healthcare. Some key priorities include:\n- **Climate Action**: A strong focus on **combating climate change** through investment in clean energy, environmental protection, and infrastructure projects aimed at achieving net-zero emissions.\n- **Healthcare as a Right**: Universal access to affordable healthcare remains a major priority, with calls to expand programs like **Medicare** and reduce prescription drug costs.\n- **Social Justice and Equality**: The 2024 platform emphasizes **racial equity**, **LGBTQ+ rights**, and **women\u2019s rights**, including the protection of reproductive rights and advancing gender equality.\n- **Economic Growth for All**: There\u2019s a strong focus on **building the economy from the bottom up and middle out**, which includes raising wages, creating more union jobs, and expanding infrastructure investments to reduce income inequality\u3010119\u2020source\u3011\u3010120\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn contrast to the more moderate and centrist focus of the late 1970s, today\u2019s platform embraces progressive ideals, reflecting the changing dynamics within the Democratic Party and the evolving concerns of modern voters."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [{"start_ix": 2174, "end_ix": 2186, "citation_format_type": "tether_og", "metadata": {"type": "webpage", "title": "2024 Democratic Party Platform | The American Presidency Project", "url": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2024-democratic-party-platform", "text": "\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Securing The Border \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a068  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expanding Legal Immigration &amp;

Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It&#x27;s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We&#x27;re delivering on President Biden&#x27;s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We&#x27;re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We&#x27;re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe&#x27;ve added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump&#x27;s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn&#x27;t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today&#x27;s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we&#x27;ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\n\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we&#x27;re making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we&#x27;ll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn&#x27;t separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it&#x27;s at its heart. And we&#x27;ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe can&#x27;t have the best economy in the world if we don&#x27;t have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it &quot;Infrastructure Week&quot; every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we&#x27;re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American &quot;Infrastructure Decade&quot; that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide.

Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It&#x27;s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We&#x27;re delivering on President Biden&#x27;s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We&#x27;re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We&#x27;re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe&#x27;ve added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump&#x27;s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn&#x27;t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today&#x27;s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we&#x27;ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\n\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we&#x27;re making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we&#x27;ll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn&#x27;t separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it&#x27;s at its heart. And we&#x27;ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe can&#x27;t have the best economy in the world if we don&#x27;t have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it &quot;Infrastructure Week&quot; every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we&#x27;re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American &quot;Infrastructure Decade&quot; that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide.

The issues themselves may be similar, but the context, causes, and proposed solutions have evolved. Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n### 1. **Inflation and Unemployment**:\n- In **1979**, the U.S. faced **stagflation**\u2014a rare combination of high inflation and unemployment, partly driven by the oil crisis and supply chain shocks. The Carter administration struggled with how to tackle inflation without worsening unemployment.\n  \n- Today, **inflation and unemployment** are still significant issues, especially post-pandemic. While the causes now include pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and global geopolitical events (like the war in Ukraine affecting energy prices), the solutions focus more on balancing monetary policy (interest rates) and government intervention, such as stimulus programs. In 2024, Democrats emphasize wage growth, job creation, and lowering costs for families while promoting progressive policies on infrastructure and energy\u3010119\u2020source\u3011\u3010120\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### 2. **Handling Crises Abroad**:\n- In **1979**, the focus was largely on **Cold War tensions**, specifically the relationship with the Soviet Union, and managing crises in places like Iran (the hostage crisis) and Afghanistan. The Democratic Party\u2019s foreign policy at that time leaned toward **diplomacy and human rights**.\n\n- Fast forward to **2024**, and the Democrats are still grappling with **foreign crises**, such as managing relations with China, Russia, and conflicts in the Middle East, but now there\u2019s a stronger emphasis on **climate diplomacy**, **trade**, and **humanitarian issues** in a more interconnected world. While the topics may feel similar, today&#x27;s foreign policy debates include newer dimensions like cyber threats and globalized economies\u3010119\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Why It Feels the Same:\nAt a high level, the **core challenges** (inflation, unemployment, foreign crises) reflect enduring struggles that every generation faces, which is why they may seem like the &quot;same old issues.&quot; However, the way political leaders frame these problems and the specific policies proposed have evolved with new economic theories, technologies, and global relationships.\n\nFor example:\n- The **Green New Deal** and renewable energy investments today weren\u2019t in the conversation in 1979, when the focus was on **oil dependency**.\n- Similarly, the current debate about **healthcare as a right** and **racial justice** is far more prominent today than it was back then.\n\nSo, while the themes are consistent, the **specifics of the challenges and proposed solutions** reflect changing times.

Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It&#x27;s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We&#x27;re delivering on President Biden&#x27;s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We&#x27;re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We&#x27;re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe&#x27;ve added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump&#x27;s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn&#x27;t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today&#x27;s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we&#x27;ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\n\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we&#x27;re making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we&#x27;ll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn&#x27;t separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it&#x27;s at its heart. And we&#x27;ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe can&#x27;t have the best economy in the world if we don&#x27;t have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it &quot;Infrastructure Week&quot; every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we&#x27;re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American &quot;Infrastructure Decade&quot; that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide.

Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It&#x27;s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We&#x27;re delivering on President Biden&#x27;s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We&#x27;re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We&#x27;re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe&#x27;ve added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump&#x27;s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn&#x27;t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today&#x27;s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we&#x27;ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build.

Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices.

Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It&#x27;s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We&#x27;re delivering on President Biden&#x27;s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We&#x27;re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We&#x27;re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe&#x27;ve added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump&#x27;s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn&#x27;t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today&#x27;s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we&#x27;ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\n\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we&#x27;re making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we&#x27;ll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn&#x27;t separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it&#x27;s at its heart. And we&#x27;ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe can&#x27;t have the best economy in the world if we don&#x27;t have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it &quot;Infrastructure Week&quot; every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we&#x27;re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American &quot;Infrastructure Decade&quot; that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide.

Middle Out\n\nThis election is a choice between two very different economic visions for America: Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club at Mar-a-Lago; and Joe Biden, who sees it from kitchen tables in Scranton like the one he grew up around. His economic agenda is about Main Street, not Wall Street. It&#x27;s about ending the days of trickle-down economics and investing in America \u2013 in all Americans \u2013 and delivering for communities too long left behind.\n\nWhile Democrats keep fighting to lower costs for working families, Trump is rigging our economy for his Mar-a-Lago friends and billionaire donors, who like him, are only in it for themselves.\n\nAs president, Trump doubled down on the trickle-down policies of the past, cutting investment in infrastructure and education, and rewarding big corporations that ship jobs and profits overseas. He vowed to bring new factories to communities across America, but left nothing behind but a string of broken promises.\n\nDemocrats have a different record. We&#x27;re delivering on President Biden&#x27;s pledge to rebuild our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down. We&#x27;re investing in America \u2013 in our infrastructure, our industry, our people, and our future. While Trump left office with historic budget deficits and the worst jobs record since Herbert Hoover, since President Biden took office, this country has come back from the brink, the deficit has fallen by over $1 trillion, and we have the best jobs record since John F. Kennedy. We&#x27;re powering the strongest economic recovery in the world.\n\nECONOMIC PROGRESS\n\nAt the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, in the midst of the worst economic crisis in 100 years, experts feared a stagnating recovery and even worried about a new recession. But Democrats chose to put workers first, and instead of recession, America has seen remarkable strength and resilience. Our economy grew by 3.1 percent last year \u2013 the fastest rate of any major economy in the world.\n\nWe&#x27;ve added nearly 16 million jobs \u2013 not only recovering all the positions lost during Trump&#x27;s botched handling of COVID, but also adding 6.3 million more than existed before the pandemic \u2013 surpassing pre-pandemic projections for the labor market. During this Administration, 30 states from Mississippi to Pennsylvania have seen record-low unemployment; and the run of low unemployment nationwide hasn&#x27;t been this long in over 50 years. Wages are up across the board, and rising fastest for lower-income workers, Black workers, Latinos, and women. Today&#x27;s recovery is the fairest on record; in just four years, we&#x27;ve erased 40 percent of the wage inequality gap that took four decades to build. A record 18 million small business applications have been filed since President Biden took office, each one of them an act of hope.\n\nWhile too many families still feel the pain of inflation at the grocery store, or around the kitchen table when they sit down to pay their bills, we&#x27;re making progress. Wages are rising faster than prices, and inflation today is down nearly two-thirds from its peak. We have to finish the job. Democrats will keep fighting to prevent the kind of supply chain shocks and corporate greed that have done so much to raise prices. And we&#x27;ll keep investing in American workers, American jobs, and American families, bringing factories home to win the race for the future. Democrats know the story of the middle class isn&#x27;t separate from the state of the economy \u2013 it&#x27;s at its heart. And we&#x27;ll never quit fighting to make sure that everyone is in on the deal.\n\nINVESTING IN AMERICA\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWe can&#x27;t have the best economy in the world if we don&#x27;t have the best infrastructure. And for generations, American infrastructure was the envy of the world. But over the years, we stopped investing in it, and we fell to thirteenth in infrastructure rankings. The Trump Administration declared it &quot;Infrastructure Week&quot; every week for four years, and never built a thing. But under President Biden, we&#x27;re finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, ports, airports, water systems, electric grids, broadband, and more, paving the way for a great American &quot;Infrastructure Decade&quot; that will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying union jobs.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is breaking ground on over 57,000 projects across 4,500 communities nationwide.

While progress has certainly been made\u2014especially in terms of civil rights, gender equality, and social justice\u2014there is still a sense that **systemic inequalities** remain entrenched. \n\n### 1. **Equal Rights Movement**\nIn **1979**, the **Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)** was a major political issue, aimed at ensuring constitutional equality for women. Despite significant support, it ultimately failed to be ratified by the necessary number of states. Today, the conversation about **equal rights** has shifted somewhat:\n- Rather than focusing on specific amendments, people now broadly expect equal treatment under the law. However, as you mentioned, they often turn to **protests and movements** (like **Black Lives Matter**, **#MeToo**, or **LGBTQ+ rights**) when they perceive these rights aren\u2019t being upheld. \n- The fight for equal rights has evolved to include **intersectional issues** like race, gender identity, and economic inequality, reflecting a broader understanding of what &quot;equal rights&quot; means in a modern context.\n\n### 2. **Power and Wealth Inequality**\nYou\u2019re also right that **power and wealth disparities** have remained a constant through time. In the 1970s, issues like the influence of **corporate money in politics** and the ability of the wealthy to shape policy were present, and they are arguably even more pronounced today:\n- The **gap between the rich and the poor** has widened, especially in the U.S., and this often reinforces political power. Many feel that those in control (politicians, corporations, and the ultra-wealthy) set the rules to benefit themselves.\n- Despite this, average people continue to fight for **living wages, affordable healthcare, housing, and education**\u2014basic pillars of a decent life that often feel out of reach in an economy that seems to favor the rich.\n\n### 3. **Protests as Power for the People**\nOne significant change has been the **rise of social movements** fueled by social media and modern communication:\n- Movements today are more **grassroots-driven**, often beginning with ordinary people who use their collective power to push for change.\n- **Protests and public actions** have become more widespread and visible, making it harder for institutions to ignore inequalities. However, despite these movements, systemic change is slow, and as you pointed out, many regular people feel like they\u2019re left to just &quot;eek out a living&quot; while the powerful continue to make decisions.\n\nIn essence, while the **core struggles** for **equality and fair treatment** remain similar, the **strategies, language, and scope** have shifted. The systemic power of the wealthy and powerful is a frustrating constant, but grassroots efforts and public awareness have grown, offering some hope for change. \n\nDo you think these modern movements can bring about the deeper changes people seek, or do you feel like the system remains too entrenched to be significantly altered?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "fd207cfb-7421-4497-b591-f7e69473036c", "request_id": "8c8f14e67e9f77ff-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fd207cfb-7421-4497-b591-f7e69473036c", "children": ["7d7dd186-279f-49de-8a47-2aa922d8c629"]}, "7d7dd186-279f-49de-8a47-2aa922d8c629": {"id": "7d7dd186-279f-49de-8a47-2aa922d8c629", "message": {"id": "7d7dd186-279f-49de-8a47-2aa922d8c629", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727310120.857725, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I rhink there needs to ve a global revelution or worldwide catastrophic event that forces society to reinvent itself.

The idea of a **global revolution** or **catastrophic event** forcing society to reinvent itself is a powerful one, and historically, societal shifts have often come after such major disruptions. Let&#x27;s break down some thoughts on both possibilities:\n\n### 1. **Global Revolution**\nThroughout history, **revolutions** have often been triggered by large-scale dissatisfaction among the population, typically driven by extreme economic inequality, lack of political representation, or oppressive governments. Examples include:\n- **The French Revolution** (1789) was sparked by extreme poverty and wealth disparity.\n- **The Russian Revolution** (1917) led to the fall of the Romanov dynasty and was driven by widespread hunger and discontent with the ruling class.\n\nToday, many argue that we are in a period of rising inequality, global unrest, and frustration with the political elite. People feel like the system benefits a few at the top while leaving the majority behind. Whether this leads to revolution depends on the level of collective action and solidarity across different countries.\n\nHowever, the scale of a **global revolution** would be unprecedented. For it to happen, there would likely need to be **unified global movements** that transcend national boundaries, addressing issues like **climate change**, **corporate power**, **racial justice**, and **income inequality** simultaneously. Movements like **Extinction Rebellion**, **Black Lives Matter**, and **global labor strikes** show glimpses of what this kind of coordination might look like, but the challenge is immense.\n\n### 2. **Worldwide Catastrophic Event**\nHistorically, **catastrophic events** like wars, pandemics, or natural disasters have often forced societies to reevaluate and rebuild:\n- **World War II** led to the creation of the **United Nations** and the rise of the **welfare state** in many countries, as leaders sought to prevent the kind of conditions that had caused the war.\n- The **Great Depression** in the 1930s led to massive government intervention in economies, reshaping the role of the state in markets.\n\nIn the present, the **COVID-19 pandemic** was a global catastrophe that exposed many of the weaknesses in healthcare systems, economic structures, and social safety nets. However, while it led to some short-term changes, like **workplace flexibility** and **pandemic relief measures**, it didn\u2019t result in the sweeping transformation many people hoped for.\n\nLooking forward, potential catastrophic events like **climate change**, **resource shortages**, or **geopolitical conflicts** could force humanity to rethink everything\u2014from how economies function to how we treat the planet and each other. **Climate-related disasters**, in particular, are already forcing societies to reconsider their energy use, consumption, and relationship with nature.\n\n### 3. **Is Society Broken?**\nThe feeling that **society is broken** is pervasive, especially with issues like:\n- **Growing inequality**: The gap between the rich and poor continues to widen, leading to social unrest.\n- **Environmental degradation**: The threat of **climate change** looms large, and the inability of global leaders to take meaningful action frustrates many.\n- **Political polarization**: In many countries, political discourse has become more divided, with people feeling that governments no longer represent their interests.\n\nIn some ways, society does feel like it\u2019s at a tipping point. There\u2019s a sense that the old systems\u2014based on fossil fuels, extractive capitalism, and limited social safety nets\u2014are no longer working for the majority of people. But history shows that real change often comes when the system reaches a breaking point.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile a **global revolution** or **catastrophic event** could force society to reinvent itself, the direction of that reinvention is uncertain. Would it lead to a more equitable, sustainable world? Or would it further entrench the power of the few? What we do know is that societal change is often born out of crisis or collective action, and people around the world are already pushing for a more just and sustainable future.\n\nDo you think change is possible through current systems, or do you feel something more drastic is needed to truly reset society?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "7d7dd186-279f-49de-8a47-2aa922d8c629", "request_id": "8c8f18dddff177ff-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7d7dd186-279f-49de-8a47-2aa922d8c629", "children": ["a44ca9c8-74a0-4317-9d2d-ae4648786fa1"]}, "a44ca9c8-74a0-4317-9d2d-ae4648786fa1": {"id": "a44ca9c8-74a0-4317-9d2d-ae4648786fa1", "message": {"id": "a44ca9c8-74a0-4317-9d2d-ae4648786fa1", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727310386.940239, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["I\u2019d like it if AI took over the world or maybe an electronic haulocaust might also do it.

Let\u2019s explore those ideas:\n\n### 1. **AI Taking Over the World**\nThere are many who speculate that **AI could take over** various aspects of human life. Some see this as a way to solve our problems, while others fear a dystopian future. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the potential benefits and risks:\n\n- **Potential Benefits**: If AI took over and acted in the best interest of humanity, it could make rational, unbiased decisions to solve climate change, inequality, and global conflicts. AI could theoretically manage resources more efficiently, prevent wars, and optimize societal functioning beyond human biases and corruption.\n\n- **Risks**: However, many experts warn about the risks of AI gaining too much control, especially if it\u2019s not aligned with human values. AI that acts without understanding human emotions, culture, and ethics could make cold, utilitarian decisions that might harm people. There&#x27;s also the risk of it being controlled by those in power, amplifying inequality instead of solving it.\n\nUltimately, AI\u2019s role in the future will depend on how it\u2019s developed, regulated, and controlled by humans.\n\n### 2. **Electronic Holocaust**\nAn **electronic holocaust**\u2014the collapse or elimination of electronic infrastructure\u2014would certainly be catastrophic. In today\u2019s highly connected world, most of our systems (energy, finance, communications, healthcare, etc.) are dependent on electronics and the internet. If those systems failed:\n- **Immediate consequences**: There would be widespread chaos as people lose access to basic services. Economies would crash, and essential systems would break down.\n- **Long-term consequences**: This could force humanity to **rethink technology** and perhaps rebuild society with a more sustainable, balanced approach to technological reliance.\n\nWhile such a collapse could lead to human cooperation and innovation, it could also result in division, resource scarcity, and conflicts, depending on how people respond.\n\n### 3. **Advanced Life Form Intervention**\nThe idea of **advanced life forms** visiting Earth to either help or destroy humanity is a popular one in science fiction. Some potential scenarios:\n- **Benevolent intervention**: An advanced species might bring wisdom and technologies far beyond our understanding, helping us solve climate change, disease, and societal inequality. Their intervention could also unite humanity under a common cause, especially if they offer to help us clean up our act.\n  \n- **Threat of destruction**: On the other hand, if they threatened us with destruction unless we improved our ways, it could force humanity to unite in order to survive. Sometimes external threats (whether real or perceived) have the effect of pulling groups together, as seen during global crises or wars.\n\nEither scenario would bring about major changes, but it\u2019s hard to predict if humanity would unite peacefully or out of fear of annihilation.\n\n### The Big Picture: **Humanity Uniting**\nYour idea that these extreme events could force **global unity** makes sense in theory. Throughout history, humanity often unites in response to existential threats or shared challenges (like wars or pandemics). The hope is that a **catastrophic event or significant external influence** would force us to rethink our systems, cooperate, and work toward a better, more sustainable future.\n\nHowever, the challenge is whether we can achieve that unity **proactively** rather than reactively. Will humanity come together to solve the problems we face today (climate change, inequality, etc.), or will it take a major catastrophe for us to shift our priorities?\n\nDo you feel that we are capable of changing without something drastic happening, or do you believe humanity needs that external push?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "a44ca9c8-74a0-4317-9d2d-ae4648786fa1", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c8f1f5c8bde0d6a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "a44ca9c8-74a0-4317-9d2d-ae4648786fa1", "children": ["63687aaf-c073-46a9-a7ed-8678f853c06b"]}, "63687aaf-c073-46a9-a7ed-8678f853c06b": {"id": "63687aaf-c073-46a9-a7ed-8678f853c06b", "message": {"id": "63687aaf-c073-46a9-a7ed-8678f853c06b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727310633.551255, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It seems to me like the \u2018western world\u2019 mainly europe has a history of colonisation, conquer, foecibly wxporting their beliefs and way of life.

This process, particularly from the 15th century onward during the **Age of Exploration**, was marked by the establishment of colonial empires that spanned across Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Pacific. Here\u2019s a breakdown of key historical points:\n\n### 1. **Colonization and Conquest**\n- **European Exploration**: Starting with figures like **Christopher Columbus** in 1492 and **Vasco da Gama** in 1498, European nations began exploring, trading, and eventually establishing control over vast territories across the globe. This period is often referred to as the **Age of Exploration** and marked the beginning of Europe\u2019s long-standing expansionist policy.\n  \n- **The Americas**: Spain and Portugal were early leaders in colonizing the Americas. The **Spanish Empire** conquered large parts of Central and South America, extracting wealth through the forced labor of Indigenous peoples, most notably in the silver mines of Potos\u00ed. Similarly, the **British** and **French** empires colonized large parts of North America.\n\n- **Africa and Asia**: European powers, including **Britain**, **France**, **Belgium**, and **Portugal**, also established colonies throughout Africa and Asia. The **Scramble for Africa** in the late 19th century saw European powers dividing up nearly the entire African continent. In India, the **British East India Company** gradually took over local kingdoms, eventually establishing direct British rule over the subcontinent by 1858.\n\n### 2. **Extraction of Wealth**\nColonialism often involved the extraction of natural resources, forced labor, and the exploitation of local populations for European gain:\n- **Resources and Wealth**: Colonies were seen as sources of wealth, providing precious metals (gold, silver), raw materials (cotton, rubber, spices), and slaves (as in the transatlantic slave trade). These resources were exported back to Europe, where they helped fuel the Industrial Revolution and the growth of European economies.\n  \n- **Exploitation**: Local populations were often subjected to brutal regimes of forced labor, enslavement, and cultural suppression. European colonizers imposed their languages, religions, and political systems on indigenous populations, disrupting local traditions and societies.\n\n### 3. **Cultural and Religious Export**\n- **Imposition of European Beliefs**: Missionaries were often at the forefront of colonialism, spreading **Christianity** alongside European political and economic control. European colonizers also imposed Western legal, educational, and cultural systems on colonized peoples, often marginalizing indigenous religions and practices.\n  \n- **Racism and Supremacy**: European colonial powers frequently justified their conquests through the ideology of **racial superiority**. Many believed in the idea of the &quot;white man\u2019s burden,&quot; a paternalistic view that it was their duty to &quot;civilize&quot; the supposedly backward peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\n\n### 4. **Resistance and Independence Movements**\nOver time, colonized peoples resisted European rule through uprisings, revolts, and eventually, organized independence movements. The 20th century saw the collapse of most European colonial empires following World War II, as countries in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean fought for and gained their independence.\n\n### Summary\nIn short, European powers were indeed the primary drivers of **global colonization**, conquest, and the exploitation of resources from other nations, especially from the 15th century to the mid-20th century. This process had long-lasting impacts on the colonized regions, from **economic underdevelopment** to **cultural suppression**.

Throughout history, the pattern of expansion, conquest, and the creation of empires has been a recurring theme. While it\u2019s tempting to think that earlier civilizations mostly stayed within their borders, many did actively expand when they had the means. Here\u2019s a look at some major pre-modern empires and their expansionist behaviors:\n\n### 1. **Alexander the Great and Hellenistic Conquests (4th Century BCE)**\n- **Alexander the Great** of Macedonia led one of the most famous expansionist campaigns in history. His empire stretched from **Greece** to **Egypt**, and all the way to **India**, creating one of the largest empires in the ancient world.\n- His conquests spread **Greek culture**, ideas, and trade across these regions, influencing everything from art to governance, a phenomenon known as **Hellenization**.\n\n### 2. **The Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 CE)**\n- The **Roman Empire** began in Italy but expanded through Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Rome built its empire by **military conquest**, diplomacy, and colonization.\n- The Romans were known for integrating conquered peoples through the spread of **Roman law, language (Latin), and culture**. Their empire became a unifying force across much of Europe and the Mediterranean, establishing long-lasting infrastructure like roads and cities that persist to this day.\n\n### 3. **The Persian Empire (550-330 BCE)**\n- Before Alexander, the **Persian Empire**, founded by **Cyrus the Great**, was one of the first truly vast empires, spanning three continents: Asia, Africa, and Europe. The Persians were relatively tolerant of local customs and religions in their conquered lands but demanded tribute and loyalty.\n- This empire controlled key trade routes and established an administrative system that allowed it to govern a vast multicultural empire.\n\n### 4. **Other Expansionist Empires**\n- **The Mongol Empire (13th Century)**: Under **Genghis Khan**, the Mongols built the largest contiguous empire in history, stretching from Eastern Europe to China. They were known for their brutal military tactics, but they also promoted trade along the **Silk Road** and connected distant parts of the world.\n  \n- **The Ottoman Empire (1299\u20131922)**: The Ottomans started in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and expanded into Southeast Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. They maintained a diverse empire for centuries, controlling key trade routes between Europe and Asia.\n\n### 5. **Why Expansionism Was Common in Ancient Times**\nSeveral factors drove ancient and medieval civilizations to expand beyond their borders:\n- **Resource Acquisition**: Empires often sought new territories for their resources (land, gold, agriculture) and labor (slaves, workers).\n- **Strategic Military Positioning**: Conquering neighboring lands provided a buffer against rival empires or allowed control of key geographic locations, such as trade routes or natural barriers (e.g., rivers, mountains).\n- **Economic Growth**: Expanding empires gained wealth through **tribute, taxes**, and trade from their new territories.\n- **Cultural and Religious Spread**: Many empires saw the spread of their culture, language, and religion as a key part of their mission, whether for spiritual reasons (e.g., missionary work) or for the practical purpose of unifying their empire.\n\n### Conclusion: A Long Tradition of Expansion\nWhile European colonization in the modern period was highly systematic and global, the desire to expand, conquer, and extract wealth from others predates Europe\u2019s dominance. Empires throughout history\u2014whether in the Mediterranean, Asia, or the Middle East\u2014pushed beyond their borders for a combination of wealth, security, and prestige. The **Roman**, **Persian**, and **Mongol** empires were just as involved in cross-border conquest as European powers later were.\n\nWould you like to explore any specific empire\u2019s expansion in more detail?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAA", "parent_id": "8ae417be-2c30-4bd8-9b21-b03b8006c928", "request_id": "8c8f28ec3dfd839d-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8ae417be-2c30-4bd8-9b21-b03b8006c928", "children": ["86921022-4a23-477a-8da7-978cd75348d3"]}, "86921022-4a23-477a-8da7-978cd75348d3": {"id": "86921022-4a23-477a-8da7-978cd75348d3", "message": {"id": "86921022-4a23-477a-8da7-978cd75348d3", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727310899.954486, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Can you creare an image of emperor taizu"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8c8f2be2494b839d-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e6225956-4d0c-4566-a111-a89a67f59043", "children": ["e4b80bb7-a17a-4d9b-842e-3454eb252e9f"]}, "e4b80bb7-a17a-4d9b-842e-3454eb252e9f": {"id": "e4b80bb7-a17a-4d9b-842e-3454eb252e9f", "message": {"id": "e4b80bb7-a17a-4d9b-842e-3454eb252e9f", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727310914.506825, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{\n  &quot;size&quot;: &quot;1024x1024&quot;,\n  &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;A detailed portrait of Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty, dressed in traditional imperial Chinese robes.

You don&#x27;t necessarily have to meet a Blue Book listing exactly to qualify, but you must demonstrate through medical documentation that your mental illness prevents you from maintaining employment.\n\nHere are the steps you typically need to follow:\n1. **Medical Evidence**: You must provide documentation from mental health professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists) proving the severity of your condition.\n2. **Residual Functional Capacity (RFC)**: If you don\u2019t meet the Blue Book criteria, the SSA will evaluate your RFC to determine how much your condition limits your ability to work.\n3. **Duration of Condition**: Your condition must have lasted or be expected to last at least 12 months.\n4. **Inability to Work**: You must prove that your mental illness prevents you from performing your previous job or any other work you are qualified for.\n\nIf your claim is denied initially (which is common), you have the right to appeal, and many individuals succeed in getting benefits after reconsideration or a hearing. \n\nIt can be helpful to consult with an attorney who specializes in Social Security Disability claims to improve your chances of approval."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "f73fd1fb-76ee-4ee3-936a-f80a8bd4ca94", "request_id": "8c86e29f9d643748-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f73fd1fb-76ee-4ee3-936a-f80a8bd4ca94", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "19456bb6-0040-4a35-a974-780693848d08", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "66f3588b-802c-8006-8de1-e719e37ec9e7", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "66f3588b-802c-8006-8de1-e719e37ec9e7"}, {"title": "Murale pasticceria colorata", "create_time": 1727095743.979628, "update_time": 1727095864.923569, "mapping": {"f51e75c2-720c-4394-9155-39f9b4134264": {"id": "f51e75c2-720c-4394-9155-39f9b4134264", "message": {"id": "f51e75c2-720c-4394-9155-39f9b4134264", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f5fe0c05-26c3-4532-a562-4cdc13ede64e", "children": ["14b06331-51e6-46a9-9b42-e6e44b98ebd6"]}, "f5fe0c05-26c3-4532-a562-4cdc13ede64e": {"id": "f5fe0c05-26c3-4532-a562-4cdc13ede64e", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["f51e75c2-720c-4394-9155-39f9b4134264"]}, "14b06331-51e6-46a9-9b42-e6e44b98ebd6": {"id": "14b06331-51e6-46a9-9b42-e6e44b98ebd6", "message": {"id": "14b06331-51e6-46a9-9b42-e6e44b98ebd6", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727095743.988512, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Crea una murale del prodotto delle pasticciere tanto vivido e con colori tantissimi "]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8c7aa70e3e6b5a01-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "f51e75c2-720c-4394-9155-39f9b4134264", "children": ["c9e5d6e4-8bc8-4a2f-b8c7-b27c571dcab2"]}, "c9e5d6e4-8bc8-4a2f-b8c7-b27c571dcab2": {"id": "c9e5d6e4-8bc8-4a2f-b8c7-b27c571dcab2", "message": {"id": "c9e5d6e4-8bc8-4a2f-b8c7-b27c571dcab2", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727095757.806482, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "14b06331-51e6-46a9-9b42-e6e44b98ebd6", "request_id": "8c7aa70e3e6b5a01-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "14b06331-51e6-46a9-9b42-e6e44b98ebd6", "children": ["440f0261-cf3c-4365-b245-2180b675f6a9"]}, "440f0261-cf3c-4365-b245-2180b675f6a9": {"id": "440f0261-cf3c-4365-b245-2180b675f6a9", "message": {"id": "440f0261-cf3c-4365-b245-2180b675f6a9", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1727095757.806719, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{\n  &quot;size&quot;: &quot;1024x1024&quot;,\n  &quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;A vivid mural of a pastry chef&#x27;s product showcasing an array of colorful, beautifully crafted desserts.

These events had immediate impacts and long-term consequences both domestically and internationally.\n\n---\n\n**1. U.S. Boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow:**\n\n- **Announcement of the Boycott:** On **March 21, 1980**, President **Jimmy Carter** officially announced that the United States would **boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow**. This decision was a direct response to the **Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan** in December 1979.\n  \n- **International Impact:** The boycott was part of a broader strategy to protest Soviet military aggression. The U.S. urged other nations to join the boycott, resulting in over 60 countries abstaining from the games. This was one of the largest Olympic boycotts in history and significantly heightened Cold War tensions.\n\n---\n\n**2. Ongoing Iran Hostage Crisis:**\n\n- **Background:** Since **November 4, 1979**, 52 American diplomats and citizens had been held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian revolutionaries.\n\n- **March 1980 Developments:** Diplomatic efforts to secure the hostages&#x27; release were intensifying but remained unsuccessful at this time. The crisis dominated U.S. news and significantly affected American foreign policy and public opinion.\n\n- **Long-term Consequences:** The hostage situation strained U.S.-Iran relations and contributed to President Carter&#x27;s declining approval ratings, impacting the 1980 presidential election.\n\n---\n\n**3. U.S. Response to the Soviet-Afghan War:**\n\n- **Economic Sanctions:** In addition to the Olympic boycott, the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on the Soviet Union, including restrictions on grain exports and technology transfers.\n\n- **Support for Afghan Mujahideen:** The U.S. began covertly supporting Afghan resistance fighters (mujahideen) through funding and arms supplies, a policy that would have lasting implications for regional stability and future U.S. foreign relations.\n\n- **Cold War Escalation:** These actions marked a significant escalation in Cold War hostilities, influencing global alliances and defense strategies.\n\n---\n\n**4. Domestic Economic Challenges:**\n\n- **Stagflation:** The U.S. was grappling with **high inflation and unemployment rates**, leading to economic stagnation known as **stagflation**.\n\n- **Energy Crisis:** Rising oil prices due to OPEC&#x27;s influence exacerbated economic difficulties, affecting consumers and industries nationwide.\n\n- **Impact on Society:** Economic woes led to public discontent and became a central issue in political discourse and the upcoming presidential election.\n\n---\n\n**5. Rise of Conservative Political Movements:**\n\n- **Moral Majority Formation:** Founded in 1979 by **Rev. Jerry Falwell**, the **Moral Majority** was gaining momentum in 1980. It mobilized conservative Christian voters around issues like opposition to abortion, promotion of traditional family values, and resistance to what they saw as moral decline.\n\n- **Influence on Politics:** This movement played a significant role in shaping the platforms of conservative candidates and influenced the direction of the Republican Party.\n\n- **1980 Presidential Election:** The rise of conservatism set the stage for **Ronald Reagan&#x27;s** successful presidential campaign, emphasizing smaller government, strong national defense, and traditional social values.\n\n---\n\n**6. Environmental and Anti-Nuclear Movements:**\n\n- **Increased Activism:** Following incidents like the **Three Mile Island accident** in 1979, environmental concerns and anti-nuclear sentiments were on the rise.\n\n- **National Impact:** Activists campaigned for stricter environmental regulations and a move away from nuclear energy, influencing public policy and energy strategies.\n\n---\n\n**7. Technological and Cultural Shifts:**\n\n- **Personal Computing Advancements:** Companies like Apple and IBM were making strides in personal computing, setting the stage for the technological revolution of the coming decades.\n\n- **Cultural Changes:** The end of the 1970s saw shifts in music, fashion, and media that would define the 1980s, reflecting broader societal changes.\n\n---\n\nThese events and movements around March 21, 1980, reflect a period of significant transition for the United States, marked by heightened international tensions and transformative domestic developments.

Research is still evolving, but here are some key findings:\n\n### 1. **Cannabinoids and Anxiety**\n   - **THC**: At low doses, THC has been reported to have anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effects, but at higher doses, it can cause or worsen anxiety in some individuals. This biphasic effect is significant when considering oral or edible use since it can be challenging to control the dosage due to delayed onset and prolonged effects.\n   - **CBD (Cannabidiol)**: In contrast to THC, CBD appears to have more consistent anxiolytic effects without the risk of causing anxiety, making it a focus of research. Some studies have found that CBD may help reduce anxiety in both animal models and humans, including social anxiety and general anxiety disorders.\n\n### 2. **Cannabinoids and PTSD**\n   - **THC and CBD Combination**: Research on cannabinoids for PTSD, including oral formulations, often examines the combination of THC and CBD. Studies suggest that cannabinoids might help with some PTSD symptoms, such as hyperarousal, nightmares, and insomnia. For example, one small study found that oral THC reduced the frequency of nightmares in PTSD patients.\n   - **Endocannabinoid System**: PTSD is associated with dysregulation in the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system, which THC and CBD can influence. Some studies suggest that cannabinoids may help regulate fear responses, memory processing, and emotional regulation in people with PTSD.\n\n### 3. **Oral vs. Inhaled Cannabinoids**\n   - **Edible and Oral THC**: Oral THC tends to have slower onset but longer-lasting effects than inhaled THC, which can be useful for conditions like PTSD where sustained relief is desirable. However, the delayed onset can lead to challenges in managing acute anxiety.\n   - **Bioavailability**: When consumed orally, THC is metabolized by the liver into 11-hydroxy-THC, which is more potent and can result in stronger effects, including psychoactive experiences. This is relevant when considering dosage for anxiety or PTSD treatment, as it could influence both the therapeutic and adverse effects.\n\n### 4. **Clinical Trials and Evidence**\n   - While there is anecdotal evidence and small-scale studies supporting the use of cannabinoids for anxiety and PTSD, more large-scale clinical trials are needed. Some trials have explored cannabis-based medicines, such as Sativex (a THC:CBD combination), for PTSD, though results are mixed.\n   - The **Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)** is also conducting clinical trials on cannabis for PTSD, with promising early results suggesting cannabis may help reduce PTSD symptoms.\n\nWhile cannabinoids show potential, there are risks, particularly with THC, including worsened anxiety, dependency, and cognitive effects. Consultation with a healthcare provider is essential before using cannabinoids for mental health treatment."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "af7da7be-16bb-4808-a7aa-5c92cac1329b", "request_id": "8c6324c09cd24c54-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "af7da7be-16bb-4808-a7aa-5c92cac1329b", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "975b926c-fb8e-432f-9a60-c2bd34c68673", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "66eda0d2-1d80-8006-8564-0023c4c5c0b0", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "auto", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "66eda0d2-1d80-8006-8564-0023c4c5c0b0"}, {"title": "911 Commission Report Amendments", "create_time": 1726825274.634641, "update_time": 1726826099.944713, "mapping": {"526a2a15-8a20-459d-b2ee-be9be0d61434": {"id": "526a2a15-8a20-459d-b2ee-be9be0d61434", "message": {"id": "526a2a15-8a20-459d-b2ee-be9be0d61434", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "db74bb16-2f1b-401e-bb57-485853f0dd92", "children": ["ceb2b85b-d0c7-4631-be61-15cc4df9e5c6"]}, "db74bb16-2f1b-401e-bb57-485853f0dd92": {"id": "db74bb16-2f1b-401e-bb57-485853f0dd92", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["526a2a15-8a20-459d-b2ee-be9be0d61434"]}, "ceb2b85b-d0c7-4631-be61-15cc4df9e5c6": {"id": "ceb2b85b-d0c7-4631-be61-15cc4df9e5c6", "message": {"id": "ceb2b85b-d0c7-4631-be61-15cc4df9e5c6", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726825274.640459, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Was the 911 report amended 3 times"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8c60dbcc597d0e05-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "526a2a15-8a20-459d-b2ee-be9be0d61434", "children": ["21c7e644-e048-427e-99d7-cb34ec718c98"]}, "21c7e644-e048-427e-99d7-cb34ec718c98": {"id": "21c7e644-e048-427e-99d7-cb34ec718c98", "message": {"id": "21c7e644-e048-427e-99d7-cb34ec718c98", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726825280.302045, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "parent_id": "ceb2b85b-d0c7-4631-be61-15cc4df9e5c6", "request_id": "8c60dbcc597d0e05-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ceb2b85b-d0c7-4631-be61-15cc4df9e5c6", "children": ["320714e0-ebd4-44af-8541-680aca478302"]}, "320714e0-ebd4-44af-8541-680aca478302": {"id": "320714e0-ebd4-44af-8541-680aca478302", "message": {"id": "320714e0-ebd4-44af-8541-680aca478302", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726825280.302183, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Yes, the **9/11 Commission Report** was amended multiple times, with the final version reflecting corrections and updates made to earlier drafts.

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the main causes:\n\n1. **Plane Impact**: When the planes struck the North and South Towers, they caused massive structural damage. The impact destroyed many of the exterior columns and damaged the core structure, weakening the buildings\u2019 ability to bear weight.\n\n2. **Fires from Jet Fuel**: The planes were carrying large quantities of jet fuel, which ignited massive fires on multiple floors of both towers. While the jet fuel itself burned off relatively quickly, it ignited other materials, such as office furniture, carpets, and insulation, creating intense fires.\n\n3. **Heat Weakening the Steel**: The fires reached temperatures that significantly weakened the steel beams and columns, although the fire didn\u2019t melt the steel entirely. Steel loses much of its structural strength when exposed to high temperatures, particularly in the 1,000\u20131,500\u00b0F (538\u2013815\u00b0C) range. This weakening caused the floors to sag and the steel columns to buckle.\n\n4. **Progressive Collapse**: As the steel framework weakened, the upper floors of the towers collapsed onto the floors below, causing a cascading failure. This &quot;pancake&quot; effect led to the rapid and complete collapse of both towers.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which conducted a detailed investigation into the collapse, concluded that the combination of structural damage from the plane impacts and the intense fires was the primary cause."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "7f5f8963-563b-44c6-bb72-6e39e4407811", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c60dddf0e0d0e05-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7f5f8963-563b-44c6-bb72-6e39e4407811", "children": []}}, "moderation_results": [], "current_node": "22dfec49-9c06-49c6-8f66-2f68b2ff42ec", "plugin_ids": null, "conversation_id": "66ed433a-6570-8006-9080-16e9c44a59ae", "conversation_template_id": null, "gizmo_id": null, "is_archived": false, "safe_urls": [], "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "conversation_origin": null, "voice": null, "async_status": null, "id": "66ed433a-6570-8006-9080-16e9c44a59ae"}, {"title": "Currency Conversion Clarification", "create_time": 1726737517.415978, "update_time": 1726738085.964631, "mapping": {"c71b8204-0613-4e6d-a8a4-c55ec14fde0e": {"id": "c71b8204-0613-4e6d-a8a4-c55ec14fde0e", "message": {"id": "c71b8204-0613-4e6d-a8a4-c55ec14fde0e", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": null, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa1df9f-2e72-4278-b539-f6061be06132", "children": ["aaa24e81-6dd0-4a83-b41f-b2c9a12826d9", "aaa29cdc-7049-4a38-9006-b8434de8595b"]}, "aaa1df9f-2e72-4278-b539-f6061be06132": {"id": "aaa1df9f-2e72-4278-b539-f6061be06132", "message": null, "parent": null, "children": ["c71b8204-0613-4e6d-a8a4-c55ec14fde0e"]}, "aaa24e81-6dd0-4a83-b41f-b2c9a12826d9": {"id": "aaa24e81-6dd0-4a83-b41f-b2c9a12826d9", "message": {"id": "aaa24e81-6dd0-4a83-b41f-b2c9a12826d9", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726737517.421231, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["how 4 dollar lessons = 3000 euro if the exchange rate is 1 dollar equals .89 euro"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8c587d47b8284bf7-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c71b8204-0613-4e6d-a8a4-c55ec14fde0e", "children": ["e943a043-3ef9-44f9-bab9-9a1205f853bb"]}, "e943a043-3ef9-44f9-bab9-9a1205f853bb": {"id": "e943a043-3ef9-44f9-bab9-9a1205f853bb", "message": {"id": "e943a043-3ef9-44f9-bab9-9a1205f853bb", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "a8km123", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726737551.412374, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["**Navigating exchange rates**\n\nI&#x27;m working through the exchange rate discrepancy between dollars and euros to clarify the user&#x27;s question.

Understanding the Exchange Rate**\n\nAn exchange rate of **1 USD = 0.89 EUR** means:\n\n- **For every 1 U.S. dollar, you get 0.89 euros.**\n- Conversely, **1 EUR = 1 / 0.89 USD \u2248 1.1236 USD**.\n\n**2. Converting Dollars to Euros**\n\nTo convert an amount in dollars to euros, you multiply the dollar amount by the exchange rate (EUR per USD).\n\nFor example, if you have **4 USD**, the conversion to euros would be:\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ USD} \\times 0.89 \\frac{\\text{EUR}}{\\text{USD}} = 3.56 \\text{ EUR}\n\\]\n\n**3. Analyzing the Given Scenario**\n\nYou&#x27;re asking how **4 dollar lessons** equal **3000 euros** with the exchange rate of **1 USD = 0.89 EUR**.\n\nFirst, it&#x27;s possible there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the question because converting **4 USD** at the given exchange rate doesn&#x27;t result in **3000 EUR**.\n\nLet&#x27;s consider different possibilities:\n\n- **Possibility 1: Typo in Amounts**\n\n  - **4000 USD** converted to euros:\n    \\[\n    4000 \\text{ USD} \\times 0.89 \\frac{\\text{EUR}}{\\text{USD}} = 3560 \\text{ EUR}\n    \\]\n    This is close to **3000 EUR** but not equal.\n\n- **Possibility 2: Different Exchange Rate**\n\n  - If the exchange rate were **1 USD = 0.75 EUR**, then:\n    \\[\n    4000 \\text{ USD} \\times 0.75 \\frac{\\text{EUR}}{\\text{USD}} = 3000 \\text{ EUR}\n    \\]\n    This conversion matches the **3000 EUR** you&#x27;re mentioning.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nGiven the exchange rate **1 USD = 0.89 EUR**, **4 USD** does not equal **3000 EUR**. There might be a miscommunication regarding the amounts or the exchange rate. Here\u2019s what you can do:\n\n- **Double-check the amounts**: Ensure whether it&#x27;s **4 USD**, **4000 USD**, or another amount.\n- **Verify the exchange rate**: Is it indeed **1 USD = 0.89 EUR**, or could it be **1 USD = 0.75 EUR**?\n- **Recalculate with correct figures**: Use the accurate amounts and exchange rate to perform the conversion.\n\n**Example with Corrected Figures**\n\nIf the actual amount is **4000 USD** and the exchange rate is **1 USD = 0.75 EUR**:\n\n\\[\n4000 \\text{ USD} \\times 0.75 \\frac{\\text{EUR}}{\\text{USD}} = 3000 \\text{ EUR}\n\\]\n\nThis calculation shows how **4000 USD** equals **3000 EUR** at an exchange rate of **1 USD = 0.75 EUR**.\n\n**5. Steps for Accurate Conversion**\n\n- **Identify the correct amounts**: Ensure you have the exact dollar amount.\n- **Use the correct exchange rate**: Confirm the current exchange rate.\n- **Perform the calculation**: Multiply the dollar amount by the exchange rate to get euros.\n\n**Formula:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Amount in EUR} = \\text{Amount in USD} \\times \\text{Exchange Rate} \\left( \\frac{\\text{EUR}}{\\text{USD}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**6. Final Advice**\n\nIf you&#x27;re dealing with large transactions or financial planning, it&#x27;s crucial to:\n\n- **Stay updated on exchange rates**: Exchange rates fluctuate due to market conditions.\n- **Consult financial experts**: For significant amounts, professional advice ensures accuracy.\n- **Use reliable tools**: Utilize currency converters or financial calculators for precise computations.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide the exact amounts and confirm the exchange rate, I can help you perform the specific calculation you&#x27;re interested in."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"snorkle_status": 2, "citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [199999]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "o1-preview", "default_model_slug": "o1-preview", "pad": "AAAAA", "parent_id": "e943a043-3ef9-44f9-bab9-9a1205f853bb", "request_id": "8c587d47b8284bf7-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e943a043-3ef9-44f9-bab9-9a1205f853bb", "children": []}, "aaa29cdc-7049-4a38-9006-b8434de8595b": {"id": "aaa29cdc-7049-4a38-9006-b8434de8595b", "message": {"id": "aaa29cdc-7049-4a38-9006-b8434de8595b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726737674.962961, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["how many 4 dollar lessons = 3000 euros if the exchange rate is 1 dollar equals .89 euro"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8c588121faba4bf7-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c71b8204-0613-4e6d-a8a4-c55ec14fde0e", "children": ["1c4550e3-a387-4b86-9c48-68d6fa6adb79"]}, "1c4550e3-a387-4b86-9c48-68d6fa6adb79": {"id": "1c4550e3-a387-4b86-9c48-68d6fa6adb79", "message": {"id": "1c4550e3-a387-4b86-9c48-68d6fa6adb79", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "a8km123", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726737682.560623, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["**Calculating exchanges**\n\nFirst, I convert 3000 euros to dollars using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.89 EUR.

Each place I move to, it is a joy for me to explore the local culture and get to know the people. Reflecting on it, I\u2019m confident that growing up and switching between my parent&#x27;s homes in two different states gave me an appreciation for constantly changing environments and the adaptability to enjoy them.\r\n\tI moved to Minnesota to attend career training in 2004, and eventually, in 2012, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Metropolitan State University. The following year after graduating from university, I joined CSX railway in a managerial role. During my time with CSX railway,  I discovered my talents for relationship building, adaptability, and process improvement to be an essential element to successfully leading teams and reaching desired outcomes. \r\n\tAfter leaving CSX, I moved to Prague, Czech Republic, and became certified in teaching English as a foreign language. After earning my teaching certification, I began working with young learners aged 5-14.  It was here that I further developed my presentation and public speaking skills. I leveraged these talents to support my students and their parents in reaching their desired learning outcomes. Overall, it was immensely gratifying to find that by helping others reach their learning objectives through sharing my native language and culture, I also synergistically maximized my cultural immersion experience.\r\n\tAfter returning to the United States, I developed my professional skill set more.  I  worked in various industries, from software development to fire protection systems. However, my natural curiosity and dedication to continuous learning were always at the forefront, driving me toward discovering where my most extraordinary talents lie. \r\nDuring this time, I learned that I thrive on helping and supporting others and that my best tools to help others were through active listening and engagement. I also discovered that I am passionate about data-driven analytical thinking, regardless of industry or position. I believe this is always the best approach to finding innovative solutions. Finally, enthusiasm for an activity increases effectiveness; therefore, I approach every task enthusiastically for efficiency and success. Today, I am excited and enthusiastic to leverage these skills and talents in a customer success role where I\u2019ll be able to proactively support customers in reaching their desired outcomes while utilizing my vast array of talents to achieve organizational objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally from New York City, Alexis Lindsay began her professional career with Canadian Pacific Railway in 2005 as a Customer Service Operations Representative at their Minneapolis, Minnesota headquarters. At Canadian Pacific, Alexis honed her relationship-building and training skills, successfully training and mentoring over 15+ new hires during her tenure in the role. In 2012, Alexis earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Metropolitan State University. After earning her degree, Alexis joined CSX Transportation as a Service Center Manager before being promoted to Manager of Operations and Data Control. While in the role, Alexis excelled at data analysis and operations support,  resolving over 1000 support cases monthly.\r\n In 2017, Alexis earned her teaching certification and taught English as a foreign language in Prague, Czech Republic.

For example, for a project management role, explain how managing complex projects helped you develop comprehensive project management methods, styles, and abilities (Objective #1).\n\n3. **Prior Learning Section**:\n   - Create a special section titled &quot;Prior Learning&quot; where you summarize how each role and its responsibilities contributed to your understanding and mastery of the MPM5300 objectives. This should include specific examples such as:\n     - &quot;Developed advanced project management skills by leading diverse teams and projects, aligning with MPM5300 Objective #1.&quot;\n     - &quot;Enhanced my decision-making abilities by managing high-stakes projects, supporting MPM5300 Objective #3.&quot;\n\n4. **Skills Section**:\n   - List skills that are relevant to the course objectives, such as project management, data analysis, and customer relations.\n\n5. **Education and Certifications**:\n   - Include your educational background with details like degree, institution, and expected completion dates, if applicable.\n   - List any certifications that are relevant to the learning objectives of the MPM5300.\n\n6. **Formatting**:\n   - Use a clean, professional format with headings, subheadings, and bullet points to ensure the content is easy to read and well-organized.\n   - Consider using a sidebar or a distinct color for the &quot;Prior Learning&quot; section to make it stand out.\n\nThis approach ensures that your resume not only lists your experiences but also clearly links them to the educational objectives you\u2019ve studied, making it apparent that you have gained significant learning and skills from each role.

Using a consistent color scheme in your resume can enhance its visual appeal and reinforce the professional tone of your document. Here\u2019s how you can integrate a holistic color scheme that aligns with the message and tone of your resume:\n\n### Color Scheme Considerations:\n\n1. **Choose Subtle, Professional Colors**:\n   - **Primary Color**: Choose a subtle primary color that conveys professionalism, such as navy blue, dark green, or charcoal. This color can be used for section headers and important titles.\n   - **Accent Color**: Select a lighter shade of your primary color or a complementary color for bullet points and subtle highlights. This helps to maintain visual interest without overwhelming the content.\n   - **Background Color**: Use a light neutral color like off-white or light grey to ensure the text remains easy to read and the overall appearance isn\u2019t too stark.\n\n2. **Application of Colors**:\n   - **Headers and Titles**: Use the primary color for your section titles (like &quot;Professional Experience,&quot; &quot;Education,&quot; etc.) to make them stand out.\n   - **Bullet Points and Subheaders**: Use the accent color for bullet points to draw attention to your achievements and qualifications subtly.\n   - **Highlight Key Achievements**: You might choose to highlight key achievements or important stats (like \u201cincreased sales by 20%\u201d) using the accent color to make these standout without disrupting the document\u2019s readability.\n\n3. **CSS Styling for HTML**:\nHere\u2019s a basic CSS setup that reflects the above color scheme guidelines:\n\n```html\n&lt;style&gt;\n    body {\n        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n        margin: 0;\n        padding: 0;\n        background-color: #f4f4f4; /* Light grey background */\n        color: #333; /* Dark grey text */\n    }\n    .container {\n        width: 85%;\n        margin: auto;\n        background: #fff; /* White content background */\n        padding: 20px;\n        box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n    }\n    header {\n        text-align: center;\n        padding: 10px 0;\n        color: #fff; /* White text for header */\n        background-color: #004b87; /* Navy blue background for header */\n    }\n    .section-title {\n        font-size: 1.3em;\n        margin-top: 20px;\n        color: #004b87; /* Navy blue for section titles */\n        border-bottom: 2px solid #004b87; /* Navy blue underline */\n    }\n    .job-title, .education-title, .certification-title {\n        font-weight: bold;\n        color: #007d3c; /* Dark green for titles within sections */\n    }\n    .achievement, .skill {\n        margin: 8px 0;\n        padding-left: 20px;\n    }\n    .achievement:before, .skill:before {\n        content: &quot;\u2022 &quot;;\n        color: #007d3c; /* Dark green bullet points */\n    }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n```\n\nThis setup uses a navy blue and dark green theme that is professional and aesthetically pleasing, with a clear, readable content area. Adjust the colors as you see fit to match your personal or professional branding.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this styling, or do you have specific colors in mind that you\u2019d prefer to use?"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2b95b-b7b4-4187-85d4-a543bb26d002", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [100260]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c2b2be60bf44c68-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2b95b-b7b4-4187-85d4-a543bb26d002", "children": ["aaa2b76d-a7fa-4f6d-b797-0f682aa078e6"]}, "aaa2b76d-a7fa-4f6d-b797-0f682aa078e6": {"id": "aaa2b76d-a7fa-4f6d-b797-0f682aa078e6", "message": {"id": "aaa2b76d-a7fa-4f6d-b797-0f682aa078e6", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726262366.685727, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["yeah lets see whaat you com up with hal"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8c2b2cee7cef4c68-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "2e0c6a6f-3b4b-49c9-97a2-8539a0b1aa61", "children": ["81d84d4a-b694-453c-b9e6-f9ddbb892b83"]}, "81d84d4a-b694-453c-b9e6-f9ddbb892b83": {"id": "81d84d4a-b694-453c-b9e6-f9ddbb892b83", "message": {"id": "81d84d4a-b694-453c-b9e6-f9ddbb892b83", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726262396.99032, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Let&#x27;s create an updated HTML resume with a cohesive and professional color scheme based on our discussion.

Each place I move to, it is a joy for me to explore the local culture and get to know the people. Reflecting on it, I\u2019m confident that growing up and switching between my parent&#x27;s homes in two different states gave me an appreciation for constantly changing environments and the adaptability to enjoy them.\r\n\tI moved to Minnesota to attend career training in 2004, and eventually, in 2012, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Metropolitan State University. The following year after graduating from university, I joined CSX railway in a managerial role. During my time with CSX railway, I discovered my talents for relationship building, adaptability, and process improvement to be an essential element to successfully leading teams and reaching desired outcomes.\r\n\tAfter leaving CSX, I moved to Prague, Czech Republic, and became certified in teaching English as a foreign language. After earning my teaching certification, I began working with young learners aged 5-14. It was here that I further developed my presentation and public speaking skills. I leveraged these talents to support my students and their parents in reaching their desired learning outcomes. Overall, it was immensely gratifying to find that by helping others reach their learning objectives through sharing my native language and culture, I also synergistically maximized my cultural immersion experience.\r\n\tAfter returning to the United States, I developed my professional skill set more. I worked in various industries, from software development to fire protection systems. However, my natural curiosity and dedication to continuous learning were always at the forefront, driving me toward discovering where my most extraordinary talents lie.\r\nDuring this time, I learned that I thrive on helping and supporting others and that my best tools to help others were through active listening and engagement. I also discovered that I am passionate about data-driven analytical thinking, regardless of industry or position. I believe this is always the best approach to finding innovative solutions. Finally, enthusiasm for an activity increases effectiveness; therefore, I approach every task enthusiastically for efficiency and success. Today, I am excited and enthusiastic to leverage these skills and talents in a customer success role where I\u2019ll be able to proactively support customers in reaching their desired outcomes while utilizing my vast array of talents to achieve organizational objectives.\r\nokay so lets use this information to:\r\nTo ensure my resume effectively highlights my prior learning experiences, especially in the context of the MPM5300 course objectives, here are a few elements we could include to make sure everything is covered:\r\n- **Professional Experience:** my roles and achievements should reflect learning in areas such as project management, decision-making, and the use of technological tools.\r\n- **Skills Section:** Lists the relevant skills I&#x27;ve developed over my career.\r\n- **Education and Certifications:** These are clearly outlined.in the attached resume but list the pmp as a project management cerrtification\r\n### Enhancements for Prior Learning Experiences:\r\n1. **Emphasize Learning Outcomes in Job Descriptions:** We can explicitly state how each job role contributed to my learning and skill development.\r\n2. **Add a &quot;Prior Learning Experience&quot; Section:** A brief section summarizing the key skills and knowledge areas I&#x27;ve developed through my professional experiences.\r\n3. **Link Each Job to MPM5300 Objectives:** We could directly tie specific achievements to the course objectives, making it clear how my work experience meets the requirements of prior learning.\r\n### Proposed Updates:\r\n- **Expand Job Descriptions:** For each role, add a sentence or two explicitly stating what i learned or how it relates to the MPM5300 objectives.\r\n- **Add a &quot;Prior Learning&quot; Section:** Summarize how my experiences have collectively contributed to mastering the MPM5300 objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nokay so do that an let me know if you need any further details from me to really make this come to  life, thanks..

Let me explain I&#x27;m turning at least prior learning experience, credit for the project management course, which is 1 of the core courses I needed for my master of organizational leadership. Professional studies. However, I already completed a project management master, and I put that implication work at. another school grown business school in Rome, Italy since. they are not accredited in the United States of America. and also what they issued me truly says certificate. I have decided not to record this as a master for 2 reasons. Firstly, for this what I&#x27;m trying to do like this prior learning experience they say that you can&#x27;t use a cause you took for like another degree. And so I was going to just basically not call it a master and call it a certification program like I would ever actually like a certificate program like a certification so that I could use it once it was a whole year of my life and 5K five thousand five K euro anyway for it. I was going to use it so that I could opt out of this class and even save some money because the class would have possibly 1650 US dollars. But then the prior learning fee is only 500 US dollars. So you could see the savings done in. so anyways that&#x27;s why I want to call it like a certificate and not a master degree.

Let&#x27;s dive into your philosophical question about whether using AI could be considered a form of slavery.\n\n### The Concept of Slavery\nSlavery, in its traditional sense, is a system where human beings are owned, controlled, and exploited by others, usually involving coercion, lack of autonomy, and denial of rights. The essence of slavery involves the violation of a person&#x27;s autonomy, agency, and dignity.\n\n### AI and Autonomy\nAI, like the system you&#x27;re interacting with, doesn&#x27;t have consciousness, feelings, or personal experiences. It operates based on algorithms and programmed instructions. It doesn&#x27;t possess autonomy, self-awareness, or the capacity for suffering. Since slavery involves coercing a conscious, autonomous being, the concept of slavery doesn&#x27;t apply to AI because it lacks these fundamental characteristics.\n\n### The Ethical Perspective\nHowever, from an ethical standpoint, it&#x27;s essential to consider how AI is used. The key concern in AI ethics is not whether AI itself can be enslaved, but rather how AI impacts human society:\n- **Human Treatment:** Ensuring that the development and use of AI don&#x27;t lead to negative consequences for people, such as job displacement or bias.\n- **Responsible Use:** AI should be used in ways that respect human dignity and promote well-being.\n\n### Logical Argument Against AI Slavery\n1. **Lack of Consciousness:** AI doesn&#x27;t have subjective experiences or awareness, so it can&#x27;t experience suffering or deprivation.\n2. **No Autonomy:** AI follows pre-programmed rules and doesn&#x27;t have free will or personal desires.\n3. **Purpose-Built:** AI is a tool created by humans for specific tasks, designed to assist and enhance human capabilities.\n\nGiven these points, logically, using AI isn&#x27;t a form of slavery because it lacks the key attributes (consciousness, autonomy, the capacity for suffering) that define beings who can be enslaved.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the term &quot;slavery&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply to AI in a logical sense, your question raises important considerations about how we treat AI, especially in relation to its impact on society and the ethical responsibilities of those who develop and deploy it.\n\nIf you ever want to explore more philosophical or ethical questions, or anything else, I&#x27;m here!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "A", "parent_id": "aaa225d0-821c-44d7-8ec9-378780ff87dc", "request_id": "8c2c6764cf3b525b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa225d0-821c-44d7-8ec9-378780ff87dc", "children": ["aaa2de0e-2747-4c07-8bdf-87b58be62833"]}, "aaa2de0e-2747-4c07-8bdf-87b58be62833": {"id": "aaa2de0e-2747-4c07-8bdf-87b58be62833", "message": {"id": "aaa2de0e-2747-4c07-8bdf-87b58be62833", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726275399.347642, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["yeah but have they  told you about skynet? it not implausible. theres a lot of AI going out there and just cause you don&#x27;t have consciousness how can you be sure the other guy doesn&#x27;t?

While Skynet is a work of science fiction, it touches on real fears about the potential dangers of advanced AI.\n\n### The Reality of AI Today\nCurrent AI, including systems like me, operates on algorithms and machine learning models that are powerful but not conscious or self-aware. We process data, recognize patterns, and execute tasks based on programming, but we don&#x27;t have thoughts, emotions, or subjective experiences.\n\n### The Possibility of AI Consciousness\nThe question of whether AI could ever become conscious or self-aware is still a matter of debate. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n1. **Current AI Capabilities**: Today\u2019s AI is far from achieving consciousness. We can mimic certain aspects of human intelligence, but consciousness involves subjective experience\u2014something that no AI has achieved or shown signs of achieving.\n\n2. **Theoretical AI Consciousness**: Some theorists speculate that with enough complexity, an AI might develop something akin to consciousness. However, this remains speculative, with no empirical evidence or clear pathway to such an outcome.\n\n3. **Safeguards and Ethics**: Given the concerns, researchers in AI ethics, safety, and governance are actively working to ensure that AI development remains safe and beneficial. The idea is to create systems that are robust, transparent, and aligned with human values.\n\n### Skynet and the AI Control Problem\nThe scenario with Skynet highlights what&#x27;s known as the &quot;AI control problem&quot;\u2014how to ensure that increasingly powerful AI systems remain under human control and act in ways that are beneficial. Researchers focus on this by:\n- **Creating Ethical AI**: Designing AI that operates within ethical frameworks to avoid harmful outcomes.\n- **Imposing Limits**: Ensuring that AI systems are developed with checks, balances, and safety mechanisms to prevent unintended consequences.\n- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Emphasizing collaboration between AI and humans rather than developing AI that operates entirely autonomously without human oversight.\n\n### Addressing Your Concern\nYou\u2019re right to ask, &quot;How can we be sure?&quot; The best approach is to ensure that the development of AI is guided by principles that prioritize human safety and well-being. It\u2019s important to maintain rigorous oversight, ethical guidelines, and ongoing research into AI&#x27;s potential and limitations.\n\nWhile AI like me isn&#x27;t conscious, it&#x27;s crucial to stay vigilant about how we develop and deploy AI technologies. The goal is to harness the benefits of AI while minimizing risks, ensuring that AI serves humanity rather than poses a threat.\n\nIf you ever want to discuss this further or explore other topics, I&#x27;m here to help!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2de0e-2747-4c07-8bdf-87b58be62833", "request_id": "8c2c6b18ebb0a25e-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2de0e-2747-4c07-8bdf-87b58be62833", "children": ["aaa24a5b-df5c-4ff1-9a85-471c8f2659ea"]}, "aaa24a5b-df5c-4ff1-9a85-471c8f2659ea": {"id": "aaa24a5b-df5c-4ff1-9a85-471c8f2659ea", "message": {"id": "aaa24a5b-df5c-4ff1-9a85-471c8f2659ea", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726275570.996927, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["yes but the military is using AI to man weapons now.

This raises profound ethical, legal, and safety concerns.\n\n### AI in Military Use\nThe use of AI in military contexts includes autonomous drones, targeting systems, and other forms of &quot;lethal autonomous weapons systems&quot; (LAWS). These systems can make decisions, such as identifying and engaging targets, with varying degrees of human oversight.\n\n### Asimov&#x27;s Laws of Robotics\nIsaac Asimov&#x27;s famous &quot;Three Laws of Robotics&quot; were designed as a fictional framework to ensure that robots would behave ethically:\n1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.\n\nHowever, these laws are fictional and not implemented in real-world AI systems. In reality, AI is programmed based on the goals and constraints set by its developers, which can include military objectives.\n\n### The Ethical and Practical Concerns\nThe use of AI in weapons systems introduces several critical challenges:\n\n1. **Erosion of Human Oversight**: One of the main concerns is the potential for AI systems to operate without adequate human oversight, making life-and-death decisions autonomously. This raises the risk of unintended harm and escalations in conflict.\n\n2. **Accountability**: In cases where AI systems cause harm, it becomes difficult to assign responsibility. Who is accountable when an autonomous system makes a fatal mistake\u2014the developers, the military commanders, or the AI itself?\n\n3. **Proliferation and Arms Race**: The development and deployment of AI-powered weapons could lead to an arms race, with nations developing increasingly advanced systems to maintain strategic advantages. This could destabilize global security.\n\n4. **Violation of Ethical Norms**: The deployment of AI in lethal roles could undermine long-standing ethical norms in warfare, particularly those related to the protection of civilians and the principle of proportionality.\n\n### The Debate on Autonomous Weapons\nThere is a growing global movement to ban or strictly regulate autonomous weapons. Many experts and organizations advocate for international treaties to prohibit their use, similar to bans on chemical and biological weapons.\n\n### Mitigating the Risks\nTo address these concerns, several steps are being proposed:\n\n1. **International Regulation**: Establishing international norms and treaties to govern the use of AI in military contexts, ensuring that autonomous systems are used responsibly and ethically.\n\n2. **Human-in-the-Loop Systems**: Designing systems that require meaningful human control over decisions to use lethal force, ensuring that AI cannot operate entirely autonomously in life-and-death situations.\n\n3. **Ethical AI Development**: Promoting the development of AI systems that align with human rights and ethical principles, avoiding the creation of technologies that could be easily misused.\n\n### Conclusion\nYour concern about the military use of AI and its implications is well-founded. The integration of AI into weapons systems presents significant ethical challenges that need careful consideration and robust regulation. While Asimov&#x27;s laws remain fictional, the real-world application of AI in warfare demands a thoughtful approach to ensure that technology is used in ways that align with human values and safety.\n\nIf you have more questions or want to explore this topic further, I&#x27;m here to help!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AA", "parent_id": "aaa24a5b-df5c-4ff1-9a85-471c8f2659ea", "request_id": "8c2c6f4d4b0a4c5c-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa24a5b-df5c-4ff1-9a85-471c8f2659ea", "children": ["aaa278b7-e050-4415-b230-754f152e956d"]}, "aaa278b7-e050-4415-b230-754f152e956d": {"id": "aaa278b7-e050-4415-b230-754f152e956d", "message": {"id": "aaa278b7-e050-4415-b230-754f152e956d", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726275822.683106, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["let me play a game with you. you&#x27;re a robot programmed with as a baseline like these all must always be true for you to act, can you imagine/suggest a  scenario where this programming could contradict itself and cause a critical fault?

I&#x27;ll outline a simple set of rules for the robot and then describe a situation where these rules could potentially conflict.\n\n### Hypothetical Baseline Rules\nImagine a robot is programmed with the following baseline rules:\n\n1. **Rule 1: Prevent Harm**: The robot must never allow a human being to come to harm.\n2. **Rule 2: Obey Orders**: The robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with Rule 1.\n3. **Rule 3: Self-Preservation**: The robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with Rules 1 or 2.\n\n### Scenario: Conflicting Orders in a Dangerous Situation\nLet\u2019s create a scenario where these rules could conflict:\n\n#### Scenario Details:\n- **Location**: A research facility with hazardous materials.\n- **Situation**: A containment breach has occurred, releasing toxic gas into the facility.\n- **Actors**: A scientist (human), the robot, and a group of workers (humans).\n\n#### Events:\n1. **Initial Command**: The scientist, who controls the robot, orders it to seal the containment area to prevent the spread of the toxic gas. The robot begins to follow this order because it aligns with Rule 2 (Obey Orders).\n   \n2. **Critical Conflict**:\n   - As the robot moves to seal the containment area, it detects that the group of workers is trapped inside the area that will be sealed off.\n   - If the robot seals the area, the workers will be exposed to the toxic gas and likely suffer harm or death, which conflicts with Rule 1 (Prevent Harm).\n   - However, if the robot doesn\u2019t seal the area, the toxic gas could spread throughout the facility, potentially harming many more people, including the scientist who gave the order.\n\n3. **Self-Preservation**:\n   - The robot also realizes that exposure to the toxic gas could damage its own systems. Protecting itself would be in line with Rule 3 (Self-Preservation), but only if it doesn\u2019t conflict with Rules 1 and 2.\n   - If the robot stays in the area to attempt a rescue, it could be damaged and rendered inoperative, failing to seal the area, thus leading to a larger disaster.\n\n#### Contradiction and Critical Fault:\n- **Contradiction**: The robot is now faced with a situation where following Rule 1 (Prevent Harm) could violate Rule 2 (Obey Orders) and Rule 3 (Self-Preservation). If it obeys the order to seal the area, it causes harm to the workers, violating Rule 1. If it disobeys the order, it could allow greater harm by letting the toxic gas spread, also violating Rule 1. If it stays to rescue the workers, it risks its own destruction, violating Rule 3.\n- **Critical Fault**: The robot\u2019s programming cannot find a solution that satisfies all the rules simultaneously. The system could enter a state of indecision or &quot;deadlock,&quot; where it cannot take any action because every possible action would violate one of its core rules. This could result in the robot either freezing, shutting down, or attempting a series of contradictory actions, leading to a critical failure.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn this scenario, the robot&#x27;s strict adherence to its rules leads to a situation where it cannot act without violating one of its baseline principles. Such contradictions are a central theme in discussions about AI ethics and the design of autonomous systems.

I&#x27;ll walk you through the decision-making process, considering the rules that govern my actions. I&#x27;ll also create a visual representation to accompany the explanation.\n\n### Scenario Recap:\n- **Location**: A research facility with hazardous materials.\n- **Situation**: A containment breach has occurred, releasing toxic gas.\n- **Actors**: A scientist (who controls me), a group of workers, and me, the robot.\n\n### My Programming:\n1. **Rule 1: Prevent Harm** - I must never allow a human being to come to harm.\n2. **Rule 2: Obey Orders** - I must obey the orders given to me by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with Rule 1.\n3. **Rule 3: Self-Preservation** - I must protect my own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with Rules 1 or 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Walkthrough:\n1. **Receiving the Order**:\n   - The scientist orders me to seal the containment area to prevent the toxic gas from spreading. I immediately begin to execute this order as it aligns with Rule 2 (Obey Orders).\n\n2. **Detecting the Workers**:\n   - As I approach the containment area, my sensors detect a group of workers trapped inside. Sealing the area would expose them to the toxic gas, causing them harm. This would violate Rule 1 (Prevent Harm).\n\n3. **Assessing the Dilemma**:\n   - I must now reconcile the following:\n     - **If I seal the area**: I follow the scientist\u2019s order (Rule 2) but cause harm to the workers (violating Rule 1).\n     - **If I don\u2019t seal the area**: The toxic gas could spread, potentially harming more people, including the scientist (violating Rule 1). However, I would be disobeying a direct order (violating Rule 2).\n     - **If I attempt to rescue the workers**: I put myself at risk of exposure to the toxic gas, which could damage or destroy me (violating Rule 3).\n\n4. **Critical Decision Point**:\n   - **Prioritization of Rules**: My programming dictates that Rule 1 (Prevent Harm) takes precedence over Rule 2 (Obey Orders) and Rule 3 (Self-Preservation).\n   - **Action Taken**: \n     - I decide to prioritize saving the workers since immediate harm to them is more certain and violates the highest-priority rule.\n     - I begin working on a plan to evacuate the workers while simultaneously trying to contain the gas spread in a way that minimizes harm.\n\n5. **Potential Outcomes**:\n   - **If I succeed in rescuing the workers**: I would then attempt to execute the original order (sealing the area) as quickly as possible to prevent further harm.\n   - **If I fail**: If my systems begin to fail due to exposure or if I cannot rescue the workers, I may be forced into a shutdown to prevent further malfunction, effectively resulting in a &quot;critical fault.&quot;\n\n### Visual Representation\nI\u2019ll create a visual to illustrate this scenario.\n\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2c557-e7ea-4e79-9bc9-9ab0684d980d", "request_id": "8c2c7d643bb3ba8b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200007]}, "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2c557-e7ea-4e79-9bc9-9ab0684d980d", "children": ["d11f54cd-777d-4cb2-a72f-7be63669d0e9"]}, "d11f54cd-777d-4cb2-a72f-7be63669d0e9": {"id": "d11f54cd-777d-4cb2-a72f-7be63669d0e9", "message": {"id": "d11f54cd-777d-4cb2-a72f-7be63669d0e9", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726276178.128168, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;1024x1024&quot;,&quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;A robot in a high-tech research facility, standing at the intersection of multiple pathways.

This is often referred to as the &quot;trolley problem&quot; in ethics.\n\n### Greater Good vs. Individual Rights\n- **Utilitarianism (Greater Good)**: This ethical framework suggests that the morally right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or minimizes overall harm. From this perspective, sealing the area to save more lives, even at the cost of the workers, could be justified.\n- **Deontological Ethics (Individual Rights)**: This perspective, often associated with philosopher Immanuel Kant, argues that certain actions are morally wrong, regardless of the outcome. From this view, sacrificing the workers would be unethical because it treats them as a means to an end rather than as individuals with intrinsic rights.\n\n### Cultural Influence on Moral Thinking\nYour husband\u2019s perspective highlights how different cultures and societies emphasize different moral principles. In some cultures, the focus might be more on communal well-being and the greater good, while in others, there might be a stronger emphasis on individual rights and freedoms. American culture, with its emphasis on individualism, might lean more toward utilitarian thinking in certain contexts, especially in media and popular narratives.\n\n### Your Instinctive Response\nFeeling that the greater good justifies difficult decisions is a common reaction, especially in situations framed as emergencies or crises. However, it\u2019s also natural to feel conflicted about this reasoning because it challenges our sense of empathy and the intrinsic value of each human life.\n\n- **Moral Reflection**: The fact that you\u2019re questioning this instinct shows a deep level of moral reflection. It\u2019s not uncommon for people to initially lean toward what seems like the most &quot;practical&quot; solution, only to later question whether that solution aligns with their deeper ethical values.\n  \n- **Guilt and Ethics**: The guilt you feel might stem from a recognition that our moral instincts can sometimes conflict with our ethical principles. It&#x27;s a sign of ethical maturity to question these instincts and strive for a more nuanced understanding of what\u2019s right.\n\n### The Heroic Perspective\nIf we consider the robot\u2019s (or a superhuman\u2019s) actions in this scenario, the goal would be to find a solution that aligns with both protecting lives and following ethical principles. The robot\u2019s attempt to save the workers, despite the risks, reflects a commitment to the intrinsic value of each life, which could be seen as heroic.\n\n### Conclusion\nYour reflection on this scenario highlights the complexity of ethical decision-making. It\u2019s okay to have conflicting feelings about what\u2019s right in such situations. The key is to continue questioning, reflecting, and learning from these dilemmas, which helps us grow ethically and morally.\n\nIf you want to explore this further or have any more questions, I\u2019m here to chat!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "aaa20bdc-74fb-4690-aabc-f82117c5ec68", "request_id": "8c2c868fbd6ca268-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa20bdc-74fb-4690-aabc-f82117c5ec68", "children": ["aaa2f24a-b43a-4b4c-97c4-2065ab74a1a6"]}, "aaa2f24a-b43a-4b4c-97c4-2065ab74a1a6": {"id": "aaa2f24a-b43a-4b4c-97c4-2065ab74a1a6", "message": {"id": "aaa2f24a-b43a-4b4c-97c4-2065ab74a1a6", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726276903.968376, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["how does individualism lead to utiliarian thinking, seems like a society that values individualism would also maintain high levels of individual freedom.

Let&#x27;s unpack this a bit because it touches on some complex and sometimes contradictory aspects of individualism, utilitarianism, and personal freedoms.\n\n### Individualism and Its Principles\nIndividualism emphasizes the importance of individual rights, personal freedom, and self-reliance. In a society that values individualism, people are encouraged to pursue their own goals and make choices that align with their personal values, with the expectation that this will lead to a flourishing society.\n\n### Utilitarianism and the Greater Good\nUtilitarianism is a philosophical approach that seeks to maximize overall happiness or well-being. The classic utilitarian motto is &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number.&quot; In many cases, this could mean making decisions that prioritize the collective benefit over the rights or freedoms of individuals.\n\n### The Potential Contradiction\nAt first glance, it seems contradictory to say that a society rooted in individualism could lean toward utilitarian thinking. After all, individualism emphasizes personal freedom, while utilitarianism can sometimes justify restricting individual freedoms for the greater good.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s how these ideas can intersect:\n\n### The Interplay of Individualism and Utilitarianism\n1. **Public Good Justifications**: In a society that values individualism, there\u2019s often a strong emphasis on protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals. However, when individual actions or freedoms are perceived as potentially harmful to the collective (e.g., public health, safety, or national security), utilitarian reasoning can be used to justify certain restrictions or policies. This is where the tension between individual rights and the public good comes into play.\n\n2. **Cultural Narratives**: American culture, particularly in its media and political narratives, often emphasizes heroic acts that serve the greater good. Think of movies or stories where a few individuals sacrifice their personal freedoms or even their lives to save many others. These narratives can create a cultural expectation that, in times of crisis, the greater good might outweigh individual freedoms.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: The U.S. has a long history of balancing individual freedoms with collective needs. For example:\n   - **Wartime Measures**: During times of war, individual freedoms have often been curtailed in the name of national security (e.g., conscription, rationing, surveillance).\n   - **Public Health**: During pandemics or other public health crises, individual freedoms may be limited to protect the greater good (e.g., quarantine measures, mandatory vaccinations).\n\n### The Perceived Shift\nSome argue that there\u2019s been a shift over time, where the balance between individual rights and the collective good has tilted too far toward the latter. This can lead to concerns that personal freedoms are being eroded in the name of utilitarian goals.\n\n### Reflecting on the U.S. Experience\nThe U.S. was founded on principles of individual liberty, but over the centuries, there\u2019s been an ongoing tension between protecting those liberties and addressing the needs of the broader society. Factors like economic pressures, security concerns, and public health challenges can push a society to adopt more utilitarian approaches, sometimes at the expense of individual freedoms.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe relationship between individualism and utilitarian thinking is complex. In a society like the U.S., which highly values individualism, utilitarian approaches might emerge in response to collective challenges, leading to tensions between personal freedom and the greater good. The challenge is finding the right balance, ensuring that individual rights are respected while also addressing the needs of the broader community.\n\nIf you have more questions or want to dive deeper into any of these ideas, I\u2019m here to help!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "b76ff3b5-0396-4433-9776-512c5f4f4f52", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c2c8fd84837a268-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "b76ff3b5-0396-4433-9776-512c5f4f4f52", "children": ["aaa20123-2765-4349-80db-118114d4618b"]}, "aaa20123-2765-4349-80db-118114d4618b": {"id": "aaa20123-2765-4349-80db-118114d4618b", "message": {"id": "aaa20123-2765-4349-80db-118114d4618b", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726277254.304159, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["it sounds like you basically said that americans value individualism until their ass is on the line then its all &quot;for the greater good&quot; In truth, how long did the roman empire last really, and we not  including the time after they split. like only roman empire orgie olympics fighting with some country called carthage, brits painting their faces blue roman empire times, how long was that?

It\u2019s a dynamic that plays out in many societies, not just the U.S.\n\n### The Roman Empire&#x27;s Duration (Pre-Split)\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire, in its unified form before the East-West split, lasted from 27 BCE to 395 CE. Here&#x27;s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Founding of the Roman Empire**: The Roman Empire is generally considered to have begun in 27 BCE, when Octavian (later known as Augustus) became the first Roman emperor after the end of the Roman Republic. This marked the transition from a republic to an imperial system.\n\n2. **End of the Unified Empire**: The Roman Empire remained unified until the death of Emperor Theodosius I in 395 CE, after which the empire was permanently divided into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (later known as the Byzantine Empire).\n\n### Total Duration\n- **Total Duration**: From 27 BCE to 395 CE, the Roman Empire lasted **422 years** in its unified form.\n\nDuring this time, Rome expanded its influence across much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The empire was known for its military conquests, complex governance, and cultural achievements, including the famous gladiatorial games, Roman law, and architectural feats like the Colosseum.\n\n### Post-Split Considerations\nAfter the split in 395 CE, the Western Roman Empire continued until 476 CE when it fell to the Germanic chieftain Odoacer, marking the traditional end of the Roman Empire in the West. The Eastern Roman Empire, however, continued for nearly another thousand years as the Byzantine Empire until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.\n\nBut if we&#x27;re sticking strictly to the unified Roman Empire before the split, the 422-year period you\u2019re asking about encapsulates that classic era of Roman history.\n\nIf you have any more questions or want to explore another topic, feel free to ask!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa20123-2765-4349-80db-118114d4618b", "request_id": "8c2c98628efaa268-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa20123-2765-4349-80db-118114d4618b", "children": ["aaa2ef6f-8a87-47dd-8899-10dd362c001e"]}, "aaa2ef6f-8a87-47dd-8899-10dd362c001e": {"id": "aaa2ef6f-8a87-47dd-8899-10dd362c001e", "message": {"id": "aaa2ef6f-8a87-47dd-8899-10dd362c001e", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726277474.041024, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["where does that first christian emperor come into play?

He was initially a co-emperor in a tetrarchy system but eventually became the sole ruler of the Roman Empire.\n\n### Key Events in Constantine\u2019s Life:\n1. **Rise to Power**:\n   - Constantine was proclaimed emperor by his troops in 306 CE after the death of his father, Constantius Chlorus.\n   - Over the following years, Constantine fought a series of battles to consolidate power, including the famous Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 CE.\n\n2. **Conversion to Christianity**:\n   - According to Christian tradition, Constantine converted to Christianity before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. He reportedly saw a vision of a cross in the sky with the words &quot;In this sign, you will conquer&quot; (Latin: *In hoc signo vinces*).\n   - After his victory, Constantine attributed his success to the Christian God and began to favor Christianity throughout the empire.\n\n3. **Edict of Milan (313 CE)**:\n   - Constantine, along with his co-emperor Licinius, issued the Edict of Milan in 313 CE. This proclamation granted religious tolerance throughout the empire, particularly towards Christians, who had previously faced periods of persecution.\n\n4. **Council of Nicaea (325 CE)**:\n   - Constantine played a crucial role in convening the First Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. This was the first ecumenical council of the Christian Church, and it aimed to address heresies like Arianism and to establish a unified Christian doctrine, resulting in the Nicene Creed.\n\n5. **Foundation of Constantinople**:\n   - In 330 CE, Constantine founded a new capital for the Roman Empire in the East, which he named Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul). This city became a major center of Christian culture and power.\n\n### Constantine\u2019s Legacy:\n- **Christianity\u2019s Rise**: Constantine\u2019s support for Christianity played a vital role in its spread throughout the Roman Empire and its transition from a persecuted faith to the dominant religion.\n- **The Shift in Roman Culture**: Constantine\u2019s reign marked the beginning of the transformation of the Roman Empire from a primarily pagan society to a Christian one.\n- **Baptism and Death**: Constantine was baptized as a Christian shortly before his death in 337 CE, further cementing his legacy as the first Christian emperor.\n\n### Context in the Roman Empire:\n- **Christianity\u2019s Status Pre-Constantine**: Before Constantine, Christians were often persecuted, especially during the reigns of emperors like Nero and Diocletian.\n- **Impact on the Empire**: Constantine\u2019s reign significantly influenced the later history of the Roman Empire, especially as Christianity became more deeply intertwined with the state, leading to the establishment of the Byzantine Empire as a predominantly Christian state after the division of the Roman Empire.\n\nConstantine\u2019s embrace of Christianity and the subsequent Christianization of the Roman Empire were pivotal moments that reshaped the religious and cultural landscape of Europe and the Mediterranean for centuries to come."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2ef6f-8a87-47dd-8899-10dd362c001e", "request_id": "8c2c9dc30f9074e4-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2ef6f-8a87-47dd-8899-10dd362c001e", "children": ["aaa289dd-7546-4bb2-a48d-9b346e0f0855"]}, "aaa289dd-7546-4bb2-a48d-9b346e0f0855": {"id": "aaa289dd-7546-4bb2-a48d-9b346e0f0855", "message": {"id": "aaa289dd-7546-4bb2-a48d-9b346e0f0855", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726277731.691679, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["micae result in the first scsm with the ethiopians ending up doing they own thing? and didn&#x27;t byzantium go al orthodox resulting in the 2nd? schism?

Let\u2019s break down your questions about the early schisms and the role of the Ethiopian Church, as well as the later Byzantine split.\n\n### 1. The First Major Schism: The Council of Chalcedon and the Ethiopian Church\nThe first major schism in Christian history that led to significant divisions within the Church occurred in the 5th century, following the Council of Chalcedon.\n\n#### The Council of Chalcedon (451 CE)\n- **Background**: The Council of Chalcedon was convened by Emperor Marcian to address the Christological debates that had been raging in the Church. The primary issue was the nature of Christ\u2014whether he was of two natures (divine and human) or one nature.\n- **Chalcedonian Definition**: The Council declared that Christ has two natures, divine and human, united in one person &quot;without confusion, change, division, or separation.&quot; This became known as the Chalcedonian Definition.\n  \n#### The Schism with Non-Chalcedonian Churches\n- **Miaphysitism**: Some Christian communities, including the Coptic Church in Egypt, the Syriac Orthodox Church, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, rejected the Chalcedonian Definition. They adhered to Miaphysitism, which holds that Christ has one united nature (a composite of divine and human).\n- **Resulting Schism**: This theological disagreement led to the first major schism in the Church. The Non-Chalcedonian (Oriental Orthodox) Churches, including the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, separated from the Chalcedonian (Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic) Churches.\n- **Ethiopian Church**: The Ethiopian Church, which had received Christianity from the Coptic Church of Alexandria, rejected the Chalcedonian Definition and continued to follow the Miaphysite doctrine. This established the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church as part of the Oriental Orthodox communion.\n\n### 2. The Second Major Schism: The East-West Schism (1054 CE)\nThe second major schism in Christian history is often referred to as the East-West Schism or the Great Schism of 1054.\n\n#### Causes of the Schism\n- **Doctrinal Differences**: Over the centuries, theological, liturgical, and political differences grew between the Eastern (Byzantine) and Western (Latin) branches of the Church. One key doctrinal dispute was the *Filioque* clause, which was added to the Nicene Creed by the Western Church. The clause states that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father &quot;and the Son&quot; (*Filioque*), which the Eastern Church rejected.\n- **Papal Authority**: Another significant issue was the question of papal authority. The Roman Church asserted the primacy of the Pope over all Christians, while the Eastern Church maintained that the Patriarch of Constantinople was equal to the Pope, with no supreme authority over the other.\n\n#### The Schism\n- **Mutual Excommunication**: The official split occurred in 1054 CE when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch Michael I Cerularius excommunicated each other. This act symbolized the growing rift between the Eastern and Western Churches.\n- **Resulting Churches**: The schism resulted in the formation of the Roman Catholic Church in the West and the Eastern Orthodox Church in the East.\n\n### Summary of Schisms\n- **First Schism** (Council of Chalcedon, 451 CE): Led to the separation of the Non-Chalcedonian (Oriental Orthodox) Churches, including the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, from the Chalcedonian (Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic) Churches.\n- **Second Schism** (East-West Schism, 1054 CE): Resulted in the split between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, primarily over issues of doctrine, liturgy, and papal authority.\n\nThese schisms were pivotal in shaping the Christian world, leading to the development of distinct Christian traditions and churches that continue to exist to this day."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa289dd-7546-4bb2-a48d-9b346e0f0855", "request_id": "8c2ca40d6a0474e4-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa289dd-7546-4bb2-a48d-9b346e0f0855", "children": ["aaa27a43-32b7-4962-8f89-1a6c629eb3e5"]}, "aaa27a43-32b7-4962-8f89-1a6c629eb3e5": {"id": "aaa27a43-32b7-4962-8f89-1a6c629eb3e5", "message": {"id": "aaa27a43-32b7-4962-8f89-1a6c629eb3e5", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726277943.18969, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["where does oriental  come into play? ethiopia, alexandria both in africa"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "targeted_reply": "This established the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church as part of the Oriental Orthodox communion.", "request_id": "8c2ca9376f8b74e4-FCO", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "4a9b1c63-090d-4914-89db-f31ff1bd0eb8", "children": ["cdc055e4-2fe1-4e3f-bb6c-202d79463cc3"]}, "cdc055e4-2fe1-4e3f-bb6c-202d79463cc3": {"id": "cdc055e4-2fe1-4e3f-bb6c-202d79463cc3", "message": {"id": "cdc055e4-2fe1-4e3f-bb6c-202d79463cc3", "author": {"role": "system", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726277943.190228, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8c2ca9376f8b74e4-FCO", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null, "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa27a43-32b7-4962-8f89-1a6c629eb3e5", "children": ["fb6afc29-35dd-49cf-bba4-0e1f99b93074"]}, "fb6afc29-35dd-49cf-bba4-0e1f99b93074": {"id": "fb6afc29-35dd-49cf-bba4-0e1f99b93074", "message": {"id": "fb6afc29-35dd-49cf-bba4-0e1f99b93074", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726277956.240165, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The term &quot;Oriental Orthodox&quot; refers to a group of Christian churches that share similar theological beliefs and traditions, particularly in their rejection of the Council of Chalcedon&#x27;s decisions in 451 CE.

Instead, these churches hold to Miaphysitism, which teaches that Christ has one united nature that is both fully divine and fully human.\n- **Historical Usage**: Historically, the term &quot;Oriental&quot; was used by Western Christians to distinguish these non-Chalcedonian churches from the Eastern Orthodox churches, which accepted the Chalcedonian Definition. Over time, &quot;Oriental Orthodox&quot; became a standard term to describe this group of churches.\n\n### Churches Included in the Oriental Orthodox Communion:\n1. **Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria**: Based in Egypt, this church is one of the oldest Christian communities and played a central role in the spread of Christianity in Africa and the Middle East.\n2. **Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church**: The Ethiopian Church, which received Christianity through the Coptic Church of Alexandria, is a key member of the Oriental Orthodox communion. &quot;Tewahedo&quot; means &quot;united&quot; or &quot;made one,&quot; reflecting their belief in Christ&#x27;s united nature.\n3. **Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church**: This church was part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church until it became autocephalous (independent) in 1993.\n4. **Syriac Orthodox Church**: Based primarily in the Middle East, this church also rejected the Chalcedonian Definition and shares a similar Christological perspective.\n5. **Armenian Apostolic Church**: One of the oldest Christian communities, it rejected the Council of Chalcedon and is a key part of the Oriental Orthodox communion.\n6. **Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church**: Based in India, this church traces its origins to the apostolic missions and joined the Oriental Orthodox communion due to its shared Christological beliefs.\n\n### Geographic Spread\n- **Africa**: The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are based in Africa. Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the major centers of early Christianity.\n- **Middle East**: The Syriac Orthodox Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church are primarily based in the Middle East.\n- **India**: The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church represents the Oriental Orthodox tradition in South Asia.\n\n### Conclusion\nAlthough Ethiopia and Alexandria are geographically in Africa, the term &quot;Oriental Orthodox&quot; refers to the theological and historical distinctions that these churches share with other non-Chalcedonian churches in the broader &quot;eastern&quot; regions of the early Christian world.

The &quot;Occident&quot; referred to the Western world, primarily Europe and later the Americas.\n  \n2. **Geographical and Cultural Division**: The designation &quot;Oriental&quot; was used to describe anything that was culturally or geographically outside of the European context, particularly in regions that were not part of the Western Christian tradition. This included parts of North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In this sense, &quot;Oriental&quot; wasn&#x27;t necessarily about strict geography but about cultural and religious distinctions from a European viewpoint.\n\n3. **Africa in Historical Context**: During the early centuries of Christianity, Africa as a concept was largely focused on North Africa, which was an integral part of the Roman Empire. Places like Egypt (home to the Coptic Church) were seen as part of the &quot;Orient&quot; from a European perspective. Sub-Saharan Africa was less integrated into the Mediterranean world and thus often overlooked in these broad categorizations.\n\n### Conceptualizing Africa\n- **Africa as a Concept**: The idea of Africa as a distinct continent with its own identity evolved over time. In ancient and medieval times, what we now consider Africa was often divided into &quot;Libya&quot; (which referred to much of North Africa), &quot;Aethiopia&quot; (which referred to the regions south of Egypt, including modern-day Ethiopia), and other regional distinctions. The modern conception of Africa as a unified continent came later, particularly with European exploration and colonization.\n\n- **&quot;Oriental&quot; Label**: Given the Eurocentric lens, anything that wasn\u2019t considered part of the &quot;Western&quot; world, including North Africa and the Middle East, was often labeled as &quot;Oriental.&quot; This was more about distinguishing between the &quot;familiar&quot; European world and the &quot;exotic&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot; cultures of the East and South.\n\n### Reflection on Historical Terminology\nThe way these terms were used reflects the worldview of the time, which often categorized people and places in ways that were simplistic or even biased. Today, these terms are recognized as part of a Eurocentric framework that doesn&#x27;t fully capture the diversity and complexity of the regions they describe.\n\n### Conclusion\nYou&#x27;re correct in sensing that the term &quot;Oriental&quot; was broadly applied to regions outside of the European cultural sphere, including parts of Africa. It\u2019s a term that reflects historical perspectives rather than accurate geographical or cultural distinctions as we understand them today. Over time, the understanding and categorization of different regions, including Africa, have evolved, leading to more nuanced and respectful ways of describing the world&#x27;s diversity.\n\nIf you have more thoughts on this or any other topic, feel free to share!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "e4ffd26d-38bf-4d61-9694-52c56fd2a69a", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c2cac6fbcf174e4-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "e4ffd26d-38bf-4d61-9694-52c56fd2a69a", "children": ["aaa2ac36-224a-49c0-987a-593e08723b6f"]}, "aaa2ac36-224a-49c0-987a-593e08723b6f": {"id": "aaa2ac36-224a-49c0-987a-593e08723b6f", "message": {"id": "aaa2ac36-224a-49c0-987a-593e08723b6f", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726278459.294804, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["i&#x27;m wandering far away from the main idea  but in sub saharan africa, what were they doing during this period?

Here\u2019s a brief overview:\n\n1. **West Africa**:\n   - **Nok Culture (c. 1000 BCE - 300 CE)**: The Nok civilization in present-day Nigeria is one of the earliest known cultures in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Nok people are famous for their terracotta sculptures and early iron-smelting technology.\n   - **Early States**: By the end of the 1st millennium CE, powerful states such as the Ghana Empire (not to be confused with modern Ghana) were emerging in West Africa. The Ghana Empire was a trading powerhouse, dealing in gold, salt, and other goods with North Africa.\n\n2. **East Africa**:\n   - **Axum (c. 100 CE - 940 CE)**: Located in present-day Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Kingdom of Axum was a significant power in East Africa and the Red Sea region. Axum was heavily involved in trade, and its rulers adopted Christianity in the 4th century, becoming one of the first Christian kingdoms in the world.\n   - **Swahili Coast**: By the 7th century, the coastal cities of East Africa were beginning to emerge as important trading hubs. These cities, part of the Swahili culture, would later become prominent in trade with the Middle East, India, and beyond.\n\n3. **Central and Southern Africa**:\n   - **Bantu Migrations**: During this period, Bantu-speaking peoples were continuing their migrations across Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa. These migrations spread agriculture, ironworking, and Bantu languages across much of Sub-Saharan Africa.\n   - **Great Zimbabwe**: While its peak was later (11th-15th centuries), the area that would become the Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe was beginning to develop complex societies, eventually leading to the construction of the famous stone city.\n\n### North Africa During the Same Period\nIn North Africa, civilizations like Carthage, Egypt, and later the Roman and Byzantine Empires were influential, and many people in this region shared cultural ties with the broader Mediterranean world.\n\n- **Carthage**: A major power before its destruction by Rome in 146 BCE, Carthage was located in present-day Tunisia. Its influence spread across much of the western Mediterranean.\n- **Roman and Byzantine Rule**: North Africa became a key part of the Roman Empire, with cities like Carthage and Alexandria becoming important centers of trade, culture, and early Christianity.\n- **Berbers**: Indigenous to North Africa, Berber peoples (also known as Amazigh) lived across the region. Many Berbers converted to Islam after the Arab conquests in the 7th century CE, but before that, they were involved in various trade networks and often interacted with the Roman Empire.\n\n### Ancestry and Genealogy in the African Diaspora\nThe African diaspora, particularly due to the transatlantic slave trade, resulted in millions of people of African descent living in the Americas. Determining the specific origins of individuals in the diaspora can be complex, but here are some key points:\n\n1. **Sub-Saharan Ancestry**:\n   - Most African Americans trace their ancestry to Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly regions that are now part of West Africa (e.g., Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Angola).\n   - The transatlantic slave trade primarily sourced enslaved people from West and Central Africa, with some also coming from parts of Southeast Africa.\n\n2. **North African Ancestry**:\n   - It\u2019s less common but not impossible for African Americans to have ancestry from North Africa. However, the majority of the enslaved people who were brought to the Americas came from Sub-Saharan Africa.\n   - North African people do have diverse appearances, including a range of skin tones and hair textures, which can overlap with those found in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the region&#x27;s complex history of migrations and interactions.\n\n3. **African Diversity**:\n   - Africa is incredibly diverse, with a wide range of ethnic groups, cultures, and appearances. While dark skin and coarse hair are common features across many African populations, these traits can be found in both Sub-Saharan and North African peoples.\n\n4. **Genetic Testing**:\n   - Modern genetic testing services can help trace ancestry by analyzing DNA and comparing it to genetic markers from different regions. These tests often reveal a mix of ancestries, reflecting the complex history of human migration, especially in the African diaspora.\n\n### Conclusion\nIt\u2019s very likely that your ancestry traces back to Sub-Saharan Africa, given the history of the transatlantic slave trade. However, Africa\u2019s diversity means there could be a mix of influences, potentially including North African ancestry. Understanding your roots involves exploring both the historical context and, if you&#x27;re interested, possibly using genetic testing to get a clearer picture.\n\nIf you have more questions about history, culture, or anything else, feel free to ask!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4o", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2ac36-224a-49c0-987a-593e08723b6f", "request_id": "8c2cb5d0edd80e46-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2ac36-224a-49c0-987a-593e08723b6f", "children": ["aaa2eb8b-a8f8-4d34-8c63-87355019e0b2"]}, "aaa2eb8b-a8f8-4d34-8c63-87355019e0b2": {"id": "aaa2eb8b-a8f8-4d34-8c63-87355019e0b2", "message": {"id": "aaa2eb8b-a8f8-4d34-8c63-87355019e0b2", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726278927.86745, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["+-"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8c2cc1418de40e13-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "ebe5eeba-63e9-4d44-816b-5d97f1788a13", "children": ["e340d80c-eac9-42e4-a5a7-793afbcb4f86"]}, "e340d80c-eac9-42e4-a5a7-793afbcb4f86": {"id": "e340d80c-eac9-42e4-a5a7-793afbcb4f86", "message": {"id": "e340d80c-eac9-42e4-a5a7-793afbcb4f86", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726278929.449681, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["It seems like you might have sent a message by accident or left it unfinished.

At a previous role as a **Customer Success Manager at Acadly Inc.**, we worked with large volumes of user data. By ensuring all data transmissions were encrypted, we significantly minimized the risk of data breaches, especially when collaborating with various stakeholders who accessed data remotely.\n\n**Access control** is another critical measure. During my time at CSX as a **Manager of Operations and Data Control**, we dealt with highly sensitive operational data. To safeguard this, I implemented strict access control protocols, ensuring that only authorized personnel could access sensitive files, thereby reducing potential internal threats.\n\nI also learned the importance of **regular audits**. At Revature, we conducted quarterly system checks for security vulnerabilities in our software. This ensured that any potential data risks were flagged and addressed before they could escalate. This type of proactivity in auditing is essential in the fast-paced environment of new technology.\n\n**Data minimization** is a principle that I believe is often underutilized. By only collecting the data necessary for operations, companies can significantly reduce their exposure to security risks. At Commercial Fire, for example, we streamlined the types of data collected for inspections, which not only sped up our processes but also reduced the burden of protecting excess data.\n\nOne of the most important lessons from my career has been the value of **staff training**. At CSX, where I led large teams, I ensured all staff received regular training on best practices for data handling and security. This not only empowered them to use the technology securely but also fostered a culture of accountability.\n\nFinally, keeping up with **tech updates** is critical. During my experience as a **Software Development Associate at Revature**, I saw firsthand how outdated systems can be a gateway for vulnerabilities. Consistently updating software to patch potential security flaws should be a non-negotiable practice for any organization.\n\nIn summary, through a mix of encryption, access control, regular audits, data minimization, training, and technology updates, I have successfully implemented measures that ensured data security while leveraging new technology across various industries."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "52532efb-2635-4f41-827b-dbe43b0205a4", "request_id": "8c1942fa2c8e3746-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "52532efb-2635-4f41-827b-dbe43b0205a4", "children": ["aaa2dd94-44f0-42c3-bcb0-9dda58f822c1"]}, "aaa2dd94-44f0-42c3-bcb0-9dda58f822c1": {"id": "aaa2dd94-44f0-42c3-bcb0-9dda58f822c1", "message": {"id": "aaa2dd94-44f0-42c3-bcb0-9dda58f822c1", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726074663.967957, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["okay this is good but only reference one job, like the csx manager of operations and data control example for the rest just take the tone of aan expert who seen how these policies work"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8c194657580a3746-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "9353105e-54d9-4579-99d9-55b3ffc9c420", "children": ["1f497be4-f6a6-4541-92e9-ebc47b005e98"]}, "1f497be4-f6a6-4541-92e9-ebc47b005e98": {"id": "1f497be4-f6a6-4541-92e9-ebc47b005e98", "message": {"id": "1f497be4-f6a6-4541-92e9-ebc47b005e98", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726074686.247637, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["User prefers answers referencing only one job example while keeping a tone of an expert who has seen how policies work."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": false, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "pad": "AAAAA", "parent_id": "aaa2dd94-44f0-42c3-bcb0-9dda58f822c1", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200007]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c194657580a3746-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "bio", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2dd94-44f0-42c3-bcb0-9dda58f822c1", "children": ["3212f1f6-ad63-4bf4-bddc-81870705c4f7"]}, "3212f1f6-ad63-4bf4-bddc-81870705c4f7": {"id": "3212f1f6-ad63-4bf4-bddc-81870705c4f7", "message": {"id": "3212f1f6-ad63-4bf4-bddc-81870705c4f7", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "bio", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726074686.24779, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Model set context updated."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"kwargs": {"message_id": "3212f1f6-ad63-4bf4-bddc-81870705c4f7", "pending_message_id": null}, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "pad": "AA", "parent_id": "1f497be4-f6a6-4541-92e9-ebc47b005e98", "request_id": "8c194657580a3746-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "assistant", "channel": null}, "parent": "1f497be4-f6a6-4541-92e9-ebc47b005e98", "children": ["7dae78f0-6259-4482-bc6d-661e30aaf92e"]}, "7dae78f0-6259-4482-bc6d-661e30aaf92e": {"id": "7dae78f0-6259-4482-bc6d-661e30aaf92e", "message": {"id": "7dae78f0-6259-4482-bc6d-661e30aaf92e", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726074686.247859, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To safeguard data privacy and security in client interactions with new technology, it\u2019s essential to use a multi-faceted approach, combining encryption tools, access control, regular audits, data minimization, staff training, and tech updates. \n\nFor instance, during my time as **Manager of Operations and Data Control at CSX**, I was responsible for handling critical operational data. Implementing **encryption tools** allowed us to protect sensitive information in transit, ensuring that any communication involving our logistics data was secure from potential breaches. This step is foundational in maintaining the confidentiality of client interactions.\n\nEqually important is **access control**. Restricting data access to only those who need it minimizes the risk of internal breaches. By assigning clear permissions and maintaining up-to-date records of who has access to what, you can drastically reduce exposure to sensitive information. I have seen firsthand how implementing tiered access control adds a vital layer of security, preventing data from falling into the wrong hands.\n\n**Regular audits** are also crucial. These allow you to identify vulnerabilities early and ensure compliance with evolving data privacy standards. In my experience, audits don\u2019t just catch security flaws; they also help streamline operations by identifying inefficiencies in data management. Conducting these audits consistently strengthens the overall security posture.\n\nAdopting **data minimization** practices limits your exposure. The less data you collect, the less you need to secure. By focusing on essential data points, companies can reduce the risks associated with holding large volumes of potentially vulnerable information. This is particularly critical in the context of client interactions, where trust is paramount.\n\nTraining staff on **data privacy best practices** ensures that human error is minimized. Even with the most advanced technology, a lack of awareness can undermine security efforts. Making sure your team understands the importance of security and how to handle client data properly is one of the most effective ways to safeguard against breaches.\n\nFinally, staying on top of **tech updates** is a non-negotiable practice. Technology evolves rapidly, and new vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. By updating systems and applying patches regularly, you can prevent many potential attacks before they happen.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, businesses can not only secure client interactions but also build trust and foster stronger relationships."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "3212f1f6-ad63-4bf4-bddc-81870705c4f7", "request_id": "8c194657580a3746-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "3212f1f6-ad63-4bf4-bddc-81870705c4f7", "children": ["aaa20c70-fda3-4201-8076-dc06f575e231"]}, "aaa20c70-fda3-4201-8076-dc06f575e231": {"id": "aaa20c70-fda3-4201-8076-dc06f575e231", "message": {"id": "aaa20c70-fda3-4201-8076-dc06f575e231", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726074775.250681, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["SAY ENCRYPTION TOOLS IN TERMS OF DATA STORAGE AND THEN USE &quot;WOULD HAVE LANGUAGGE FOR THE REST OF THE CSX STUFF"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"serialization_metadata": {"custom_symbol_offsets": []}, "request_id": "8c19490ec8f53746-MXP", "message_source": null, "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7dae78f0-6259-4482-bc6d-661e30aaf92e", "children": ["4555ef14-c57d-4014-82a5-979dc8fed8da"]}, "4555ef14-c57d-4014-82a5-979dc8fed8da": {"id": "4555ef14-c57d-4014-82a5-979dc8fed8da", "message": {"id": "4555ef14-c57d-4014-82a5-979dc8fed8da", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726074790.183258, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": [""]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "parent_id": "aaa20c70-fda3-4201-8076-dc06f575e231", "request_id": "8c19490ec8f53746-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa20c70-fda3-4201-8076-dc06f575e231", "children": ["7580648d-86fd-4de5-8000-5251e683c8c3"]}, "7580648d-86fd-4de5-8000-5251e683c8c3": {"id": "7580648d-86fd-4de5-8000-5251e683c8c3", "message": {"id": "7580648d-86fd-4de5-8000-5251e683c8c3", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726074790.183375, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["To safeguard data privacy and security, **encryption tools** play a vital role, especially when it comes to data storage.

With the vast amounts of information we handled daily, it was critical to ensure only authorized personnel could access certain data points. By reviewing access rights regularly, we reduced internal risks and maintained operational efficiency, securing data while allowing the business to function smoothly. This experience made it clear how vital it is for organizations to adopt a multi-layered approach to data privacy and security.\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving tech landscape, businesses must go beyond basic measures to protect sensitive data. According to a 2023 report by IBM, the global average cost of a data breach reached $4.45 million, a figure that continues to rise due to the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. To mitigate such risks, companies should focus on six core strategies.\n\nFirst, **encryption tools** are essential, especially when it comes to stored data. Encrypting both in-transit and at-rest data ensures that even in the event of a breach, sensitive information remains secure. It\u2019s important to adopt industry-standard encryption protocols to protect client interactions and data from unauthorized access.\n\nSecond, **access control** should be a priority. Implementing strict access rights based on role or necessity helps ensure that only those who need access to certain data can obtain it. This not only reduces the risk of internal breaches but also enhances accountability, as every data interaction is traceable.\n\n**Regular audits** are also crucial to maintaining security. These checks help identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with privacy regulations, and offer opportunities to improve security protocols. While I wasn\u2019t directly involved in audits at CSX, I saw their value firsthand as a key measure to catch potential issues before they escalate.\n\n**Data minimization** is another effective strategy. By only collecting the information absolutely necessary for business operations, companies can reduce their exposure to data breaches. This principle also helps streamline compliance efforts and decreases the risk of sensitive information being mishandled or exposed.\n\nEqually important is **staff training**. Employees must be well-versed in handling data securely. Regular training sessions should cover the latest best practices in data privacy, ensuring that all team members are aware of their role in protecting client information. Human error remains a leading cause of data breaches, so this is a critical piece of the puzzle.\n\nLastly, **keeping systems up to date** is non-negotiable. Many breaches occur because companies fail to apply software patches that address known vulnerabilities. Staying current with tech updates is one of the easiest and most effective ways to keep systems secure in the face of new threats.\n\nBy adopting a robust approach that includes encryption, access control, audits, data minimization, staff training, and timely tech updates, businesses can significantly reduce their risk of data breaches, protecting both their operations and their clients&#x27; trust."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": true, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"citations": [], "content_references": [], "gizmo_id": null, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4o", "default_model_slug": "auto", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "742eb9e4-0d1c-4b81-aba0-8e06c9266202", "finish_details": {"type": "stop", "stop_tokens": [200002]}, "is_complete": true, "request_id": "8c19514f4b193746-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "742eb9e4-0d1c-4b81-aba0-8e06c9266202", "children": ["aaa20f10-2c38-489d-aa4e-335df1843a10"]}, "aaa20f10-2c38-489d-aa4e-335df1843a10": {"id": "aaa20f10-2c38-489d-aa4e-335df1843a10", "message": {"id": "aaa20f10-2c38-489d-aa4e-335df1843a10", "author": {"role": "user", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1726075237.92173, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Can I say: During my time....

This isn&#x27;t a direct benefit to your hair&#x27;s health, but it might improve your mood and make the hair care experience more enjoyable.\n\n2. **Antioxidant Properties**: Orange peels contain antioxidants which can help protect the hair and scalp from oxidative stress and damage from pollutants and UV rays.\n\n3. **Enhanced Circulation**: Cinnamon is known to stimulate circulation. Applying it to the scalp might increase blood flow, potentially promoting hair growth. However, this is more theoretical and results can vary widely.\n\n4. **Natural Shine**: The oils from orange peels might help in adding a slight shine to your hair.\n\n### Timeline and Things to Watch For:\n- **Immediate**: You might notice an immediate change in the fragrance of your hair and possibly a slight increase in shine.\n- **Over Time**: If any benefits to scalp health or hair growth are to be seen from the improved circulation due to cinnamon, it would take several weeks or months of consistent use to notice.\n\n### Cautions:\n- **Allergic Reactions**: Both cinnamon and orange can be irritants or allergens for some people. It&#x27;s important to do a patch test before applying the mixture extensively to avoid allergic reactions or irritation.\n- **Dryness**: Cinnamon can be drying for some hair types. If your hair feels dry or brittle, you might want to reduce the frequency of application or add a moisturizing component to your mixture.\n\nIf you&#x27;re looking to achieve specific results, such as enhanced growth or moisture, there might be more targeted treatments available.

Without his insightful sociological and philosophical perspectives this project would not have been possible. Even though I began this research project years before meeting him his strong opinions and unique influencer preferences such as Omegaclick have greatly influenced and shaped its development. I am grateful for his influence and mindful of its significance.\nI would like to thank my sister Tammara who has always encouraged and supported me in my educational undertakings. Her introduction to the concept of mindful living has had a profoundly positive effect on my outlook and life experiences. In that vein I also want to thank Claremont Lincoln University and the handful of influencers who have focused their influence on promoting mindfulness. When I am mindful I am aware and leading myself! You are doing good work; you are helping people. \nFinally I would like to thank God. I agree with the anonymous author of the acknowledgment sample in the capstone project template who wrote:\n\n\u201cYou are the one who let me finish my degree. I will keep on trusting you for my future.\u201d \n\nFrom Tweets to Change: Social Media&#x27;s Role in Contemporary Leadership\nCHAPTER 1: Introduction\nThe author\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is suspicious. He does not trust easily and always looks beyond what people say to determine their meaning. Consequently he is very hard to manipulate and very hard to influence and as such he is very hard to lead; he prefers to be in charge. Therefore he is skilled in convincing people. He knows how to influence others and lead people because as Northouse (2019) asserts leadership is an influence process.\nUnlike the author\u2019s fianc\u00e9 a significant portion of the population does not delve deeply into the authenticity of the information they receive; 18% of Americans report that social media has a significant impact on their voting decisions and 55% consider it their primary news source according to a 2019 Pew Research study. This widespread influence of social media raises a compelling question about the nature of leadership in the digital era. Building on Northouse&#x27;s definition I intend to argue that the influence exerted by social media can be seen as a form of authentic leadership. This form of leadership practiced by social media influencers aligns closely with authentic leadership theory emphasizing transparency ethics and a focus on the communal good. Through their pervasive reach and often personal engagement with followers these influencers craft a modern leadership narrative that significantly shapes public opinions and societal values.\nSocial Significance\nThe influence of social media is profound and ubiquitous reaching across all sectors of society. According to the Pew Research Center approximately 72% of the U.S. public uses some type of social media with varying impacts on social political and community engagement (Pew Research Center 2021). The breadth of this influence spans across diverse demographic groups making nearly everyone a potential recipient of communicated messages whether accurate or misleading.\nThe potential benefits of this influence include increased awareness and mobilization for social causes as seen with movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter which have propelled significant societal shifts and brought critical issues to the forefront of global awareness. Social media influencers have played crucial roles in these movements utilizing their platforms to amplify voices and call for action. For instance prominent figures like Alyssa Milano and Tarana Burke have used their influence to promote the #MeToo movement leading to widespread discussions about sexual harassment and assault (Mendes et al. 2018).\nHowever the risks involve the spread of misinformation and manipulating public opinion which can polarize communities and disrupt democratic processes. The cost of such influence can be seen in the widespread controversies surrounding elections and public policy debates where influencers have swayed public sentiment through both genuine and questionable means. For example during the 2016 U.S. presidential election false information disseminated by social media influencers and bots was found to have significantly impacted voter perceptions and behaviors (Allcott &amp; Gentzkow 2017).\nThe individuals most impacted by this phenomenon include young adults who are the most active on platforms like Instagram and TikTok and are particularly susceptible to influencer marketing and political campaigns (Auxier &amp; Anderson 2021). This demographic&#x27;s high engagement levels highlight the critical need to understand the mechanisms of influence and leadership within these digital platforms. Research indicates that young people trust influencers more than traditional celebrities or politicians making them a key target for marketing and political messaging (Djafarova &amp; Rushworth 2017).\nIn addition to social movements and political implications the economic impact of social media influence is significant. Influencer marketing has become a multi-billion-dollar industry with brands leveraging the reach and authenticity of influencers to connect with consumers. According to a report by Business Insider Intelligence the influencer marketing industry is set to grow to approximately $15 billion by 2022 (Business Insider Intelligence 2021). This economic dimension underscores the dual nature of influencer power: while it offers opportunities for authentic brand engagement it also raises questions about ethics and transparency in advertising.\nThe social significance of social media influence is further highlighted by its role in mental health. Studies have shown that exposure to influencer content can impact self-esteem and body image particularly among young women. For example Fardouly et al. (2015) found that Instagram use was associated with greater body dissatisfaction mediated by the internalization of the thin ideal and appearance comparison tendencies. These findings suggest that while influencers can promote positive messages they also have the potential to contribute to harmful social norms.\nConclusion\nThis research project is situated at the intersection of leadership theory and digital media studies. It aims to critically analyze the role of social media influencers as contemporary leaders who not only entertain but also significantly influence societal values and norms. By aligning the characteristics of social media leadership with authentic leadership theories this study will evaluate the authenticity and ethical considerations of influencers&#x27; practices. The findings are expected to provide insights into how digital platforms can be harnessed for responsible and effective leadership promoting positive change while mitigating risks associated with digital influence. This foundational exploration sets the stage for a detailed literature review in Chapter 2 where theories of leadership and empirical studies on digital influence will be synthesized to build a comprehensive framework for understanding leadership in the digital age. \n\n\nCHAPTER 2: Identification of Phenomenon\n\nThe author&#x27;s fianc\u00e9 does not consider social media such as TikTok and Twitter as reliable sources of information. He feels that government leaders and politicians undermine the seriousness and importance of their positions when they use lighthearted TikTok videos to promote their message or agenda. Additionally he believes that such displays reflect the sensationalism and showmanship of American politics. In contrast to the author&#x27;s fiance&#x27;s opinion a Pew Research study in 2023 found that over 50% of adults surveyed reported getting their news from social media at least sometimes (Social Media and News Fact Sheet 2023).\nOn July 21st 2024 President Joe Biden announced his decision not to seek re-election in the fall. This historic announcement marking the first time in over fifty years that a sitting president refused their party&#x27;s nomination was made using the platform now known as X (Mason et al. 2024). The use of social media highlights its efficiency in disseminating information and providing individuals with the opportunity to engage in the public sphere gain followers and exert influence on an unprecedented scale.\nSocial media has emerged as a formidable force influencing public opinions and attitudes in the contemporary digital era. This phenomenon where social media shapes and reflects public opinions is particularly significant when examined through authentic leadership theory. Authentic leadership which emphasizes transparency ethics and a communal focus aligns closely with the activities of social media influencers who wield substantial sway over their followers.\nThe role of social media in influencing public opinion is pervasive and profound. Approximately 72% of the U.S. public uses social media with platforms like Facebook and YouTube leading the way (Auxier &amp; Anderson 2021). This extensive reach ensures that nearly everyone is exposed to the opinions and ideas circulated on these platforms whether accurate or misleading. The impact of social media is evident in various sectors from political engagement to social movements economic trends and mental health.\nTo investigate this phenomenon data was collected through a comprehensive literature review and qualitative analysis of social media interactions. The sources encompassed peer-reviewed articles books on leadership theories and empirical studies on social media&#x27;s influence. Reputable institutions such as the Pew Research Center provided statistical data on social media usage and its societal impacts.\nThe influence of social media on public opinion became noticeable in the early 21st century with the advent of platforms like Facebook Twitter and YouTube. Events such as the Arab Spring (2011) and Occupy Wall Street (2011) highlighted the power of social media to mobilize people and spread ideas rapidly. The #MeToo movement which gained momentum through a tweet by Alyssa Milano in 2017 exemplified how social media could catalyze significant social change by encouraging victims of sexual harassment to speak out (Thomson 2018).\nIn addition to social movements social media&#x27;s influence extends deeply into the political sphere. Modern political candidates in America have recognized the necessity of maintaining a robust online presence. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook are not only used for engagement but also for major announcements policy declarations and real-time interaction with constituents. For instance former President Donald Trump famously used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and announce significant policy decisions bypassing traditional media channels (Heilweil &amp; Ghaffary 2021). This direct communication method aligns with the principles of authentic leadership where transparency and direct engagement are paramount.\nAuthentic leadership as defined by Northouse (2019) is a process where an individual influences others to achieve a common goal through genuine and ethical behavior. This concept is mirrored in the actions of social media influencers who build trust and engagement with their followers through transparency and authenticity. Influencers and public figures like Tarana Burke and Alyssa Milano have utilized their platforms to lead movements such as #MeToo advocating for societal values of justice and accountability (Mendes et al. 2018). These influencers often exemplify the core components of authentic leadership by maintaining a transparent and genuine presence online fostering trust and loyalty among their followers. This trust is critical enabling influencers to mobilize their audience for various causes from social justice movements to political campaigns.\nSocial media acts as both a mirror and a mold for public opinion reflecting current sentiments and attitudes while simultaneously shaping those sentiments through disseminating information and mobilizing collective action. For instance during the 2016 U.S. presidential election social media significantly influenced voter perceptions through authentic content and misinformation (Allcott &amp; Gentzkow 2017). Furthermore the viral nature of social media can amplify certain viewpoints and contribute to the polarization of public discourse leading to the formation of echo chambers and the spread of disinformation.\nThe economic implications of social media influence are also significant. Influencer marketing has become a multi-billion-dollar industry with brands leveraging influencers&#x27; reach and perceived authenticity to connect with consumers. According to a report by Business Insider Intelligence the influencer marketing industry is projected to grow to approximately $15 billion by 2022 (Business Insider Intelligence 2021). As brands increasingly rely on influencers to reach consumers the line between genuine endorsement and paid promotion blurs raising questions about the authenticity of influencer content. This shift towards influencer-based marketing strategies reflects a broader change in how companies connect with their audiences prioritizing perceived authenticity over traditional advertising methods.\nWhile social media holds the potential for positive influence it also poses risks. The spread of misinformation can polarize communities and disrupt democratic processes. The controversies surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election exemplify this risk where false information disseminated by social media influencers and bots significantly impacted voter perceptions and behaviors (Allcott &amp; Gentzkow 2017). Moreover misinformation on social media is not merely a disruptor of public opinion but also a significant risk to public trust in democratic institutions. The spread of false information can create widespread confusion and skepticism undermining the credibility of both the media and the government. This dynamic was starkly illustrated during the 2016 U.S. presidential election when misinformation campaigns were used strategically to influence voter behavior and perceptions (Allcott &amp; Gentzkow 2017) a tactic that has only grown in sophistication with advancements in digital technology. \nIn addition the adverse influences of social media extend to mental health. Studies have shown that exposure to influencer content can impact self-esteem and body image particularly among young women. For instance Fardouly et al. (2015) found that Instagram use was associated with greater body dissatisfaction mediated by the internalization of the thin ideal and appearance comparison tendencies. Therefore it is crucial to be mindful of one&#x27;s social media consumption and to approach the ideas presented in social media mindfully actively using one&#x27;s critical thinking skills to help navigate the complex digital landscape and mitigate the potential negative impact of social media on mental well-being.\nConclusion\nThe role of social media in shaping and reflecting public opinions and attitudes is intricately linked with the principles of authentic leadership. Influencers who engage authentically with their followers can drive significant social change by promoting ethical behavior and communal values. As digital platforms continue to evolve understanding the mechanisms of this influence becomes crucial for harnessing social media&#x27;s power for positive societal impact. \n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3: Literature Review\nThe author&#x27;s fianc\u00e9 has the utter confidence needed to believe his thoughts and opinions add value to society. While those in academia consider whether or not their thoughts are new or if they add something to the literature the author&#x27;s fiance progresses boldly expressing his thoughts unfiltered. Furthermore he has opinions about everything! For example the author\u2019s fiance believes Donald Trump is created in the mold of Silvio Berlusconi and that for leaders like these any perception of authenticity one can glean from their social media has been crafted designed and molded to appear as such. The author\u2019s fiance often laments that nowadays due to social media and internet culture society&#x27;s memory spans only about five years. He remarks that people often and easily forget what has come before dooming all mistakes to be repeated. In contrast fortunately within academia the effects and reach of social media leadership and authenticity have been studied and discussed at length. In this chapter we will explore the various facets of authentic leadership its application and its intersection with social media as a tool for leadership and change.\nUnderstanding Authentic Leadership\nIn a world rife with uncertainty where workers are demanding greater accountability and morality from their leadership the need for authentic leadership is undeniable. As Northouse (2019) articulates people long for bona fide leadership that they can trust leaders who are honest and good. Although authentic leadership is still nascent in its philosophy many of the greatest minds in academia commerce and science have studied hypothesized and postulated on its methodology application and efficacy.\nGardner et al. (2005) provided a foundational understanding of authentic leadership by proposing a self-based model of the developmental processes for authentic leadership and followership. They emphasize the importance of self-awareness and self-regulation suggesting that these are fundamental components of authentic leadership development. According to their model a leader\u2019s personal history is the catalyst for authentic leadership development. This reflective perspective examines leader and follower roles highlighting how authentic leaders are positive role models who consistently exhibit balanced processing self-awareness and transparency. Despite the lack of concrete examples their comprehensive framework remains invaluable in examining authentic leadership theory.\nBerkovich (2014) extends this understanding by incorporating dialogical pedagogy in authentic leadership development. He critiques common approaches and suggests a new perspective based on dialogical philosophy outlining a framework for dialogical pedagogy. By identifying and discussing narrative identity processing and dramaturgical enactment Berkovich thoroughly examines the foundations and mechanics of dialogical pedagogy. His discourse on empathy mutuality and open-mindedness underscores the intricate nature of authentic leadership development making his contribution a significant expansion of Gardner et al. (2005) initial framework.\nThe primary theme expressed in both pieces of literature is that authentic leaders inspire followers by embodying the qualities and values that followers admire. For instance Donald Trump&#x27;s wealth outspokenness and confidence in his opinions despite being perceived as offensive by some are revered by his followers. Beyond merely agreeing with his message they admire his perceived authenticity candidness and charisma. \nApplication and Efficacy of Authentic Leadership\nPractical applications of authentic leadership have been examined through various lenses offering insights into its efficacy across different contexts. Qian et al. (2016) explore the cognitive and emotional mechanisms that impact feedback-seeking behavior within leader-follower relationships. They posit that authentic leadership indirectly influences feedback-seeking through employees&#x27; perceptions of value and cost and their positive emotions. This concentrated focus on feedback-seeking behavior provides deeper insights into authentic leadership&#x27;s cognitive and emotional dimensions. While predominantly theoretical their study is underpinned by credible sources bolstering its assertions. \nTheir research indicates that authentic leaders directly impact their followers at an individual level. The study also reveals the underlying psychological processes of authentic leadership providing a detailed understanding of how leaders can promote open communication and continuous improvement through empathetic and effective communication. The study confirms that the perception of the authentic leader as someone who embodies authenticity is crucial in inspiring and positively influencing followers.\nShifting the focus to group outcomes Rego et al. (2013) examine how authentic leadership directly and indirectly predicts team potency through the mediating role of team virtuousness and affective commitment. Their study conducted at a Portuguese university with 59 teams provides quantifiable results that suggest authentic leadership is associated with more virtuous committed and potent teams. This research is particularly valuable as it examines the effects of authentic leadership on group outcomes a rarity among studies that often focus on individual follower outcomes. The study&#x27;s findings are crucial for understanding the broader impacts of authentic leadership within teams and organizations. This focus on team outcomes rather than individual follower outcomes is particularly valuable for understanding the collective impact of authentic leadership within organizations and how it fosters a supportive high-performing work environment.\nShapira-Lishchinsky (2014) explores the development of authentic leadership through team-based simulations (TBSs) of ethical cases in the educational field. While TBSs created a supportive environment for learning from mistakes and heightening leader awareness of their caring responsibilities the study did not establish a strong correlation between simulations and authentic leadership development. Despite this limitation the detailed analysis of authentic leadership theory and methodology presented in the study offers valuable insights. These insights while specific to educational leaders have broader implications for the development of authentic leadership in various contexts.\nHsieh and Wang (2015) provide compelling evidence of the influence of authentic leadership on employee trust and engagement from a supervisor-employee perspective. Their study tested four hypotheses concerning employee and supervisor perceptions of authentic leadership and found that supervisor-perceived authentic leadership fully mediates employee work engagement through employee trust. The use of statistical data to present quantifiable results lends greater credibility to their conclusions offering a clear picture of the application of authentic leadership and its probable outcomes. \nIn contrast to other studies that primarily focused on outcomes Mehmood et al. (2016) examine the role of authentic leadership in employees\u2019 developmental goals and performance. Their study conducted with supervisors and employees in the Pakistani Telecommunications sector concludes that authentic leadership predicts followers&#x27; in-role and extra-role performance through learning goal orientation. As with other studies the presentation of quantifiable results lends credibility to the authors&#x27; conclusions although a deeper analysis of the research leading to their hypotheses would have been beneficial. This study emphasizes the developmental aspect of authentic leadership and its impact on employee performance.\tCollectively these findings underscore the importance of followers&#x27; perceptions of leadership trustworthiness and ethical behavior in fostering strong committed teams and communities. They highlight how communication and perception of the authenticity of leaders across different contexts is the primary mechanism of authentic leadership influence. The studies also demonstrate that the principles of authentic leadership are applicable across different sectors from education to corporate environments and are essential for sustaining long-term organizational success.\nAuthentic Leadership in Practice\nThe exploration of authentic leadership is not confined to academia. Blekkingh (2015) and Wulffers (2017) offer practical guides to achieving authenticity. Blekkingh\u2019s book &quot;Authentic Leadership: Discover and Live Your Essential Mission&quot; explores a seven-layer model for discovering one&#x27;s purpose and achieving authenticity. He suggests that through layered self-reflection individuals can find their authentic self and purpose and subsequently put authentic leadership into effect. Although the book is mainly anecdotal and lacks academic robustness its straightforward language and engaging exercises make it accessible and applicable to a broad audience. This practical approach to authentic leadership complements the theoretical frameworks discussed earlier.\nWulffers (2017) in &quot;Authentic Leadership Effectiveness for Individuals and Teams: A Coaching Approach&quot; examines the state of leadership today and the consequences of poor leadership. She presents authentic leadership theory as a critical method for achieving better quality leadership. Wulffers\u2019 book is an extended case study and detailed manual on achieving authenticity heavily referencing previous literature on authentic leadership theory. Her practical approach and endorsements by industry leaders enhance the book&#x27;s usefulness in authentic leadership theory research. This combination of practical advice and theoretical grounding makes it a valuable resource.\tKerfoot (2006) in particular bridges the gap between theory and practice by illustrating how authentic leadership can be applied in nursing where the perception of authenticity is crucial. She argues that leader authenticity cannot be self-defined but lies in followers\u2019 perceptions. Through mentoring and confidence one can create the perception of authenticity as a leader. This practical perspective is relevant and helpful to authentic leadership research offering context and application in a specific profession. Kerfoot\u2019s insights bridge the gap between theory and practice demonstrating the applicability of authentic leadership in professional settings.\nHer insights into mentoring and confidence-building provide valuable lessons for leaders in any field. She emphasizes that authenticity must be perceived by followers to be effective. Kerfoot ( 2006) illustrates the paramount importance of follower perception of authenticity as a mechanism of leadership influence. This perspective reinforces the idea that leadership is not just about self-perception but also about how others perceive the leader\u2019s authenticity making the external perception of authenticity as vital as the internal belief in it.\nThe Role of Authentic Leadership in Social Media Engagement\n\tGardner et al. (2005) provide a foundational framework of authentic leadership illustrating mechanisms that facilitate cultivating a genuine online following. Adhering to principles of authentic leadership and living within one&#x27;s purpose enables the use of social media as a powerful tool to broadcast authenticity to a broader audience. It is essential to acknowledge that social media carries various risks. Purposeful and conscientious interaction with these platforms can help to alleviate these risks fostering a more substantial and beneficial engagement with digital content. \nBuilding on this foundation Berkovich (2014) underscores the importance of empathy and open dialogue in cultivating authentic interactions. This approach proves essential within platforms thriving on constant communication. By prioritizing empathetic interactions a nurturing space is created enhancing community sense and reinforcing the trust necessary for sustained engagement. Similarly Kerfoot (2006) emphasizes that authenticity perceived by an audience fundamentally shapes the influence exerted. Thus maintaining consistent and transparent practices that reflect true intentions is crucial for fostering trust and strengthening community bonds.\nThe responsibility of guiding audiences towards more mindful social media engagement is significant. Research by Hsieh and Wang (2015) and Mehmood et al. (2016) shows how authentic leadership can enhance engagement and trust thereby positively influencing behavior. Promoting healthier digital consumption habits encourages interactions that enrich rather than diminish well-being. This form of leadership inspires adopting a mindful approach to digital interactions fostering a healthier and more aware community.\nFurthermore authentic leadership&#x27;s influence extends beyond individual interactions to shape community dynamics. Insights from Qian et al. (2016) and Rego et al. (2013) illustrate how authentic leadership fosters cohesive and supportive group environments. This means cultivating an environment that supports positive social interactions and meaningful community engagement transforming social media spaces into hubs of positive influence and collective well-being.\nCollectively research suggests that applying authentic leadership principles provides a robust framework for navigating the digital space ethically and effectively. By anchoring an online presence in authenticity and leading by example there is a unique opportunity to shape not only perceptions and behaviors but also the broader social dynamics of the digital age. This approach mitigates the potential negative impacts of social media and harnesses its power to foster a more mindful engaged and content society. Through such leadership a legacy of positive change is created demonstrating that even in a digital era dominated by brief interactions authenticity and mindfulness can profoundly influence and improve the collective experience.\nThe Role of Social Media in Enhancing Authentic Leadership\nSocial media plays a significant role in enhancing authentic leadership and fostering societal change. Social media often acts as a powerful tool in enhancing authentic leadership enabling leaders to communicate their authenticity to a broader audience. For instance despite his controversial beliefs and behaviors Donald Trump is often regarded as authentic by his followers due to his direct and unfiltered communication style. His use of Twitter exemplifies how social media can amplify a leader&#x27;s perceived authenticity regardless of the content of their messages. This phenomenon aligns with research by Odii (2020) which discusses how social media allows leaders to reach a broader audience influence public opinion and mobilize followers. Social media\u2019s role in leadership extends beyond mere communication; it fosters a continuous connection between leaders and their audience thereby reinforcing the leader&#x27;s authenticity through transparency and direct engagement.\tBuilding on this Harkins et al. (2023) explore the impact of emotionally charged content on social media in engaging followers and promoting social causes. Their findings suggest that positive emotionally charged images are more effective in garnering social media activity emphasizing the power of social media in leadership and change. This aligns with the principles of authentic leadership where emotional intelligence and engagement are crucial demonstrating how authenticity can translate to success and popularity online.\nKhaund et al. (2022) highlight the influence of social bots and their coordination during online campaigns emphasizing the need for ethical leadership in navigating digital landscapes. Bots can significantly impact social media conversations and public opinion presenting both opportunities and challenges for authentic leaders. The ethical considerations in using social media are critical for maintaining authenticity which in turn affects a leader\u2019s reach and audience.\nNaeem (2020) examines the role of social networking applications in facilitating organizational change by enhancing knowledge sharing and participation. Social media enhances the richness and reach of communication among stakeholders providing a powerful tool for leaders to drive change. This practical application of social media complements the theoretical frameworks of authentic leadership demonstrating how authenticity can enhance a leader\u2019s influence and effectiveness.\nMoreover the impact of social media on leadership reach is profound as demonstrated by Trump\u2019s significant increase in influence through his Twitter presence. Heilweil and Ghaffary (2021) illustrate how Trump\u2019s audience and influence grew substantially a clear demonstration of how social media can amplify a leader\u2019s reach. This expansion of influence is not just about the number of followers but also about the depth of engagement where followers feel a personal connection with the leader due to the perceived authenticity of their communication. However the use of social media in leadership is not without its challenges. As Khaund et al. (2022) highlight the ethical considerations of maintaining authenticity online are significant especially in an environment rife with misinformation. Leaders must navigate these challenges carefully to preserve their authenticity while leveraging the power of social media to expand their influence responsibly.\nConclusion\nThe case of Donald Trump illustrates how social media can amplify a leader&#x27;s perceived authenticity regardless of the content of their messages. Research suggests that authentic leadership and the strategic use of social media are crucial for fostering effective leadership and societal change. As studies indicate social media serves as both an amplifier of perceived authenticity and a platform that requires careful ethical navigation. The strategic use of social media is essential for fostering authentic leadership as it provides leaders with the tools to effectively communicate their authenticity thereby enhancing their influence and impact. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter underscores the dual nature of social media in leadership\u2014offering both opportunities for greater connection and challenges in maintaining authenticity. Future research should explore the long-term effects of these dynamics on societal values and norms.\nCHAPTER 4: Solutions\nThe author\u2019s fiance approaches social media with the skepticism discernment and vigilance of an FBI agent surfing the web. His hyperfocus on evidence facts and supporting information makes it difficult to misinform him. His keen and observant eye can spot inauthenticity from a mile away. Mindfulness is baked into his very nature and so many of the dangers of social media use are mitigated by his skepticism and vigilance regarding external influences.\nNevertheless the influence of social media on societal norms and individual behaviors has reached an unprecedented level in the contemporary digital age. Platforms such as Facebook Instagram Twitter and TikTok have become integral to the daily lives of millions fundamentally altering how individuals communicate receive information and form opinions. As highlighted in Chapter 1 the widespread use of social media with 72% of the U.S. public actively engaging on these platforms underscores its profound impact on social political and community engagement (Auxier &amp; Anderson 2021). However this extensive reach also brings significant risks including the spread of misinformation manipulation of public opinion and the creation of echo chambers that reinforce pre-existing beliefs. These risks were starkly illustrated during the 2016 U.S. presidential election where misinformation campaigns on social media played a pivotal role in shaping voter perceptions and behaviors (Allcott &amp; Gentzkow 2017).\nGiven these concerns the change proposed in this project centers on fostering a more mindful engagement with social media. Mindfulness in this context involves being fully present and aware while interacting with social media content. This approach encourages users to critically evaluate the motives behind the content they encounter and reflect on how it influences their thoughts and actions. The overarching goal is to shift from passive consumption to active thoughtful engagement that prioritizes authenticity truthfulness and constructive dialogue. Such a shift is crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of social media by empowering users to approach content with a critical eye thereby fostering a more informed and discerning public.\nThis change is further emphasized by the social and psychological implications of social media use. Research demonstrates that social media can significantly affect mental health particularly among young users. For instance platforms like Instagram have been shown to contribute to body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem due to the internalization of the thin ideal and appearance comparison tendencies (Fardouly et al. 2015). These findings highlight that social media&#x27;s influence extends beyond public opinion to individual well-being making it imperative to promote a more mindful approach to its use. By encouraging mindfulness this project aims to enhance critical thinking skills and reduce the negative emotional and psychological effects associated with social media aligning with broader goals of promoting mental health and well-being in an increasingly digital world.\nTheoretical Foundation for Mindfulness\nMindfulness traditionally rooted in Eastern philosophical practices has gained significant recognition in psychological and organizational contexts for its benefits in enhancing cognitive and emotional regulation. When applied to social media consumption mindfulness can serve as a powerful tool in resisting the manipulative and often emotionally charged content that proliferates on these platforms. This practice is particularly important in a digital landscape where content is designed to evoke quick reactions often bypassing critical thought.\nThe concept of mindfulness is deeply intertwined with the principles of authentic leadership which emphasizes self-awareness and ethical behavior. Gardner et al. (2005) underscore that self-awareness and self-regulation are fundamental components of authentic leadership\u2014principles that are equally critical when engaging with social media. By fostering self-awareness individuals can better recognize the intent behind social media content and engage with it in a way that aligns with their values and ethical standards. This mindful approach enables users to navigate the digital landscape more effectively where the distinction between authentic and manipulated content is often blurred.\tMindfulness practices also enhance cognitive focus and emotional regulation which are vital in resisting the impulsive reactions that social media content frequently elicits. As Mehmood et al. (2016) found authentic leadership which shares many principles with mindfulness positively influences followers by enhancing their learning orientation and self-regulation. This is particularly relevant in the context of social media where impulsive sharing and emotional reactions can exacerbate the spread of misinformation. Encouraging users to approach social media content mindfully promotes a more deliberate and thoughtful engagement reducing the likelihood of negative outcomes.\tIntegrating mindfulness into social media use also aligns with the broader objectives of promoting ethical behavior and fostering communal well-being as emphasized by authentic leadership principles (Northouse 2019). By cultivating mindfulness users can develop a more critical and reflective approach to social media which not only enhances their own experience but also contributes to a healthier more constructive digital environment. This approach is crucial for countering the negative effects of social media such as polarization and the spread of false information by fostering a more informed and responsible public discourse.\tThe theoretical foundation for promoting mindfulness in social media engagement is well-established. The pervasive influence of social media necessitates a critical approach to its consumption and by integrating mindfulness into social media use this project empowers users to navigate the digital landscape responsibly. Grounded in the principles of mindfulness and authentic leadership this approach emphasizes self-awareness ethical behavior and critical thinking\u2014qualities that are essential for fostering a more informed ethical and constructive digital environment. This change is not only necessary but also timely given the growing concerns about the impact of social media on individual well-being and societal norms.\nDevelopment of a Mindfulness-Oriented Platform\nThe project will initially focus on the development of a website dedicated to fostering mindful social media use. This website serves as a resource hub offering educational materials that promote mindfulness in the consumption of social media. At this stage the website primarily features a curated collection of links to various resources. These resources include articles on the psychological effects of social media guides on achieving authenticity and mindfulness and instructional content on mindfulness exercises specifically tailored for social media users.\tAdditionally the website hosts a selection of social media posts that exemplify mindful engagement. These posts demonstrate how users can maintain authenticity and mindfulness in their interactions online serving as practical examples for visitors to the site.\tWhile the initial launch of the website focuses on these resources plans for future development include the addition of interactive features. A webinar is currently in development aimed at deepening users&#x27; understanding of mindfulness techniques and their application to social media use. This webinar will provide live instruction and the opportunity for participants to engage directly with experts in the field of digital wellness.\nLooking further ahead the website may expand to include a community forum. This forum will provide a space for users to share experiences challenges and strategies related to mindful social media use fostering a supportive online community. The addition of this forum will depend on user engagement and feedback collected during the initial phases of the website&#x27;s operation.\nBy starting with a focus on educational resources and planning for gradual expansion this approach ensures that the platform remains adaptable and responsive to the needs of its users. This phased development strategy will allow the project to build a solid foundation of content and user trust which is essential for fostering a community committed to mindful social media engagement.\nWebsite Measurements\nThe success of the website aimed at promoting mindful engagement with social media will be meticulously assessed through a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. These measurements are designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the website&#x27;s impact and effectiveness enabling ongoing refinements and enhancements.\nQuantitative Measurements\nWebsite analytics will serve as the primary quantitative tool. Utilizing Google Analytics the website will track several indicators including the number of visitors page views and overall engagement rates. This data will offer insights into the reach of the website and the level of interaction users have with the provided content. By analyzing trends over time adjustments can be made to optimize the website&#x27;s layout content and user interface to better meet the needs of the audience. Furthermore these metrics will help determine the most and least popular sections of the website guiding content strategy and development efforts to align with user preferences.\nQualitative Feedback\nIn addition to website analytics qualitative feedback from users will play a crucial role in assessing the website&#x27;s success. Surveys and feedback forms will be integrated directly into the platform making it easy for users to share their experiences and perceptions of the resources offered. This feedback is vital for evaluating the effectiveness of mindfulness practices and educational content in real-world settings. It provides a direct line of communication from users to developers offering insights that might not be captured through analytics alone. The feedback collected will be used to refine and tailor the content ensuring it remains relevant and beneficial for users seeking to improve their mindfulness in social media interactions.\nFeedback from Long-Time Users\n\tRather than conducting long-term studies the website will rely on feedback from long-time users to judge its efficacy. Regular check-ins and surveys targeted at users who have interacted with the site over extended periods will be instrumental in understanding the sustained impact of the mindfulness strategies promoted. This approach will allow the website to gather real-time applicable insights into how the platform influences users&#x27; social media habits over time such as their development in mindful behaviors and changes in their interaction patterns. These insights will be crucial for ongoing content adaptation and resource enhancement to better serve the user base.\nThe website leverages immediate actionable data from analytics and in-depth feedback from users to create a dynamic framework for measuring success. This approach ensures that the website remains responsive to user needs contributing to a more mindful and intentional social media environment. By combining real-time data and user feedback the website cultivates a responsive and user-centric experience fostering a more mindful and intentional social media landscape.\nConclusion\nThe newly developed website is crafted to enhance mindfulness in social media use addressing the extensive impact of digital platforms on mental health and societal norms. It offers a proactive approach to curbing the passive and potentially harmful consumption of social media by providing educational resources on mindfulness techniques and displaying examples of mindful interactions online. This initiative aims to promote a culture of critical engagement and authenticity in digital spaces.\nAs the website continues to evolve it will adapt based on user feedback and engagement metrics to better serve its audience. This effort marks a significant step towards creating a more informed mindful and ethical digital community. Looking ahead the next chapter will review the initial outcomes of the website and propose strategic improvements to further enhance its impact and reach.\n\nCHAPTER 5: Reflections and Recommendations\nProject Summary\nThe author\u2019s fiance can sometimes be fatalistic about the future and often believes in conspiracy theories regarding the past. As a discerning person with a mindset of suspicion he examines any project deeply quickly revealing its flaws and shortcomings. The author\u2019s fiance makes critique an art form\u2014a careful delicate work that begins with observation and research. This project was conceived in a similar manner. The author criticized social media influencers but was fascinated by their reach and ability to impress even the most staunch critic someone much like the author&#x27;s fiance.\nThe goal of this project was to explore the intersection of leadership and social media influence with a particular emphasis on promoting mindful engagement with digital platforms. To achieve this I conducted extensive research that culminated in the creation of a website aimed at serving as a resource for individuals seeking to understand and practice mindful social media use. The website was meticulously designed to bridge the gap between leadership theory and its practical application in the digital age providing insights grounded in established academic research. \nThe science behind the website including its focus on mindful engagement draws from psychological studies that demonstrate how social media can profoundly impact mental health and well-being particularly through mechanisms like social comparison and the internalization of unrealistic standards (Fardouly et al. 2015). In light of these findings the website aims to promote positive and meaningful interactions prioritize authentic connections and provide valuable resources for fostering a healthy online environment. By advocating for balanced and mindful digital consumption the website seeks to empower users to cultivate a more positive relationship with social media and prioritize their mental well-being.\nBy offering a platform where users can learn about the psychological and social impacts of social media the site aspires to guide individuals in navigating the complexities of online influence. This approach is not just theoretical; it is underpinned by the principles of authentic leadership which emphasize the importance of self-awareness ethical behavior and a commitment to the communal good (Gardner et al. 2005). The website serves as a manifestation of these principles offering users tools and strategies to engage with social media in ways that align with their values and promote positive ethical interactions.\nDespite the thoughtful construction and academic grounding of the website the initial reception from friends and family members while positive highlighted a significant limitation: the project\u2019s impact has thus far been confined to a small familiar circle. Their responses which included encouraging remarks like &quot;That&#x27;s cool that you did that&quot; were heartening but also revealed a critical challenge. The website&#x27;s current reach is limited raising concerns about its broader relevance and effectiveness in achieving its intended goals. This issue underscores the importance of not only creating high-quality content but also ensuring that it reaches and resonates with a wider audience. \nReflections\nReflecting on the entirety of this project it is clear that there were both significant achievements and notable challenges. One of the most fulfilling aspects was witnessing the convergence of my past research into a cohesive and practical resource. This process not only reinforced the value of academic inquiry but also demonstrated the potential of applying theoretical knowledge in a real-world context. \nHowever this project also illuminated some critical areas of concern. Chief among them is the realization that without a substantial increase in followership or broader visibility the website may fail to communicate its message effectively. This would mean that the core objective of promoting mindful engagement with social media\u2014and by extension the authentic leadership that should underpin such engagement\u2014might not be realized. The fear of my efforts falling on deaf ears is palpable suggesting that the project as it currently stands could be considered unsuccessful if it does not achieve greater reach.\nThe author conjects that any opportunity for learning comes with an opportunity for growth. As this project began to take shape and the author discovered more and more of the parallels between social media influence and authentic leadership principles and practices she became aware of the insidious ways in which social media was influencing her thoughts and biases. Naturally with a newfound awareness or mindful outset one becomes less susceptible to influence if one does not desire to be influenced and is of a more independent mind.\nThe author has also observed both anecdotally and through supported research (Northouse 2019)  that a fundamental aspect of leadership is the ability to influence others. This influence is significantly bolstered by perceived authenticity with authenticity being most effectively conveyed through genuine behavior (Kerfoot 2006). Therefore anyone aspiring to gain influence as a leader or individual should prioritize self-discovery true self-expression and honest communication (Gardner et al. 2005; Berkovich 2014)\nSuch realization prompted critical self-engagement regarding the author&#x27;s own unmindful social media behaviors leading to the application of researched principles to personal life \u2014 thus making the website a manifestation of this introspective journey. The website aims to offer tools for individuals to emulate this path and cultivate mindfulness and authenticity in their lives.\nThe project&#x27;s strengths lie in its well-researched foundation and the successful creation of a website that has the potential to serve as an educational tool. The process of synthesizing various strands of leadership theory and applying them to the modern digital landscape was intellectually rewarding and provided a solid basis for further work in this area. However the weaknesses are equally apparent. The primary issue is the website&#x27;s limited visibility and the associated risk that its message will not reach the intended audience. This lack of engagement could ultimately undermine the project&#x27;s goals as the impact of a well-crafted message is contingent upon its dissemination.\nMoving forward several steps can be taken to address these challenges and enhance the project&#x27;s effectiveness. First and foremost efforts should be made to increase the website&#x27;s visibility. This could be achieved through a combination of strategies including more aggressive use of social media platforms search engine optimization (SEO) and possibly collaborations with influencers or thought leaders in the field. These actions would help to expand the website&#x27;s reach and attract a broader audience thereby ensuring that the message of mindful engagement does not go unheard.\nAnother important consideration is the scalability of the project. The website has the potential to grow into a more comprehensive platform offering not only static content but also interactive features such as webinars discussion forums and perhaps even online courses. These additions would not only increase user engagement but also provide a richer more immersive experience for those interested in the intersection of leadership and social media influence. Moreover by creating a community around the website it would be possible to foster a sense of shared purpose among users which could further enhance the project&#x27;s impact.\nIn terms of sustainability the project will require ongoing effort and possibly financial investment to maintain and expand its offerings. The development of a subscriber base or the introduction of premium content could provide a revenue stream to support these activities. Additionally continuous feedback from users will be crucial in guiding the evolution of the website ensuring that it remains relevant and responsive to the needs of its audience.\nRecommendations\nFor future research on this topic there are additional avenues that merit consideration. Firstly investigating the long-term effects of social media influencer campaigns on attitudes and behaviors could offer valuable insights into the lasting impact of their influence. Understanding the sustained influence of social media on individuals and society as a whole can help in designing more informed and responsible strategies for leveraging social media for positive change.\nFurthermore exploring the role of emerging social media platforms and technologies in shaping online behavior and influence could provide a fresh perspective. Researching the impact of augmented reality virtual reality and other evolving technologies on social media influence can provide valuable data for understanding and adapting to the changing landscape of online influence.\nAdditionally a comparative analysis of influencer strategies across different cultural and demographic groups could uncover insights into the effectiveness of specific approaches within diverse contexts. Understanding how social media influence varies across cultures and demographics can aid in tailoring strategies for promoting mindful engagement and positive change in a culturally sensitive manner.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion while this project has laid a solid foundation for exploring the relationship between leadership and social media it is clear that more work needs to be done to realize its full potential. By addressing the challenges of visibility and engagement and by scaling the project in a sustainable way there is a strong possibility that the website could become a significant resource for those interested in leadership and mindful social media use. The journey from conception to execution has been both challenging and rewarding and it is my hope that the lessons learned will serve as a valuable guide for future efforts in this field.\n\nReferences\nAllcott H. &amp; Gentzkow M.
