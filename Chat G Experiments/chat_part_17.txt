With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.  Objectives\nshould be achieved within a limited time and be\nidentified with an actual result.  It is\nrecommended that teen court objectives be\nresult-oriented rather than activity-oriented\n(Crowe and Schaefer, 1992; Fulton, Stone, and\nGendreau, 1994).  Some sample goals and\nobjectives may be found in Figure 4-5.\n\nFigure 4-5: Sample Teen Court Program Goals and Objectives\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of youth to become responsible and productive citizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education and hands-on experience in the judicial system.\n\nobjective 1: 90% of youth attending the five-week teen court training seminar will pass a teen court bar\nexam.\n\nobjective 2: All youth volunteers will be scheduled to participate in a teen court trial/hearing within\nthree months of passing their bar examination.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills of youth in the community.\n\nobjective 1: 30% of the ongoing youth volunteer pool will consist of past teen court defendants by the\nend of fiscal year 1996.\n\nobjective 2: 85% of youth volunteers will complete a six-week life skills class during fiscal year 1996.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders accountable.\n\nobjective 1: All referrals to the teen court program will be docketed and heard in teen court within five\nweeks of the referral.\n\nobjective 2: During fiscal year 1996, 80% of teen court defendants will successfully complete their\ncommunity service hours within 90 days of their sentence.\n\nobjective 3: 80% of all restitution payments scheduled to be made during fiscal year 1996 will be\ncollected.\n\nobjective 4: During fiscal year 1996, 60% of teen court defendants will complete a four-week victim\nawareness class.\n\nLong-term goal: Decrease the number of youth in the community engaging in alcohol and illegal drug\nuse.\n\nShort-term goal: Intervene early, provide education to, and promote awareness among youth of the\ndangers of substance abuse.\n\nobjective 1: During fiscal year 1996, 95% of all teen court defendants charged with an alcohol/drug\noffense will attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact panel.\n\nobjective 2: 80% of all teen court defendants will successfully complete a four-week substance abuse\nawareness program.\n\nobjective 3: A pretest and three-month followup test (designed to assess change in knowledge and\nattitude about alcohol and drug use among adolescents) will be administered to all\nparticipants of the substance abuse awareness program. 80% of participants will show a\npositive change in knowledge and attitude relative to alcohol and drug use.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n48 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe establishment of a program\u2019s purpose,\ngoals, and objectives is critical to effective\nprogram implementation and evaluation.\nWithout a carefully considered purpose and\ngoals, the program will lack a clear direction\nand eventually may find its existence called into\nquestion.\n\nThe sample purpose, goals, and objectives\nprovided in this chapter are based on the earlier\n\ndiscussion of the balanced approach mission.\nIndividual teen court programs should develop\nrealistic and achievable goals that reflect the\nprogram\u2019s philosophical basis, jurisdictional\ndifferences, and target population.  Establishing\nreasonable goals and objectives will require\nmore work during the planning and development\nstages to ascertain what improvement rates are\nachievable, given the program aims and\nresources.  However, this investment of time and\neffort should pay off in the long run with a more\neffective program.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 49\n\nCHECKLIST FOR PROGRAM PURPOSE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES\n\nHave teen court program organizers or staff \u2014\n\n\u2751 Developed an understanding of the balanced approach mission and the restorative justice\nmodel?\n\nHoward Zehr (1990, pp. 230-231) developed the following \u201cRestorative Justice Yardstick\u201d as a\nmeans for providing juvenile justice agencies with guidance in moving closer to values and\npolicies consistent with the restorative justice model.

The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.  Objectives\nshould be achieved within a limited time and be\nidentified with an actual result.  It is\nrecommended that teen court objectives be\nresult-oriented rather than activity-oriented\n(Crowe and Schaefer, 1992; Fulton, Stone, and\nGendreau, 1994).  Some sample goals and\nobjectives may be found in Figure 4-5.\n\nFigure 4-5: Sample Teen Court Program Goals and Objectives\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of youth to become responsible and productive citizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education and hands-on experience in the judicial system.\n\nobjective 1: 90% of youth attending the five-week teen court training seminar will pass a teen court bar\nexam.\n\nobjective 2: All youth volunteers will be scheduled to participate in a teen court trial/hearing within\nthree months of passing their bar examination.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills of youth in the community.\n\nobjective 1: 30% of the ongoing youth volunteer pool will consist of past teen court defendants by the\nend of fiscal year 1996.\n\nobjective 2: 85% of youth volunteers will complete a six-week life skills class during fiscal year 1996.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders accountable.\n\nobjective 1: All referrals to the teen court program will be docketed and heard in teen court within five\nweeks of the referral.\n\nobjective 2: During fiscal year 1996, 80% of teen court defendants will successfully complete their\ncommunity service hours within 90 days of their sentence.\n\nobjective 3: 80% of all restitution payments scheduled to be made during fiscal year 1996 will be\ncollected.\n\nobjective 4: During fiscal year 1996, 60% of teen court defendants will complete a four-week victim\nawareness class.\n\nLong-term goal: Decrease the number of youth in the community engaging in alcohol and illegal drug\nuse.\n\nShort-term goal: Intervene early, provide education to, and promote awareness among youth of the\ndangers of substance abuse.\n\nobjective 1: During fiscal year 1996, 95% of all teen court defendants charged with an alcohol/drug\noffense will attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact panel.\n\nobjective 2: 80% of all teen court defendants will successfully complete a four-week substance abuse\nawareness program.\n\nobjective 3: A pretest and three-month followup test (designed to assess change in knowledge and\nattitude about alcohol and drug use among adolescents) will be administered to all\nparticipants of the substance abuse awareness program. 80% of participants will show a\npositive change in knowledge and attitude relative to alcohol and drug use.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n48 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe establishment of a program\u2019s purpose,\ngoals, and objectives is critical to effective\nprogram implementation and evaluation.\nWithout a carefully considered purpose and\ngoals, the program will lack a clear direction\nand eventually may find its existence called into\nquestion.\n\nThe sample purpose, goals, and objectives\nprovided in this chapter are based on the earlier\n\ndiscussion of the balanced approach mission.\nIndividual teen court programs should develop\nrealistic and achievable goals that reflect the\nprogram\u2019s philosophical basis, jurisdictional\ndifferences, and target population.  Establishing\nreasonable goals and objectives will require\nmore work during the planning and development\nstages to ascertain what improvement rates are\nachievable, given the program aims and\nresources.  However, this investment of time and\neffort should pay off in the long run with a more\neffective program.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 49\n\nCHECKLIST FOR PROGRAM PURPOSE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES\n\nHave teen court program organizers or staff \u2014\n\n\u2751 Developed an understanding of the balanced approach mission and the restorative justice\nmodel?\n\nHoward Zehr (1990, pp. 230-231) developed the following \u201cRestorative Justice Yardstick\u201d as a\nmeans for providing juvenile justice agencies with guidance in moving closer to values and\npolicies consistent with the restorative justice model.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.  Objectives\nshould be achieved within a limited time and be\nidentified with an actual result.  It is\nrecommended that teen court objectives be\nresult-oriented rather than activity-oriented\n(Crowe and Schaefer, 1992; Fulton, Stone, and\nGendreau, 1994).  Some sample goals and\nobjectives may be found in Figure 4-5.\n\nFigure 4-5: Sample Teen Court Program Goals and Objectives\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of youth to become responsible and productive citizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education and hands-on experience in the judicial system.\n\nobjective 1: 90% of youth attending the five-week teen court training seminar will pass a teen court bar\nexam.\n\nobjective 2: All youth volunteers will be scheduled to participate in a teen court trial/hearing within\nthree months of passing their bar examination.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills of youth in the community.\n\nobjective 1: 30% of the ongoing youth volunteer pool will consist of past teen court defendants by the\nend of fiscal year 1996.\n\nobjective 2: 85% of youth volunteers will complete a six-week life skills class during fiscal year 1996.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders accountable.\n\nobjective 1: All referrals to the teen court program will be docketed and heard in teen court within five\nweeks of the referral.\n\nobjective 2: During fiscal year 1996, 80% of teen court defendants will successfully complete their\ncommunity service hours within 90 days of their sentence.\n\nobjective 3: 80% of all restitution payments scheduled to be made during fiscal year 1996 will be\ncollected.\n\nobjective 4: During fiscal year 1996, 60% of teen court defendants will complete a four-week victim\nawareness class.\n\nLong-term goal: Decrease the number of youth in the community engaging in alcohol and illegal drug\nuse.\n\nShort-term goal: Intervene early, provide education to, and promote awareness among youth of the\ndangers of substance abuse.\n\nobjective 1: During fiscal year 1996, 95% of all teen court defendants charged with an alcohol/drug\noffense will attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact panel.\n\nobjective 2: 80% of all teen court defendants will successfully complete a four-week substance abuse\nawareness program.\n\nobjective 3: A pretest and three-month followup test (designed to assess change in knowledge and\nattitude about alcohol and drug use among adolescents) will be administered to all\nparticipants of the substance abuse awareness program. 80% of participants will show a\npositive change in knowledge and attitude relative to alcohol and drug use.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n48 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe establishment of a program\u2019s purpose,\ngoals, and objectives is critical to effective\nprogram implementation and evaluation.\nWithout a carefully considered purpose and\ngoals, the program will lack a clear direction\nand eventually may find its existence called into\nquestion.\n\nThe sample purpose, goals, and objectives\nprovided in this chapter are based on the earlier\n\ndiscussion of the balanced approach mission.\nIndividual teen court programs should develop\nrealistic and achievable goals that reflect the\nprogram\u2019s philosophical basis, jurisdictional\ndifferences, and target population.  Establishing\nreasonable goals and objectives will require\nmore work during the planning and development\nstages to ascertain what improvement rates are\nachievable, given the program aims and\nresources.  However, this investment of time and\neffort should pay off in the long run with a more\neffective program.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 49\n\nCHECKLIST FOR PROGRAM PURPOSE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES\n\nHave teen court program organizers or staff \u2014\n\n\u2751 Developed an understanding of the balanced approach mission and the restorative justice\nmodel?\n\nHoward Zehr (1990, pp. 230-231) developed the following \u201cRestorative Justice Yardstick\u201d as a\nmeans for providing juvenile justice agencies with guidance in moving closer to values and\npolicies consistent with the restorative justice model.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.  Objectives\nshould be achieved within a limited time and be\nidentified with an actual result.  It is\nrecommended that teen court objectives be\nresult-oriented rather than activity-oriented\n(Crowe and Schaefer, 1992; Fulton, Stone, and\nGendreau, 1994).  Some sample goals and\nobjectives may be found in Figure 4-5.\n\nFigure 4-5: Sample Teen Court Program Goals and Objectives\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of youth to become responsible and productive citizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education and hands-on experience in the judicial system.\n\nobjective 1: 90% of youth attending the five-week teen court training seminar will pass a teen court bar\nexam.\n\nobjective 2: All youth volunteers will be scheduled to participate in a teen court trial/hearing within\nthree months of passing their bar examination.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills of youth in the community.\n\nobjective 1: 30% of the ongoing youth volunteer pool will consist of past teen court defendants by the\nend of fiscal year 1996.\n\nobjective 2: 85% of youth volunteers will complete a six-week life skills class during fiscal year 1996.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders accountable.\n\nobjective 1: All referrals to the teen court program will be docketed and heard in teen court within five\nweeks of the referral.\n\nobjective 2: During fiscal year 1996, 80% of teen court defendants will successfully complete their\ncommunity service hours within 90 days of their sentence.\n\nobjective 3: 80% of all restitution payments scheduled to be made during fiscal year 1996 will be\ncollected.\n\nobjective 4: During fiscal year 1996, 60% of teen court defendants will complete a four-week victim\nawareness class.\n\nLong-term goal: Decrease the number of youth in the community engaging in alcohol and illegal drug\nuse.\n\nShort-term goal: Intervene early, provide education to, and promote awareness among youth of the\ndangers of substance abuse.\n\nobjective 1: During fiscal year 1996, 95% of all teen court defendants charged with an alcohol/drug\noffense will attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact panel.\n\nobjective 2: 80% of all teen court defendants will successfully complete a four-week substance abuse\nawareness program.\n\nobjective 3: A pretest and three-month followup test (designed to assess change in knowledge and\nattitude about alcohol and drug use among adolescents) will be administered to all\nparticipants of the substance abuse awareness program. 80% of participants will show a\npositive change in knowledge and attitude relative to alcohol and drug use.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n48 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe establishment of a program\u2019s purpose,\ngoals, and objectives is critical to effective\nprogram implementation and evaluation.\nWithout a carefully considered purpose and\ngoals, the program will lack a clear direction\nand eventually may find its existence called into\nquestion.\n\nThe sample purpose, goals, and objectives\nprovided in this chapter are based on the earlier\n\ndiscussion of the balanced approach mission.\nIndividual teen court programs should develop\nrealistic and achievable goals that reflect the\nprogram\u2019s philosophical basis, jurisdictional\ndifferences, and target population.  Establishing\nreasonable goals and objectives will require\nmore work during the planning and development\nstages to ascertain what improvement rates are\nachievable, given the program aims and\nresources.  However, this investment of time and\neffort should pay off in the long run with a more\neffective program.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 49\n\nCHECKLIST FOR PROGRAM PURPOSE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES\n\nHave teen court program organizers or staff \u2014\n\n\u2751 Developed an understanding of the balanced approach mission and the restorative justice\nmodel?\n\nHoward Zehr (1990, pp. 230-231) developed the following \u201cRestorative Justice Yardstick\u201d as a\nmeans for providing juvenile justice agencies with guidance in moving closer to values and\npolicies consistent with the restorative justice model.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.  Objectives\nshould be achieved within a limited time and be\nidentified with an actual result.  It is\nrecommended that teen court objectives be\nresult-oriented rather than activity-oriented\n(Crowe and Schaefer, 1992; Fulton, Stone, and\nGendreau, 1994).  Some sample goals and\nobjectives may be found in Figure 4-5.\n\nFigure 4-5: Sample Teen Court Program Goals and Objectives\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of youth to become responsible and productive citizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education and hands-on experience in the judicial system.\n\nobjective 1: 90% of youth attending the five-week teen court training seminar will pass a teen court bar\nexam.\n\nobjective 2: All youth volunteers will be scheduled to participate in a teen court trial/hearing within\nthree months of passing their bar examination.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills of youth in the community.\n\nobjective 1: 30% of the ongoing youth volunteer pool will consist of past teen court defendants by the\nend of fiscal year 1996.\n\nobjective 2: 85% of youth volunteers will complete a six-week life skills class during fiscal year 1996.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders accountable.\n\nobjective 1: All referrals to the teen court program will be docketed and heard in teen court within five\nweeks of the referral.\n\nobjective 2: During fiscal year 1996, 80% of teen court defendants will successfully complete their\ncommunity service hours within 90 days of their sentence.\n\nobjective 3: 80% of all restitution payments scheduled to be made during fiscal year 1996 will be\ncollected.\n\nobjective 4: During fiscal year 1996, 60% of teen court defendants will complete a four-week victim\nawareness class.\n\nLong-term goal: Decrease the number of youth in the community engaging in alcohol and illegal drug\nuse.\n\nShort-term goal: Intervene early, provide education to, and promote awareness among youth of the\ndangers of substance abuse.\n\nobjective 1: During fiscal year 1996, 95% of all teen court defendants charged with an alcohol/drug\noffense will attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact panel.\n\nobjective 2: 80% of all teen court defendants will successfully complete a four-week substance abuse\nawareness program.\n\nobjective 3: A pretest and three-month followup test (designed to assess change in knowledge and\nattitude about alcohol and drug use among adolescents) will be administered to all\nparticipants of the substance abuse awareness program. 80% of participants will show a\npositive change in knowledge and attitude relative to alcohol and drug use.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n48 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe establishment of a program\u2019s purpose,\ngoals, and objectives is critical to effective\nprogram implementation and evaluation.\nWithout a carefully considered purpose and\ngoals, the program will lack a clear direction\nand eventually may find its existence called into\nquestion.\n\nThe sample purpose, goals, and objectives\nprovided in this chapter are based on the earlier\n\ndiscussion of the balanced approach mission.\nIndividual teen court programs should develop\nrealistic and achievable goals that reflect the\nprogram\u2019s philosophical basis, jurisdictional\ndifferences, and target population.  Establishing\nreasonable goals and objectives will require\nmore work during the planning and development\nstages to ascertain what improvement rates are\nachievable, given the program aims and\nresources.  However, this investment of time and\neffort should pay off in the long run with a more\neffective program.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 49\n\nCHECKLIST FOR PROGRAM PURPOSE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES\n\nHave teen court program organizers or staff \u2014\n\n\u2751 Developed an understanding of the balanced approach mission and the restorative justice\nmodel?\n\nHoward Zehr (1990, pp. 230-231) developed the following \u201cRestorative Justice Yardstick\u201d as a\nmeans for providing juvenile justice agencies with guidance in moving closer to values and\npolicies consistent with the restorative justice model.

With this increasing awareness will come\nincreasing scrutiny, as programs are asked to\nprove their effectiveness while vying for limited\nresources.  It is, therefore, essential that\nprograms identify their purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  The purpose of a program provides\nthe framework that sets the direction of the\nprogram, while the goals and objectives provide\na plan as to how the purpose will be achieved.\n\nIn addition, the program purpose and goals are\nthe foundation upon which other program\nelements are defined, such as the target\npopulation and program services.  Measurable\nobjectives will provide programs with a\nmechanism for evaluating their results.  Target\npopulation, program services, and program\nevaluation will be discussed in greater detail in\nsubsequent chapters, but they are mentioned\nhere in order to draw attention to the\ninterdependency of the steps and decisions in the\nprogram development process.\n\nWhen developing a program\u2019s purpose, goals,\nand objectives, it may be helpful to understand\nthe rationale and philosophy behind teen court\nprograms.  This chapter begins with a discussion\nof some of the recurring themes among teen\ncourt programs and concludes with practical\ninformation on developing a purpose, goals, and\nobjectives for a teen court program.\nSpecifically, by the end of this chapter, readers\nwill be able to\n\ndiscuss the concept behind the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice\nmodel and explain its relation to goals of teen\ncourt programs;\n\ndevelop a purpose statement for a teen court\nprogram; and\n\ndevelop short- and long-term goals and\nmeasurable objectives for a teen court\nprogram.\n\nTHE BALANCED APPROACH\nMISSION AND RESTORATIVE\nJUSTICE MODEL\n\nOne of the emerging trends in juvenile justice is\nbased on the concept known as the balanced\napproach mission and restorative justice model.\nIn an attempt to provide equal attention to\noffenders, victims and the community, the\nbalanced approach mission, according to\nBazemore and Umbreit (1994), focuses on\n\naccountability;\n\ncompetency development; and\n\ncommunity protection.\n\nThe philosophy of restorative justice is based on\nthe following values and assumptions\n(McLagan, 1992, as cited in Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994):\n\nOffenders, victims, and the community\nshould be included in the response to crime.\n\nGovernment and local communities should\nassume complementary roles in responding\nto crime.\n\nAccountability is based on offenders\nunderstanding the harm caused by their\nactions, accepting responsibility for the harm\ncaused, and making amends.\n\nIt is through values espoused within this type of\nframework that goals of the balanced approach\nmission take on a more significant meaning\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994). What is\ninteresting to note is that these same goals (i.e.,\naccountability, competency development,\ncommunity protection) recur throughout the\nliterature and program materials from teen court\nprograms.  Although they tout goals similar to\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n42 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nthose found in the balanced approach mission,\nthe majority of teen court programs, like many\nother juvenile justice agencies, have not\nimplemented the elements inherent in this\npromising approach to their full potential.\nPrograms that follow a balanced and restorative\njustice model provide a means for reconciling\nthe interests of and meeting the mutual needs of\nvictims, offenders, and the community\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).\n\nImplementing programs based on the balanced\nand restorative justice model can be an ominous\ntask and often requires agencies to adopt a new\nway of viewing the roles of offenders, victims,\nand the community in the justice process\n(Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  With\nconsideration and active participation from other\njuvenile justice agencies, victims, and the\ncommunity, teen court programs can offer\njurisdictions an avenue to bring the philosophy\nof the balanced approach mission in juvenile\njustice into actual practice.\n\nAccountability\nOften society has difficulty determining where\nto affix the culpability for juvenile crime.\nResponsibility has been placed on parents,\nschools, the community, or the court system.\nAlthough each contributes to the problems that\nlead to juvenile crime, the individual\nresponsibility of the youthful offender cannot be\nignored.   Families, schools, communities, and\nthe juvenile justice system all must play a role in\nensuring that youth accept responsibility and are\nheld accountable for their actions.\n\nUnder the balanced approach mission,\naccountability refers to the need for offenders to\nmake amends to victims for the losses caused by\ntheir delinquent actions.  This entails not only\nthe action of making amends through avenues\nsuch as community service or restitution, but\nalso entails creating an awareness in youthful\noffenders of the harmful consequences their\nactions have on others, most notably victims\n(Bazemore, 1993).  In cases coming before a\n\nteen court program in which there is no\nidentifiable victim, the message still should be\nsent to teen court defendants that their actions do\naffect others, including their families and the\ncommunity as a whole.\n\nWhat is missing in many teen court\nprograms, however, is the link for\noffenders between the act of making\namends and the awareness and\nunderstanding of why it is necessary to\nmake amends.\n\nMost teen court programs require youthful\noffenders to redress victims and the community\nfor the harm caused through the provision of\ncommunity service and, in some programs,\nthrough oral or written apologies to victims and\nmonetary restitution (American Probation and\nParole Association, 1994).  What is missing in\nmany teen court programs, however, is the link\nfor offenders between the act of making amends\nand the awareness and understanding of why it is\nnecessary to make amends.  In its Report and\nRecommendations to Victims of Juvenile Crime,\nthe American Correctional Association Victims\nCommittee (1994, p.6) states: \u201cIn far too many\ncases, juvenile offenders leave the scene of their\ncrimes without any inclination of the serious\neffects of their acts or the devastating impact\ntheir crimes have on their victims.\u201d  Therefore,\nif a teen court program is to operationalize the\ngoal of accountability to its fullest extent, it\nmust not only create opportunities for youth to\nrepay victims and the community, it also must\nbuild in an awareness component that educates\nyouth on the impact their actions have on others,\n(i.e., victims and community).\n\nIn doing this, efforts should be made to involve\nthe community and victims actively in the\nprocess (Bazemore and Umbreit, 1994).  The\ncommunity plays significant roles in holding\noffenders accountable by providing locations for\noffenders to complete community service hours\nand by providing offenders with paid work\nopportunities, increasing their ability to pay\nrestitution.  At a minimum, victims should\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 43\n\nprovide impact information (written or oral) on\nhow the crime affected them.  This information\ncan be used during the sentencing phase to\nprovide jurors with information to assist them in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence and to\nbegin the process of personalizing the crime for\nthe offender.\n\nCompetency Development\nUnder the balanced approach mission, the\ncompetency development goal emphasizes the\nneed for offenders to leave the juvenile justice\nsystem with skills that will enable them to be\nproductive participants in society (Bazemore\nand Umbreit, 1994).  Additionally, Norem-\nHebeisen and Hedin (1981) stress that to\ndecrease delinquency, one goal of peer\nprograms should be to provide at-risk youth\nwith skills that aid them when they find\nthemselves in situations in which problem\nbehavior is encouraged and supported.  Teen\ncourt programs can be effective in this area by\nteaching youth (i.e., youthful offenders and\ncommunity youth) necessary life and coping\nskills and then offering a meaningful forum in\nwhich to use and refine those skills.\n\nThe goal is for young people to carry\nover and apply what they learn through\nteen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their\nlives.\n\nThroughout their participation in the program,\nteen court defendants and youth volunteers will\nbe confronted by persons with differing\nviewpoints and backgrounds, which often\nmirror experiences and situations encountered in\nother aspects of their lives.  At times, these\ndifferences may cause frustration; however, the\nway youth learn to react and respond to these\ndiffering viewpoints and personalities is all part\nof the learning process.  The goal is for young\npeople to carry over and apply what they learn\nthrough teen court when confronted with other\ndifficult choices and situations in their lives.\n\nMost teen court programs are designed to\nintervene early (usually after a first offense) in\nthe delinquent behavior of a juvenile.  Some\nways in which teen court programs offer skill-\nbuilding opportunities for youthful offenders is\nthrough requiring the performance of\ncommunity service and participation in\neducational workshops.  In addition to holding\nyouth accountable, basic habits that the\nperformance of community service can instill in\nyouth include (Maloney and Bazemore, 1994)\n\nreporting to work on time;\n\ncooperating with coworkers;\n\naccepting constructive criticism; and\n\nsuccessfully finishing a task.\n\nEducational workshops can be designed and\noffered to defendants to assist them in\ndeveloping needed skills in specific areas, such\nas managing conflict and problem solving.  As a\nmeans to further the development, enhancement,\nand application of life skills, most teen court\nprograms require or encourage offenders to\nparticipate as a volunteer in the program, usually\nin the role of a juror.  The table is turned, and the\ndelinquent youth is offered an opportunity to\nexperience the other side of the justice system\nby determining consequences for a peer.  Staff,\nwho observe a youth\u2019s interaction with other\njurors and teen court participants, can identify\nyouth who are lacking in certain skill areas and\nwho may need additional assistance or an\ninformal referral for other services.\n\nTeen court is not a mock trial; the cases that are\nheard are real.  As a prevention program, teen\ncourt programs offer youth in the community\nvaluable education and hands-on experience in\nthe legal and judicial system.   This places youth\nvolunteers in positions that require a tremendous\namount of responsibility.  They assume roles\nthat give them the power to make decisions that\ncan have a direct impact on the lives of the teen\ncourt defendants.  Through these roles, young\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n44 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\nPrevention (1993) based a major component of\nits Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent,\nand Chronic Juvenile Offenders on the premise\nthat to effectively handle delinquent behavior,\nthere must to be a range of graduated sanctions\nand a full continuum of treatment and\nrehabilitative services.  Aside from assisting\ncommunity youth to develop needed skills to\nresist the pressures to participate in illegal\nactivity, teen court programs promote public\nsafety by offering jurisdictions an alternative\nprogram to juvenile court for nonviolent,\nmisdemeanor cases.  The rationale for doing so\nis that the number of cases being heard in\njuvenile court will decrease, and more time will\nbe allotted for juvenile court to hear more\nserious cases.\n\nSAMPLE STATEMENTS OF\nPURPOSE, GOALS, AND\nOBJECTIVES\n\nAfter considering the philosophy and rationale\nbehind teen courts, program developers need to\ntranslate the philosophy into practice.  Each\n\npeople can play an active part in addressing the\nproblem of juvenile delinquency within their\ncommunity.\n\nCommunity Protection\nThe right of the public to a safe and secure\ncommunity is at the heart of all justice programs\nin both the adult and juvenile systems.  As a\nmeans to help ensure public safety, the balanced\napproach mission calls for a shared\nresponsibility between the juvenile justice\nsystem and the community for the control and\nreintegration of offenders (Bazemore and\nUmbreit, 1994).  By helping youth develop and\nenhance needed life and coping skills and\neducating them on the legal and judicial system,\nteen court programs can cause youth to adopt\nmore prosocial attitudes, which ultimately can\nhelp protect the community.\n\nThis concept is illustrated by the personal\nstatement in Figure 4-1.  It was written by a 15-\nyear-old girl who, before her involvement as a\nvolunteer in the Buncombe County Teen Court\nProgram in Asheville, North Carolina, had\ndeveloped a pattern of shoplifting.  She was\nnever caught.\n\nFigure 4-1: Personal Statement of a Youth Teen Court Volunteer\n\nA few years ago I started hanging out with some guys that always got into trouble with the police. I knew\nwhat they were doing was wrong, but I didn\u2019t know exactly what would happen if we were caught. It\ndidn\u2019t take long for me to get used to their ways and fit in well. When we would go into a store, I always\nknew my part, and no one else ever messed up either. We never got caught, and after a while we all got\nvery cocky about things.\n\nThere was one time when we went into a store five times in a row, and the last two times there was a\npolice officer in there. It didn\u2019t bother us; we just tried to get as much as we could and if we got caught,\nwell, really we thought that the police were too stupid to catch us. The way we thought was an ignorant\nway of thinking, because a week after that my friends were caught at another store, I, fortunately, was not\nwith them, but it got me to thinking. What if I had been with them? If I had been caught, what would have\nhappened? Even though it got me thinking, I didn\u2019t quit doing those types of things. I still wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat could happen if I was caught.\n\nOnce teen court started in Asheville, I got into it. I learned about what could have happened if I was\ncaught, and that was when I decided not to do anything illegal again. If it hadn\u2019t been for teen court, I\nwould never have learned about the consequences of doing wrong things and I would probably still be\ndoing them.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 45\n\njurisdiction should consider the philosophy\nwithin the context of its own community needs\nand resources.  Blindly implementing a program\nbased on its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution that\nultimately may prove ineffective (Cochran,\n1989).\n\nBlindly implementing a program based\non its apparent success in other\njurisdictions is a simplistic solution\nthat ultimately may prove ineffective\n(Cochran, 1989).\n\nIt is advisable to include agency staff and\nstakeholders of the program (those who are\nsupportive of the program\u2019s efforts as well as\nthose who may be resistant) in the process of\ndeveloping the purpose, goals, and objectives.  If\na program is being developed within an existing\nagency, the program purpose must be in\naccordance with all other aspects of the\noverseeing agency\u2019s mission and must be\nacceptable to all involved with the program.\nAccording to Crowe and Schaefer (1992), some\nissues that may need to be evaluated by program\ndevelopers in this process include\n\nthe overall mission of the agency\nimplementing the program;\n\nlegal issues that may affect the program; and\n\nlimitations of community and program\nresources.\n\nThe following section outlines the process of\ndeveloping a program\u2019s purpose, goals, and\nobjectives.  When possible, examples used\nreflect concepts related to the earlier discussion\nof the balanced approach mission and restorative\njustice model.\n\nProgram Purpose\nA teen court program\u2019s viability depends on its\nability to address a pressing local problem.  It is\ncrucial that a teen court program focus on needs\nwithin its jurisdiction that can be addressed\n\nrealistically.  This will enable agencies to\ndevelop manageable, effective programs.  The\nfollowing two primary questions can help\nprogram developers limit the scope of a program\nto something that is realistic and achievable\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994):\n\nWhat deficiencies are we trying to\novercome?\n\nWhich ones can we realistically overcome\ngiven the existing resources and level of\nsupport?\n\nA clearly articulated statement identifying the\nprimary purpose of the program will assist\nagencies in remaining focused on achievable and\ncongruent goals.  The purpose statement for any\nprogram, like an agency mission statement,\nshould clearly state the primary purpose of the\nprogram and the population for whom it is\ndesigned.  It also should include a very brief and\ngeneral description of the services it will provide\n(Fulton, Stone, and Gendreau, 1994).  A sample\nteen court purpose statement may be found in\nFigure 4-2.\n\nFigure 4-2: Sample Teen Court Program Purpose\nStatement\n\nThe Teen Court Program is a community-\nbased intervention/prevention program\ndesigned to provide an alternative response for\nthe juvenile justice system for first-time,\nnonviolent, misdemeanor juvenile offenders,\nin which community youth determine the\nappropriate sanctions for the offender. The\nprogram will hold youthful offenders\naccountable and provide educational services\nto offenders and youth volunteers in an effort\nto promote long-term behavioral change that\nleads to enhanced public safety.\n\nProgram Goals\nProgram goals are broad, general statements that\nserve to map out the future and provide a\nmeasure of success in achieving the program\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n46 American Probation and Parole Association\n\npurpose.  They should clarify the intentions of\nthe program and direct program activities.  It is\nrecommended that agencies apply the following\nguidelines when developing goals for teen court\nprograms:\n\nFocus the goals according to the target\npopulation and program services provided.\n\nCarefully select the goals of a teen court\nprogram based on prioritized needs and\navailable resources.\n\nDifferentiate short- and long-term goals.\n\nA further discussion of these guidelines reveals\nhow their application can enhance the credibility\nof teen court programs.\n\nFocusing on Target Population and Services\nto Be Provided\nWhen developing goals, program developers\nshould keep in mind the target population the\nprogram is designed to serve.  If a program\ndecides to target first-time offenders, the goals\nand objectives of the program may differ from\nthose of programs targeting repeat offenders\nwho may need more intensive services.  Target\npopulation and program services are discussed\nin more detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nBasing Goals on Prioritized Needs and\nAvailable Resources\nStakeholder desires and jurisdictional needs\nshould not be ignored.  However, agencies must\nexamine and prioritize these needs.  This\nrequires an examination of the needs of youth in\nthe community and a determination of which\nneeds are not currently being met through other\nmeans and could be met through teen court.\nFunding and community resources need to be\nexamined to ascertain if the identified needs can\nbe met with existing resources or if the\ndevelopment of resources is feasible.  Realistic\ngoals that address a specific and important need\nthen can be established. (See Figure 4-3.)\n\nFigure 4-3: Sample Teen Court Program Goals -\nBased on a Prioritized Need\n\nPrioritized Need: A program to address the\nproblem of underage drinking and illegal drug\nuse in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: To decrease the number of\nyouth in the community\nengaging in alcohol and\nillegal drug use.\n\nShort-term goal: To intervene early, provide\neducation to, and promote\nawareness among youth of\nthe dangers of substance\nabuse.\n\nDifferentiating Between Short- and Long-\nTerm Goals\nProgram developers may find it helpful to\ndifferentiate between short- and long-term goals\nof the teen court program.  Some goals may\nhave a rehabilitative focus associated with long-\nterm behavior change. These may be easier to\nevaluate if refocused and broken down into\nshort-term goals that support the long-term goal.\nAlso, it may be easier to sustain internal and\nexternal program support if people can see goals\nbeing achieved in the short-term.  Figure 4-4\nprovides an example.\n\nFigure 4-4: Sample Teen Court Program Long- and\nShort-Term Goals\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of\nyouth to become\nresponsible and productive\ncitizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education\nand hands-on experience in\nthe judical systems.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills\nof youth in the community.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders\naccountable.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 47\n\nProgram Objectives\nObjectives are crucial to effective program\nimplementation and evaluation.  Program\nobjectives specify how program goals will be\nachieved and should include a method for\nevaluating results.  While program goals should\nclearly state the intentions of a program,\nobjectives should describe the mechanisms and\nstrategies used to accomplish those intentions.\n\nSpecific and measurable objectives should be\nassigned to each major goal area.  Objectives\nshould be achieved within a limited time and be\nidentified with an actual result.  It is\nrecommended that teen court objectives be\nresult-oriented rather than activity-oriented\n(Crowe and Schaefer, 1992; Fulton, Stone, and\nGendreau, 1994).  Some sample goals and\nobjectives may be found in Figure 4-5.\n\nFigure 4-5: Sample Teen Court Program Goals and Objectives\n\nLong-term goal: Improve the capacity of youth to become responsible and productive citizens.\n\nShort-term goal: Provide youth with education and hands-on experience in the judicial system.\n\nobjective 1: 90% of youth attending the five-week teen court training seminar will pass a teen court bar\nexam.\n\nobjective 2: All youth volunteers will be scheduled to participate in a teen court trial/hearing within\nthree months of passing their bar examination.\n\nShort-term goal: Increase life and coping skills of youth in the community.\n\nobjective 1: 30% of the ongoing youth volunteer pool will consist of past teen court defendants by the\nend of fiscal year 1996.\n\nobjective 2: 85% of youth volunteers will complete a six-week life skills class during fiscal year 1996.\n\nLong-term goal: Protect the community.\n\nShort-term goal: Hold youthful offenders accountable.\n\nobjective 1: All referrals to the teen court program will be docketed and heard in teen court within five\nweeks of the referral.\n\nobjective 2: During fiscal year 1996, 80% of teen court defendants will successfully complete their\ncommunity service hours within 90 days of their sentence.\n\nobjective 3: 80% of all restitution payments scheduled to be made during fiscal year 1996 will be\ncollected.\n\nobjective 4: During fiscal year 1996, 60% of teen court defendants will complete a four-week victim\nawareness class.\n\nLong-term goal: Decrease the number of youth in the community engaging in alcohol and illegal drug\nuse.\n\nShort-term goal: Intervene early, provide education to, and promote awareness among youth of the\ndangers of substance abuse.\n\nobjective 1: During fiscal year 1996, 95% of all teen court defendants charged with an alcohol/drug\noffense will attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact panel.\n\nobjective 2: 80% of all teen court defendants will successfully complete a four-week substance abuse\nawareness program.\n\nobjective 3: A pretest and three-month followup test (designed to assess change in knowledge and\nattitude about alcohol and drug use among adolescents) will be administered to all\nparticipants of the substance abuse awareness program. 80% of participants will show a\npositive change in knowledge and attitude relative to alcohol and drug use.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\n48 American Probation and Parole Association\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe establishment of a program\u2019s purpose,\ngoals, and objectives is critical to effective\nprogram implementation and evaluation.\nWithout a carefully considered purpose and\ngoals, the program will lack a clear direction\nand eventually may find its existence called into\nquestion.\n\nThe sample purpose, goals, and objectives\nprovided in this chapter are based on the earlier\n\ndiscussion of the balanced approach mission.\nIndividual teen court programs should develop\nrealistic and achievable goals that reflect the\nprogram\u2019s philosophical basis, jurisdictional\ndifferences, and target population.  Establishing\nreasonable goals and objectives will require\nmore work during the planning and development\nstages to ascertain what improvement rates are\nachievable, given the program aims and\nresources.  However, this investment of time and\neffort should pay off in the long run with a more\neffective program.\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Peer Justice and Youth Empowerment: An Implementation Guide for Teen Court Programs\n\nAmerican Probation and Parole Association 49\n\nCHECKLIST FOR PROGRAM PURPOSE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES\n\nHave teen court program organizers or staff \u2014\n\n\u2751 Developed an understanding of the balanced approach mission and the restorative justice\nmodel?\n\nHoward Zehr (1990, pp. 230-231) developed the following \u201cRestorative Justice Yardstick\u201d as a\nmeans for providing juvenile justice agencies with guidance in moving closer to values and\npolicies consistent with the restorative justice model.

In particular, healthcare workers experience high rates of mental ill health such as burnout, stress, and depression due to workplace conditions including excessive workloads, workplace violence and bullying, which also produces negative effects on patients as well as on the happiness and wellbeing of those who remain at work. This review was undertaken to synthesize the evidence on workplace-based interventions at the organizational level promoting mental health and wellbeing among healthcare workers, to identify what has been receiving attention in this area and why, especially considering how such positive effects are produced. A search of three premier health-related databases identified 1290 articles that discussed healthcare workers, workplace interventions, and mental health. Following further examination, 46 articles were ultimately selected as meeting the criteria specifying interventions at the organizational level and combined with similar studies included in a relevant Cochrane review. The 60 chosen articles were then analyzed following a realist framework analyzing context, mechanism, and outcome. Most of the studies included in the realist review were conducted in high-income countries, and the types of organizational-level interventions studied included skills and knowledge development, leadership development, communication and team building, stress management as well as workload and time management. Common themes from the realist review highlight the importance of employee engagement in the intervention development and implementation process. The literature review also supports the recognized need for more research on mental health and happiness in low- and middle-income countries, and for studies evaluating the longer-term effects of workplace mental health promotion.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;P.

The absence of adequate and quality mental health infrastructure and workforce is increasingly recognized. The ethical implications of inequalities in mental health for people and nations are profound and must be addressed in efforts to fulfil key bioethics principles of medicine and public health: respect for individuals, justice, beneficence, and non-malfeasance. Stigma and discrimination against people living with mental disorders affects their education, employment, access to care and hampers their capacity to contribute to society. Mental health well-being is closely associated to several Millennium Development Goals and economic development sectors including education, labour force participation, and productivity. Limited access to mental health care increases patient and family suffering. Unmet mental health needs have a negative effect on poverty reduction initiatives and economic development. Untreated mental conditions contribute to economic loss because they increase school and work absenteeism and dropout rates, healthcare expenditure, and unemployment. Addressing unmet mental health needs will require development of better mental health infrastructure and workforce and overall integration of mental and physical health services with primary care, especially in the developing nations.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;E.

Our explanations fall into three categories: (1) work and economic conditions, (2) social-psychological resources, and (3) health lifestyle. We replicate analyses with two samples, cross-sectionally and over time, using two health measures (self-reported health and physical functioning). The first data set comes from a national probability sample of U.S. households in which respondents were interviewed by telephone in 1990 (2,031 respondents, ages 18 to 90). The second data set comes from a national probability sample of U.S. households in which respondents ages 20 to 64 were interviewed by telephone first in 1979 (3,025 respondents), and then again in 1980 (2,436 respondents). Results demonstrate a positive association between education and health and help explain why the association exists. (1) Compared to the poorly educated, well educated respondents are less likely to be unemployed, are more likely to work full-time, to have fulfilling, subjectively rewarding jobs, high incomes, and low economic hardship. Full-time work, fulfilling work, high income, and low economic hardship in turn significantly improve health in all analyses. (2) The well educated report a greater sense of control over their lives and their health, and they have higher levels of social support. The sense of control, and to a lesser extent support, are associated with good health. (3) The well educated are less likely to smoke, are more likely to exercise, to get health check-ups, and to drink moderately, all of which, except check-ups, are associated with good health. We conclude that high educational attainment improves health directly, and it improves health indirectly through work and economic conditions, social-psychological resources, and health lifestyle. he positive association between education and health is well established, but explanations for this association are not. Well educated people experience better health than the poorly educated, as indicated by high levels of self-reported health and physical functioning and low levels of morbidity, mortality, and disability. In contrast, low educational attainment is associated with high rates of infectious disease, many chronic noninfectious diseases, self-reported poor health, shorter survival when sick, and shorter life expectancy (Feldman, Makuc, Kleinman, and Cornoni-Huntley 1989; Guralnik, Land, Fillenbaum, and Branch 1993; Gutzwiller, LaVecchia, Levi, Negri, and Wietlisbach 1989; Kaplan, Haan, and Syme 1987; Kitagawa and Hauser 1973; Liu, Cedres, and Stamler 1982; Morris 1990; Pappas, Queen,&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

A person is happy with better relationships, financial stability, good mental health, and longevity. Disinformation, stigma, ongoing isolation, and disruption of daily activities are all quite prevalent. Any of these elements may impact one&#x27;s mental health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken several steps to address COVID&#x27;s mental health concerns. In addition to frontline healthcare personnel, who engage in dealing with COVID-19, the general population&#x27;s mental health was also at stake due to the unprecedented and catastrophic emergency of COVID. Various keywords, including MeSH terms, were used in PubMed and Google Scholar searches. This paper was based on previously available data and article searches on how COVID-19 affected the mental health of the general population and the elements that may influence it. Quarantine and self-isolation have been found to have affected people&#x27;s daily livelihoods and behaviors, leading to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, dejection, insomnia, risky alcohol and drug use, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. Many of the victims of COVID-19 who were critical survivors exhibited lasting psychological harm a year after being discharged, including high anxiety levels, melancholy, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Healthcare employees too experienced significant psychological consequences due to factors such as an excessive workload or the number of hours worked, inadequate personal safety equipment, overly enthusiastic media coverage, and a sense of being under-supported. As a result of this major disaster, mental health concerns have surfaced, perhaps leading to long-term health problems, loneliness, and guilt. To reduce this deportment, global health solutions should be used, particularly while executing the isolation/quarantine and dealing with the people with fear and vulnerability. The mental health of the general population should be at the forefront of any worldwide response.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Deepak Vishwakarma&quot;,&quot;A.

Psychosocial variables and social determinants both have an important role in determining a person&#x27;s health and well-being. The psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of these issues can have an impact on a person&#x27;s behavior and health. Stress, education, poverty, social exclusion, discrimination, and violence are a few examples of these psychosocial determinants. These elements can be protective or, on the other hand, raise the risk of physical and mental illness and lower people&#x27;s quality of life. Social determinants of health are a combination of social, economic, and physical factors. They play a role in determining the patterns of illness, disease, and health that are observed in a population. They establish the circumstances in which people are conceived, develop, live, work, and age. Health and medical care, economic security, social and communal context, local geography and built environment, and education are all examples of social determinants of health. The connection between individuals and their social and physical environments frequently worsens poor health outcomes. Low socioeconomic position, unemployment, strained family ties, and hazardous neighborhoods have been shown in studies to have a significant negative impact on mental health. Additionally, those who suffer from severe psychological disorders are more probable to experience social segregation, poverty, food insecurity and housing uncertainty all of which can decrease quality of life and\u00a0hamper rehabilitation. Pakistan experienced the largest gain among the SAARC nations between 2013 and 2018, increasing its happiness score by 26 points, and is expected to rank among the top 20 gainers globally in 2020 [2]. However, it lowers to 4.934from 2018-2020\u00a0and is ranked 105 out of 149 happiest countries. There could be a number of causes for this downward tendency. The need of the hour is to pinpoint the causes of Pakistan&#x27;s declining happiness level. These findings would help policymakers get rid of or manage the factors contributing to people&#x27;s lower levels of happiness. It is improbable to understate the importance of social and psychological factors in determining health. Healthcare systems and politicians may create initiatives that successfully promote well-being, lessen health inequities, and enhance overall health outcomes by understanding and addressing these variables. A healthier and more equal society must be built via comprehensive strategies that incorporate socioeconomic inequities and mental health care. In order to promote a more inclusive and sustainable society, the international community is making great progress towards reaching many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are covering several SDGs described by United Nations which include: SDG 1, \u201cNo Poverty\u201d; SDG 2, \\&quot;Zero Hunger\\&quot;; SDG 3, \\&quot;Good Health and Well-being\\&quot;; SDG 4, \\&quot;Quality Education\\&quot;; SDG 5, \\&quot;Gender Equality\\&quot;; SDG 8, \\&quot;Decent Work and Economic Growth\\&quot; and SDG 10, \\&quot;Reduced Inequalities\\&quot;. The elimination of poverty, hunger, and inequality, as well as the promotion of sustainable economic growth, are the top priorities behind these objectives. By achieving these objectives, we can collectively work towards a more sustainable and equitable future in which no one is left behind.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Riffat Mehboob&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2023,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Pakistan Journal of Health Sciences&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/impact-psychological-social-determinants-health-mehboob/159021fe111e5366b45f35adcb47cd5c/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.54393/pjhs.v4i07.896&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:5},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Happiness and health across the lifespan in five major cities: The impact of place and government performance.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;RATIONALE\\nA growing body of research suggests that urban design has an effect on health and well-being. There have been very few studies to date, however, that compare these effects across the lifespan.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\nThe current study examines the direct and indirect effects of the city environment on happiness. It was hypothesised that citizens&#x27; ratings of their city along dimensions of performance (e.g., basic - usually government - services related to education, healthcare, social services, and policing) and place (e.g., the beauty of the city and a built environment that provides access to cultural, sport, park, transport, and shopping amenities) would be significant predictors of happiness but that the nature of these effects would change over the lifespan.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\n5000 adults aged 25-85 years old living in Berlin, Paris, London, New York, and Toronto completed the Quality of Life Survey in 2007. Respondents reported their happiness levels and evaluated their city along place and performance dimensions.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe results of the study demonstrate an interesting, and complex relationship between the city environment and happiness of residents across the lifespan. Findings suggest that the happiness of younger residents is a function of having easy access to cultural, shopping, transport, parks and sport amenities and the attractiveness of their cities (i.e. place variables). The happiness of older residents is associated more with the provision of quality governmental services (i.e., performance variables). Place and performance variables also have an effect on health and social connections, which are strongly linked to happiness for all residents.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nYounger adults&#x27; happiness is more strongly related to the accessibility of amenities that add to the quality of a city&#x27;s cultural and place characteristics; older adults&#x27; happiness is more strongly related to the quality of services provided within a city that enable residents to age in place. These results indicate that, in order to be all things to all people, cities should emphasize quality services (e.g., good policing, schools, healthcare access), beauty and character, and provide easy access to transport amenities and cultural and recreational opportunities.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

Physical appearance is one of the first individual characteristics noticed by others and has an important impact on social interactions and therefore has become very important construct in contemporary societies. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the influence of physical exercise on the subjective well\u2010being dimension related to better health and eventually happiness. In contrast, the physical inactivity determined by the increasing amount of time spent in sedentary activities is becoming an issue with serious conse\u2010 quences, being the cause of more than 5 million death/year globally. Physical activ \u2010 ity favorably influences mental health, improves the emotional state and reduces the incidence and severity of diseases and pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and obesity. Promoting physical activity, physical and health education and sport as healthy lifestyle components in schools, universities and lifelong learning targets the enhacement of vigour, resilience, employement, and social outcomes for graduates and comunities. Motives of physi\u2010 cal inactivity were discussed aiming to underpin possible remedial solution for better health, quality of life and well\u2010being.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

Increased concern over student wellbeing has fostered the demand for positive education interventions \u2013 a relatively new topic requiring more research. We tested a positive psychology wellbeing intervention imbedded in undergraduate psychology classes with three studies and 469 participants. Intervention outcomes across three years indicate improvements in wellbeing, positive affect, negative affect and clinical wellbeing categories. Comparisons with an active control indicated the intervention buffered against semester stress. Practice frequency had little effect on wellbeing, however wellbeing gains were higher for students with low baseline wellbeing and those who valued happiness more \u2013 suggesting positive education interventions have greater value for some students. This research has important implications for student wellbeing, indicating that imbedded wellbeing programs can improve student wellbeing with minimal resources and low stigma.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Tarli K.

Biomedical and psychological research has come a long way in identifying the importance of mental health and its impact on behavioral risk factors, physiological health, and overall quality of life. Despite this, access to psychological and psychiatric services remains widely unavailable and is a challenge for many healthcare systems, particularly those in developing countries. This review article highlights the strengths and opportunities brought forward by digital mental health in narrowing this divide. Further, it points to the economic and societal benefits of effectively managing mental illness, making a case for investing resources into mental healthcare as a larger priority for large non-governmental organizations and individual nations across the globe.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Manuel Faria&quot;,&quot;Stella Tan Pei Zin&quot;,&quot;Roman Chestnov&quot;,&quot;Anne Marie Novak&quot;,&quot;S.

Communicable diseases such as HIV, TB, Malaria and the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are impacting many of the world&#x27;s poorest and most vulnerable populations, and depressing economic development. Sickness and disease has decreased the size and capabilities of the workforce through impeding access to education and suppressing foreign direct investment (FDI). There is clear evidence that by investing in health improvements a significant increase in GDP per capita can be attained in four ways: Firstly, healthier populations are more economically productive; secondly, proactive healthcare leads to decrease in many of the additive healthcare costs associated with lack of care (treating opportunistic infections in the case of HIV for example); thirdly, improved health represents a real economic and developmental outcome in-and-of itself and finally, healthcare spending capitalises on the Keynesian &#x27;economic multiplier&#x27; effect. Continued under-investment in health and health systems represent an important threat to our future global prosperity. This editorial calls for a recognition of health as a major engine of economic growth and for commensurate investment in public health, particularly in poor countries.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

Health literacy refers to the ability to access, process, and use health information to make appropriate decisions to promote good overall health. Low levels of health literacy are associated with a host of negative outcomes such as less efficient use of healthcare services, higher healthcare costs, increased mortality, and poorer self-rated health. In those with medical conditions (e.g., diabetes), lower health literacy is linked with higher levels of depression. It is important to investigate whether mental health is linked to health literacy as understanding these links has the potential to identify those at risk for negative outcomes and thus implement protective strategies. Therefore, the current study sought to determine the extent to which various mental health constructs such as happiness, well-being, anxiety and depression are related to health literacy in a community-based sample of cognitively healthy individuals. We hypothesized that higher levels of health literacy would be associated with higher self-reported well-being, happiness, and lower anxiety and depression. Participants and Methods: Design - Cross-sectional, prospective study. Setting - Community-based. 93 individuals were included with mean age=59.02 years (SD=15.12) and mean education=15.70 (SD=2.39). 60% were women, the majority were White (55%) while 38% were Black and 7% belonged to other races; 90% were non-Hispanic. Measures: Health Literacy - Health literacy was measured by an 8-item instrument in the Rush Memory and Aging Project that examined the participant\u2019s understanding of health care, treatment, and related behaviors. Happiness - Happiness was measured by 5 items from the Satisfaction with Life Scale using a 7-point scale (1 = strongly agree; 7 = strongly disagree). Higher scores indicated lower levels of happiness. Well-being - Well-being was measured with an 18-item instrument from the Rush Memory and Aging project, with higher scores indicating better well-being. Statistics: Bivariate correlations between age, education, and mental health measures and health literacy were examined. Results: Higher level of health literacy was significantly associated with age (r = .282 p = .009) and education (r = .228 p = .039). Contrary to our hypothesis, health literacy was not significantly associated with happiness (r = .002 p = .987), well-being (r = .037 p = .742), depression (r = .005 p = .962) or anxiety (r = -.064 p = .568). Even after controlling for age and education, these associations remained significant. Conclusions: Higher level of healthy literacy was associated with older age and higher level of education. However, no significant association was found between health literacy and mental health measures of happiness, well-being, depression, and anxiety in cognitively healthy individuals, even after controlling for demographics. The lack of such associations in this study was unexpected and suggests that other factors such as the presence of health conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer) might critically contribute to such associations. Future studies should examine these associations in a larger context to better understand how to promote healthy self-care behaviors.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Miji A Suhr&quot;,&quot;Silvia Chapman&quot;,&quot;Jillian L.

The 46th West African College of Physicians Annual General and Scientific Meeting focuses on Health and Wellbeing Amidst a Prolonged Pandemic. Health and wellbeing are closely related components critical to healthy living and cannot be considered independent of each other. While health is a state of total wellbeing; wellbeing is intricately linked with happiness and satisfaction in life. The COVID- 19 pandemic has significantly impacted the health and well-being of nations all over the world. In the wake of the pandemic came the COVID-19 recession which brought a crash in the global economy, reduction in productivity, rise in unemployment, massive layoffs, collapse of businesses and manufacturing industries, disruptions in transportation and much more. These harsh economic realities have placed a huge strain on global mental health resulting in physical, mental and social disorders. The workload of the average physician and other health care workers increased tremendously resulting in burnout and psychological stress with a consequent increase in the incidence of psychological disorders including anxiety, depression, suicide and suicidal ideation amongst others. The lack of preparedness for the pandemic and the inequality in strength of healthcare systems across the world prolonged the pandemic and its adverse consequences on health and wellbeing of the populace. Promotion of health and well-being of health care professionals and the populace at large is essential for the growth of any economy and is an essential consideration for stakeholders involved in disease prevention and health promotion.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;G.

If it does, what are the mechanisms by which education affects well-being? We propose that education improves well-being because it increases access to nonalienated paid work and economic resources that increase the sense of control over life, as well as access to stable social relationships, especially marriage, that increase social support. We examine the relationship between education and a variety of indicators of subjective quality of life-depression, anxiety, anger, aches and pains, malaise, and dissatisfaction. Using two representative national samples collected in 1990 and 1995, we find that the well educated have lower levels of emotional distress (including depression, anxiety, and anger) and physical distress (including aches and pains and malaise), but they do not have lower levels of dissatisfaction. Education reduces distress largely by way of paid work, nonalienated work, and economic resources, which are associated with high personal control; but the extent to which it reduces distress by way of marriage and social support is much more modest. We contrast distress and dissatisfaction as indicators of the subjective quality of life.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C. Ross&quot;,&quot;M. V.

However, the relationship between the SDOH and happiness of older adults have not received the requisite recognition in Ghana. This study examined the relationship between the SDOH and happiness of older adults in Ghana. Methods The study used data from the 2014/2015 Ghana Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) Wave 2. Data was analysed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique to investigate the direct, indirect and covariances of the SDOH and happiness of older adults. Results The results showed positive relationship between the SDOH and happiness among older adults. The economic stability ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.07), neighbourhood and built environment ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.02, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.001), access to quality education ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.56, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.01), access to healthy food ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.48, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.001) social and community context ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.41, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.05), and access to quality healthcare ( \u03b2 \u2009=\u20090.80, P \u2009&lt;\u20090.001) had direct relationship with happiness of the older adults in Ghana. Conclusion This study shows that the conditions in which older adults were born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age (SDOH) positively impact their happiness in later life. Neighbourhood and physical environment influence the effect of quality education on happiness of older adults. Social policies and interventions aiming at happiness of older adults should consider the social determinants of health and the mediating effects of food on happiness through quality education, and quality of healthcare system.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

This study explored the relationship between these well-being constructs by applying widely used measures with satisfactory psychometric properties. Materials and Methods University students (n = 180) completed widely used well-being measures including the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ), the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. We analyzed the data using correlation, regression, and exploratory factor analysis. Results All included well-being measures demonstrated high loadings on the global well-being construct that explains about 80% of the variance in the OHQ, the psychological domain of Quality of Life and subjective well-being. The results show high positive correlations between happiness, psychological and health domains of quality of life, life satisfaction, and positive affect. Social and environmental domains of quality of life were poor predictors of happiness and subjective well-being after controlling for psychological quality of life. Conclusion Together, these data provide support for a global well-being dimension and interchangeable use of terms happiness, subjective well-being, and psychological quality of life with the current sample and measures.

Global health education programs should strive continually to improve the quality of education, increase access, create communities that foster excellence in global health practices, and ensure sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the University of Minnesota\u2019s extensive global health education programs, which includes a decade of hybrid online and in-person programing, to move completely online. We share our experience, a working framework for evaluating global health educational programming, and lessons learned. Over the decades we have moved from a predominantly passive, lecture-based, in-person course to a hybrid online (passive) course with an intensive hands-on 2-week requirement. The pandemic forced us to explore new active online learning models. We retained our on-demand, online passive didactics, which used experts\u2019 time efficiently and was widely accessible and well received. In addition, we developed a highly effective synchronous online component that we felt replaced some of the hands-on activities effectively and led us to develop new and innovative \u201chands-on\u201d experiences. This new, fully online model combining quality asynchronous and synchronous learning provided many unanticipated advantages, such as increasing access while decreasing our carbon footprint dramatically. By sharing our experience, lessons learned, and resources, we hope to inspire other programs likewise to innovate to improve quality, access, community, and sustainability in global health, especially if these innovations can help decrease negative aspects of global health education such as its environmental impact.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Kristina M.

A wide range of mental wellness programmes have been explored to provide students with pleasant and satisfying experiences. The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of integrating Zen meditation and music listening on the mindfulness and happiness levels of university music therapy students. A qualitative methodology was used, and data were collected through surveys and semi-structured interviews. To investigate various aspects of data regarding the role of the meditation and music (MM) programme for mindfulness and happiness, this study used thematic analysis within a qualitative research design. The findings of this study suggest that the 8-week Mindfulness Meditation (MM) programme is a potential approach for enhancing mindfulness, happiness and stress management. These results carry broader implications, particularly in terms of supporting mental health resources in higher education. Furthermore, the study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the positive impact of combining meditation and music to promote mental well-being. This integrated approach has the potential to strengthen coping strategies and further promote the integration of music and meditation practices in various contexts, including higher education.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Mi Hyang Hwang&quot;,&quot;Leslie Bunt&quot;,&quot;Catherine Warner&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2023,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/meditation-music-programme-mindfulness-happiness-hwang/309b5b02fbec5cfa89395ccd3376a1a4/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.3390/ijerph20237140&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;20&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:20}]}"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"invoked_plugin": {"type": "remote", "namespace": "chat_consensus_app__jit_plugin", "plugin_id": "g-f1286ecb04957580332cda9bf386b57ef1b2ed6f", "http_response_status": 200}, "jit_plugin_data": {"from_server": {"type": "preview", "body": {"domain": "chat.consensus.app", "is_consequential": false, "privacy_policy": "https://consensus.app/home/privacy-policy/", "method": "get", "path": "/quick_search", "operation": "search_papers", "params": {"query": "impact of access to education, healthcare, and mental health resources on global happiness and well-being"}, "actions": []}}}, "gizmo_id": "g-bo0FiWLY7", "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", "parent_id": "6262b46b-7fbf-4ec5-9a3d-4ef911e056ae", "request_id": "8826b7fae88c839a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "6262b46b-7fbf-4ec5-9a3d-4ef911e056ae", "children": ["9000f2ce-5c96-4f19-bf39-99151c7d1758"]}, "9000f2ce-5c96-4f19-bf39-99151c7d1758": {"id": "9000f2ce-5c96-4f19-bf39-99151c7d1758", "message": {"id": "9000f2ce-5c96-4f19-bf39-99151c7d1758", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715478245.579908, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Here are a couple of academic sources that support the claims and assertions made in Parts B and C of your document regarding the impact of access to education, healthcare, and mental health resources on global happiness and well-being:\n\n1. **Workplace-Based Organizational Interventions Promoting Mental Health and Happiness among Healthcare Workers: A Realist Review** - This paper discusses how workplace-based interventions at the organizational level promote mental health and wellbeing among healthcare workers, emphasizing the importance of mental health on happiness and wellbeing.

While the concept of QOL is contestable, a number of studies have revealed that travel can increase an individual\u2019s perceived and actual QOL. To date, the focus has been on vacation travel, highlighting that travel primarily for the purpose of rest or recreation, whether to a holiday destination or touring, is a component of many people\u2019s perceived QOL, and in some cases is a critical component. However, these more expensive forms of vacation travel are less accessible to those classified as socio-economically disadvantaged. Many such individuals can and do visit friends and relatives (VFR), suggesting that VFR may be a critical means by which socio-economically disadvantaged people can travel for pleasure and thereby maintain or improve their QOL.

According to this approach, an individual&#x27;s behaviours, cognitions, and feelings about travelling are analyzed against the social background, that is, how the individual influences and is influenced by others. The main question is addressed to the motivation for recreational travel: why do people travel for recreation? Why do they choose this activity over others? While variations in motives can be found between and within individuals and between various types of travel (vacation versus weekend travel), the basic psychological mechanism is likely to be the same for most of recreational travel. It is shown that like leisure behaviour in general, recreational travel is a dialectical optimizing process, in which two forces simultaneously influence a person: the desire to leave the personal and/or interpersonal environment behind oneself and the desire to pursue or gain certain personal and/or interpersonal rewards. This process ...&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

Thus, the study aimed at assessing the impacts of physical activity on well-being during vacation by taking a longitudinal approach. We utilized a pre-post within-subject design (n = 101) by testing vacationers prior to, during, and after their vacation in an alpine environment. Therefore, a series of eight linear mixed model analyses of co-variance was performed. The results suggested that the duration of a vacation and the amount of physical activity have a positive impact on the components of well-being, which was expressed by changes in the activation, elation, excitement, and calmness subscales of the Mood Survey Scale. Demographic patterns did not reveal any influences. Physical activity might be a marker for well-being, which influences people\u2019s everyday life and leisure time behavior by motivating them to engage in more physical activity. This research extends the existing literature by (1) proving the effects of vacations on well-being, (2) pointing out the effects of demographic predeterminations, and (3) gathering in-depth knowledge about the role of physical activity in changes to well-being.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Philipp Schlemmer&quot;,&quot;C.

The effects of recreational travel on cognitive flexibility and originality&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Abstract Recreational travel may increase creativity by relieving workers from stress, providing diversifying experiences and increasing positive emotions. Consequently, vacations may boost creativity, apparent in a greater variety (flexibility) and originality of ideas after work resumption. In our longitudinal field study, creativity (measured by Guilford&#x27;s Alternative Uses Task; independently scored by three raters) was assessed in 46 workers before and after vacation. Potential precursors for creativity changes (i.e. work load, vacation hassles, vacation destination and positive affect) were also explored. Cognitive flexibility increased whereas originality remained the same after vacation. None of the precursors explained variance in creativity changes. Although vacations seem to increase chances on creative insights by raising the amount of available cognitive elements (flexibility), they do not necessarily lead to higher levels of originality (uncommon, remote and clever ideas). Research in larger samples is required to further explore mechanisms that may explain why travel seems to enhance creativity.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J. Bloom&quot;,&quot;S.

Recent research has provided considerable evidence that visits to near-natural everyday landscapes promote psychological and physical health. However, little is so far known about the effects of people\u2019s regular outdoor recreation in their local natural environment on their well-being and, in particular, on their psychological resilience. In our project we address this research gap by investigating nearby outdoor recreation behaviour in three urbanized regions in Switzerland, each of which has a different predominant culture and language (German, French and Italian speaking). A standardized questionnaire was sent to a random sample of residents ( N =1200) in each region. Stepwise regression supported the hypothesis that regular nearby outdoor recreation has a significant but rather marginal effect on respondents\u2019 reported well-being and their psychological resilience, even when systematically controlled. However, similar effect sizes, in particular in terms of psychological resilience, were found with other leisure activities. More generally, we found that well-being and psychological resilience were influenced by different factors, and that increasing psychological resilience mainly required a long duration of recreation or leisure activities. Management implications This paper provides robust evidence that urban inhabitants\u2019 regular outdoor recreation in the nearby natural environment has positive effects on their emotional well-being and their psychological resilience. The findings suggest that the quality of the nearby recreation area is at least an as important condition for these benefits as the easy access to these areas. Inhabitants\u2019 satisfaction with the recreation area, their activity level within the recreation areas as well as the time spent in the recreation areas appeared to be more relevant predictors for these benefits than the frequency of visits in these areas.

A fundamental perception, which is that going on holiday will enable people to satisfy their needs to rest and relax, exists. In a literature analysis it was determined that there is a definite link between leisure activities and improved psychological well-being, but the relationship between specific tourist and travel activities and improved psychological well-being has not yet been researched. There is also evidence that the holiday experience may not always foster happiness, satisfaction and relaxation, causing what is commonly known as the &#x27;holiday syndrome&#x27;. One of the outcomes of this research showed that up to 30% of the people going on pre-organised tours experienced a clear non-positive impact (not affected or negative impact) on their psychological well-being. Due to the importance of knowing why there are a significant number of tourists who return home feeling unaffected or worse after the holiday tours, possible reasons for the decrease in their well-being were explored. Main stress factors on the tours were identified as too tight time schedules, too little personal time and too much driving. \\nKeywords: Tourism, Tourist and travel activity, Psychological well-being, Happiness\\n South African Journal for Research in Sport, Physical Education and Recreation Vol.26(1) 2004: 97-106&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

However, the topic has recently started to be studied on the transportation research field. This increasing interest in recreation travel reflects the fact that the share of recreation trips is rapidly increasing in many countries, and is expected to further increase due to changes in socio-demographics, lifestyles and other dynamic processes. Besides, these activities generate trips, and when summed up with the usual daily commuting trips contribute to emission levels and congestion and consequently, to the decrease of mobility and quality of life. In the Randstad area these mobility problems are even greater. Because of changes in the offerings of leisure and tourism products and services, the associated travel may contribute increasingly to emissions and a better understanding of this behavior from the perspective of sustainable development is therefore highly relevant. The individual\u2019s travel behavior may change over time, given different family lifecycle stages. For instance, the arrival of the first child may change drastically the recreation decisions of a young couple. Based on the exposed, the goal of this research was to better understand agenda formation and the dynamics of specific facets of recreation behavior as a function of lifecycle, controlling for others. The facets that make part of the recreation agenda formation (such as destination, transport mode, etc) are strongly dependent from each other. Thus, it is important to capture this notion of portfolio choice when studying recreation decisions. In the context of this research, recreation includes both vacation (tourism) and out-of-home leisure activities. Several analyses were performed, based on four different sources of data. The first dataset is a panel called CVO collected by NBTC-NIPO, where 838 respondents were followed from 2002 to 2009. It collects information about the annual holiday behavior of Dutch people. Several analyses were performed with the goal of exploring the determinants of vacation agenda formation of different lifecycle groups. A Bayesian belief network (BN) was applied in order to find relationships between lifecycle stages and other variables of the vacation portfolio. The resulting network showed the direct and indirect relations between socio-demographic variables and the variables that make part of a vacation portfolio. Some clear relationships, largely consistent with the existing literature, were found. Overall, the results indicated the interdependencies between choice facets underlying vacation portfolios and their relationships with certain socio-demographic variables. The focus was then shifted to the individual level, with the development of two models meant to better understand agenda formation and the dynamics of specific facets as a function of lifecycle stages, controlling for other variables. These models account for heterogeneity in individual preferences (mixed logit model). The first model explored transport mode choice, and in addition, complementarity and substitution patterns between the transport mode alternatives. Results demonstrated that the proposed model formulation is valuable to analyze tourist\u2019s choices over time as it allows parameters associated with each variable to vary randomly across individuals. Coefficients showed that Dutch tourists prefer to use the car for their vacation trips. The other modes act as complements to the car, whereas they substitute each other when car is not used for vacation trips. This may indicate that respondents tend to adapt to the available transport mode options. Car ownership seems to affect the decisions of the other tourist components (destination, travel party etc). The same holds for the contrary, for households without a car or when the car cannot be used because of imposed constraints, e.g., a destination too far away, the public transport options will then act as substitutes to each other. Based on the empirical results of the estimated coefficients for the interactions between transport mode choice and the socio-demographic variables (lifecycle and income), some conclusions can be drawn. First, the differences in behavior given individual\u2019s lifecycle stages can be explained in general by flexibility/constraints given age and/or household composition. Furthermore, the interaction between the transport mode choice and income resulted in coefficients that increase linearly as income level increases. The findings from this study also suggest that transport mode choice is strongly associated to the overall vacation profile decisions, as most of the interaction effects between the dependent and independent variables are significant. The other model developed based on the second dataset investigated choice of vacation length of stay. This dynamic mixed logit model accounted for both state dependency and heterogeneity in respondent\u2019s preferences. Length of stay options included short (1 to 3 nights), medium (4 to 9 nights), long (10 nights or more) vacations, and the decision not to go on vacation in a particular month in a specific year, used as the reference level in the model specification. The effects of seasonality, income, lifecycle stages characteristics and the influence of past choices in the choice of vacation length of stay were explored. Seasonality effects were accounted with the inclusion of month-specific variables. Results indicate that Dutch vacationers have preferences for taking their vacation during the main holidays periods and warm seasons. As for lifecycle stages, it seems that vacation choices are rather affected by the age of the children present in the household than by the age of the parents. In the case of income, results are in line with expectations and with the results shown previously on the transport mode choice model: utility increases with increasing income levels. The second dataset was collected through an Internet-based survey, using a software developed by our research group. The aim was to better understand the determinants of vacation choice of a sample of students. A literature review was developed, followed by a descriptive analysis of the student\u2019s past and intended vacation behavior. Further, a stated choice portfolio experiment specifically to analyze the factors influencing transport mode choice of students in the context of their vacation behavior. Results of the multinomial logit model indicate that costs predominantly influence their portfolio choices, especially because of the advent of the low-fare airlines. The attributes that are significant tend to amplify the specific role of transport modes in general and low-fare airlines in particular. The reference-dependent model for airlines preference confirm this finding as price sensitivity for low-fare airlines was higher than for the other modes. The third dataset was collected using a web-based survey. The 838 respondents who participated in the CVO data collection were invited to complete an online survey with a set of additional questions regarding their vacation plans. The aim was to explore if there are differences between choice facets in terms of when they are planned and to analyze the effect of lifecycle stages, income and travel experience in the level of vacation planning. Estimated coefficients show that the probability of a facet being planned increases as time to the vacation trip decreases, and that are differences in terms of when different vacation facets are planned. The fourth dataset is about leisure activities (CVTO), collected in 2008 by NBTC-NIPO. A BN model was developed in order to find direct and indirect associations between the variables. Then, a binary mixed logit model accounting for heterogeneity in individual preferences was estimated; complementarity and substitution patterns between leisure purpose alternatives were analyzed. Results demonstrated that the proposed model formulation is valuable to analyze individual\u2019s choices over time as it allows parameters associated with each variable to vary randomly across individuals. In terms of such substitution and complementary relationships between activity purposes it was found that outdoor activities decrease the propensity to perform sports or hobbies/courses activities. However, it increases the propensity to perform fun shopping and going out/culture. Based on the empirical results of the estimated coefficients for the interactions between leisure activity purpose and socio-demographics variables, some conclusions can be drawn. First, the differences in behavior given individual\u2019s lifecycle stages are in general explained by the flexibility/constraints spectrum typical of each group. Gender and social class exerts a small influence on activity purpose choice, although there are some differences between alternatives. The findings from this study also suggest that leisure activity purpose choice is strongly associated to the activity-related variables as most of the interaction effects between the dependent and independent variables are significant. The analysis of the importance of each attribute to the overall utility of an alternative indicates that especially lifecycle stages and travel party strongly influences activity purpose choice. The overall results in relation to the influence of lifecycle stages on vacation and leisure activities choice suggest that the differences in behavior given individual\u2019s lifecycle stages are in general explained by the flexibility or constraints typical of each group. Time and budget availability, and imposed constraints given age and/or household composition are the main factors explaining these differences. A better understanding of agenda formation of individuals as a function of their lifecycle stage characteristics is therefore highly relevant from the perspective of urban sustainable development.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Ab Anna Grigolon&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2009,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/modeling-recreation-choices-family-lifecycle-grigolon/2262706938c85f158880b009bbc68151/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.6100/IR741235&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:8},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Towards the recovery mechanisms of leisure travel experiences: does the length of vacation matter?&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;ABSTRACT This research examines the recovery mechanisms of leisure travel experiences with a focus on the moderating role of vacation duration. Results from a sample of 509 US respondents shows that autonomy is a requisite in the link between tourism experiences and life satisfaction, while its effect on life satisfaction is mediated by passive and active tourism experiences. Another key finding is that shorter leisure trips tend to facilitate the passive route to life satisfaction, while longer trips can better facilitate the active route.

Within the scope of the physical-mental-social paradigm of active ageing, it has been shown that leisure activities contribute to older people\u2019s physical and psychological well-being. Tourism, which fits all definitions of leisure, has unique characteristics that mean it can connect the crucial aspects of healthy ageing identified in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE): psychological health, well-being, life satisfaction, and social networks. The positive effect of tourism on the quality of life of individuals over 65 years old, unrelated to any underlying clinical condition, was confirmed through the concept of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), measured with the results of self-administered questionnaires among a sample of people over 65 years of age and compared with the results for the reference population.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Manuela Vega-V\u00e1zquez&quot;,&quot;M.

Study participants identified a range of social and health benefits, including maintaining social connections with family and friends, opportunities to participate in physical activity, and reducing stress. However, many of these trips are by car. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of private car ownership internationally, low-density urban development, and a poor public transport infrastructure. Social and recreational trips make up a sizeable proportion of domestic travel and are contributing to New Zealand\u2019s increasing rate of CO2 emissions. There is an obvious need to address the negative ecological impacts of human activity. Our findings suggest that alongside strategies to reduce CO2 emissions, it also is important to introduce measures to maintain the benefits from social and recreational travel.

However, most studies pertaining to the topic have been conducted in the fields of organizational behavior and health science. Therefore, this research attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the health and wellness benefits of travel. The results revealed that positive effects of travel experiences on perceived health and wellness have been demonstrated by multiple studies. These benefits have been found to gradually diminish after a vacation. It was also found that there is a lack of research demonstrating the positive effect of travel experiences on physical health.

Having a holiday may be a good way to reduce work-related stress and reduced mood and improve perceived immune fitness. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess the impact of having a holiday or work on perceived immune fitness and mood. A survey was held among N = 246 young adults who were on holiday in Fiji, and N = 87 subjects who were in Fiji for work. The sample comprised both students and individuals with a job at home. Past year immune status was assessed with the Immune Status Questionnaire (ISQ). Current perceived immune functioning and mood were rated from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent). Assessments were made for two occasions: (1) the current situation (in Fiji), and (2) at home (before traveling). Compared to being at home, both students and working individuals on holiday in Fiji reported significantly improved immune fitness and significantly improved mood. For example, both groups reported reduction of stress of about 60% while in Fiji. In students who came to Fiji for work or spending a holiday, improvements in perceived immune fitness were more pronounced than in working people coming on holiday in Fiji. In contrast, working people on holiday reported greater improvements in mood compared to students. The magnitude of improvements were significantly greater among women than men. In conclusion, the data suggest that both having a holiday or working in Fiji is associated with significant improvements of mood, which were themselves associated with improved immune fitness. The findings are of importance for the tourism industry as they demonstrate that, in addition to leisure (or being active) as a purpose for having a holiday, the observed mental health benefits and improved perceived immune fitness provide an additional motive to have a holiday.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Individual and societal well-being are critical indicators of social sustainability. However, little attention, from both a research and policy perspective, has been paid to the impacts of transportation on well-being. With extensive urban expansion resulting from rapid urbanization, commuting has become a physical and mental burden for many residents in the megacities of China because of increasing travel distances and worsening travel experiences. This study aims to contribute to the growing literature on the relationship between transportation and well-being and also to quantitatively test this relationship in the Chinese context using data from a survey conducted in Xi-an, a mega-city of western China. The results from a structural equation modeling analysis suggest that travel characteristics, including travel mode choice and level of service, significantly influence travel satisfaction, and in turn significantly affect overall satisfaction of life. These findings highlight the importance of transportation-related strategies on improving well-being.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R. Ye&quot;,&quot;H.

That is a world to which all of us can aspire\nand for which we can work, for the sake of our grandchildren\u2019s futures and\ntheirs. Read and lift your expectations; a saner world is possible, and surely\nmost desirable. \n\n\u2014 RAY ANDERSON, Founder and Chairman of Interface, Inc. \n\nMark Anielski does a wonderful job in laying bare the difference between\nmoney and genuine wealth and relating them to our economic growth addic-\ntion. It sounds easy but we all need a lot of training in the use of economic\nconcepts if we are going to be able to find a cure for the monetary madness in\nthis world. \n\n\u2014 OSCAR KJELLBERG, President &amp; CEO, JAK Members Bank, Stockholm\n\nAn inspired and readable inquiry into an \u201coikonomia for the people.\u201d Great\nquestions, with a wealth of perspectives and insightful answers. \n\n\u2014 RAFFI CAVOUKIAN, C.M., singer, author, ecology advocate, \nfounder of Child Honouring \n\nIt is essential that we transform our societies from ones that worship greed\ninto ones that are sustainable, compassionate, and peaceful. The Economics of\nHappiness provides a rationale for beginning this journey immediately and of-\nfers a detailed methodology for measuring our progress along the path. \n\n\u2014 JOHN PERKINS, New York Times bestselling author of Confessions of an \nEconomic Hit Man and The Secret History of the American Empire\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page i\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Happiness will spark an important discussion about one of the\nmajor challenges of our time: how to achieve a balanced, sustainable way of\nlife, where notions of progress and genuine wealth are understood as being\nfundamentally interrelated. To help us on this journey, Mark Anielski points\nto the promise of transformational work in raising our understanding about a\nnew perspective for how we conduct our present and future. \n\n\u2014 HON. ROY ROMANOW, P.C., O.C., Q.C., Former Premier of Saskatchewan,\nChair, Canadian Index of Wellbeing Network Board\n\nIf those who set the goals of society and measure success in reaching them \nbehaved rationally, they would long since have ceased to use per capita Gross\nDomestic Product as the major guide. Until now there has been no full-scale\nstudy demonstrating this and developing a more appropriate alternative.\nWith The Economics of Happiness, the last shred of justification for the exclusive\nfocus on market activity is gone. If this focus is continued, that can only mean\nthat those who profit from our wearing blinders control policy. \n\n\u2014 JOHN B. COBB, JR., theologian and co-author of For the Common Good\n\nWhat is the purpose of our economy and our work if not to support happy\nlives? The Economics of Happiness shows how far we have drifted from that goal\nand details ways to get back on the path to happiness in our personal lives, \nin our businesses and in economic policy.\n\n\u2014 GIFFORD PINCHOT III, Founder and President, \nBainbridge Graduate Institute\n\nReading The Economics of Happiness is a real treat; it is not often that one finds\necomonics, philosophy and ethics brought together so closely. \u201cBeggar the\nnext generation\u201d is no longer acceptable in resource policy. In other words,\nmake room for ethics. That is the message throughout this book.\n\n\u2014 RT. HON. EDWARD R.

In this power-\nful, insightful book, Mark Anielski exposes how this approach actually stunts\nour growth and prevents us from achieving a life that is rich in all senses of\nthe word. Breaking ranks with his fellow economists, Anielski shows how we\ncan make the economy serve the interests of society, not the other way around. \n\n\u2014 LINDA MCQUAIG, author and journalist\n\nMark Anielski\u2019s The Economics of Happiness provides an interesting and inform-\native look at money, economics, wealth and what it all means. The lessons in\nthis book provide a timely guide as our society begins the paradigm shift\naway from crass consumer capitalism toward more sustainable economies and\ncommunities where people and the planet matter. \n\n\u2014 DEAN KUBANi, Environmental Programs Manager \nfor the City of Santa Monica\n\nIn these times, even the best of us are falling short in courageously charting\nnew maps \u2014 and more importantly avoiding heading out without a map at\nall! Mark Anielski is a great pioneer of our time, and The Economics of Happi-\nness is \u201cthe emperor has no clothes\u201d rallying cry our world so desperately\nneeds. This book is a critical part of the architecture of a new system. It is a\nmust read for anyone serious about living differently with each other and the\nplanet. Quite simply \u2014 LOVE is the only true economics, and when we ex-\npress love it does not get used up, it multiplies.  \n\n\u2014 ANITA M. BURKE, Sustainability Elder and former Senior Advisor to the\nCommittee of Managing Directors at Shell International\n\nThe Economics of Happiness helps organizations evolve from satisfying \u201cShow\nme the money!\u201d demands from shareholders to satisfying \u201cShow me the gen-\nuine wealth!\u201d demands from stakeholders.

He did so by\nfollowing his values. In so doing he changed his own life, and we are all the\nbeneficiaries. The Economics of Happiness pushes economics back to its more\nhonorable roots and, in so doing, shows us the way towards what is truly a\nnew common wealth. \n\n\u2014 BOB WILLIAMS, Senior Research Fellow, \nVancouver City Savings Credit Union \n\nWe live in a world where money, always a means for something else, has become\na goal in itself.

Peter, an immigrant to\nCanada from Austria in the early 1920s, was a gardener all his life. He under-\nstood what made life worthwhile: the value of time spent with those he loved\nand in the many gardens he nurtured.\n\nTo my parents, Hans-Ulrich and Mary Ann Anielski, who taught me\nhow to dream and act on my dreams with conviction and leadership. They\ntaught me about how to live a life of faith, love, meaningful relationships and\nabout the virtue of meaningful, life-giving work as vocation. \n\nTo my life partner and wife, Jennifer Haslett, who has taught me the joys\nof love and reciprocal relationship; of reconciliation, laughter and most im-\nportantly of open and honest dialogue. And to our two daughters Ren\u00e9e and\nStephanie, who teach me every day about unconditional love and real hap-\npiness. Like my Opa and our elders, my children are teaching me how to\ncelebrate life in the moment of experience and how to breathe love in each\nprecious second of living. Children have a remarkable gift for asking tough\nquestions; this book is dedicated to answering some of those questions which\nstill linger into adulthood.\n\nLike the book of life, this book is the result of years of many wonderful\nconversations and enduring relationships with friends and colleagues around\nthe world. I would like to thank David Korten for encouraging me to write\nthis book and my students at Bainbridge Graduate Institute near Seattle,\nespecially Kate Kaemerle who took the \u0160rst steps with me on this journey by\ncompelling me to \u201cwrite it down, Mark!\u201d To Chris and Judith Plant and\nIngrid Witvoet of New Society Publishers for believing in my message. To\nBetsy Nuse, my wonderful editor whose loving edits have helped shape this\nbook into a crystal of wisdom. To Sue Custance and Diane McIntosh for the\nexquisite cover design that adorns this book, including the idea for a\n\nxiii\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/26/2007  12:21 PM  Page xiii\n\n\n\nFibonnaci sequence which is the golden ratio revealed in nature especially\n\u0161owers. To Jane Haslett, my mother-in-law whose unwavering dedication to\nthe initial edits of this book and her wonderful encouragement continually\nbuoyed my spirit. And to many other friends and colleagues who have in-\nspired and shared in my spiritual and earthly journey including Judi Hoyt,\nRobertFelty,AaronBraaten,AnitaBurke, JoeyHundert,MichaelHaynes,Bill\nHarder, Ernie Zelinski, Orest Andre, Dominic Misho, Boudewijn Wegerif\n(deceased), Jeff Wilson, Kelvin Hirsch, Randy Hirsch, Steve Janzen, Derek\nRasmussen, Pat Klak, Bernard Lietaer, Libba and Gifford Pinchot III, Pat\nCarmack, Mel Hurtig, Oscar Kjellberg, Karl-Heinrik Robert, Leslie Christ-\nian, Bob Willard, Bob Williams, Herman Daly, John Cobb Jr., Ken Chap-\nman, Marilyn Waring, Hazel Henderson, Janine Benyus, Linda McQuaig,\nHarold Wynne, Brian and Mary Nattrass, Michael Percy, Colin Soskolne, Bill\nRees, Dan Rubenstein, Sandra Zagon, Laszlo Pinter, John Rudolph, Edward\nSchreyer, Susan Sharpe, John McMurtry, Rob Smith, Sara Wilson, Rob Taylor,\nHeather Tischbein, Amy Taylor, Rob Macintosh, Peter Haslett, Joy Hecht,\nJohn Helliwell, Robert Putnam and Raf\u0160 Cavoukian. To all the others whom\nI treasure as friends \u2014 for real wealth is measured in terms of enduring rela-\ntionships.\n\nThis book is intended to inspire both current and future builders of the\nnew economy of well-being in the genuine pursuit of happiness and spiritual\nwell-being. I believe our hearts intuit better ways that are in genuine align-\nment with our core values to design, measure and manage our personal, com-\nmunity and world economies. We know that life is more than consumption\nand having more material possessions. We long to build living economies\nfounded on the premise of well-being that are just, sustainable and \u0161ourish-\ning; a society which is guided by the virtues of love, respect, shared responsi-\nbility, forgiveness, stewardship, cooperation, reciprocity, giving and receiving\nand restorative justice. This book is offered to those hearts and minds alive\nwith understanding the wisdom of the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II, Mother\nTheresa and St. Thomas Aquinas who teach us that love is the ultimate source\nof enduring power in the universe. \n\nMy \u0160nal thanks go to God and the Holy Spirit whose loving kindness\ntaught me to get out of the way of my own ego and sense of knowing and to\nrealize that all things come down to a singular breath: LOVE.\n\nxiv The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xiv\n\n\n\nxv\n\nForeword\nby Herman Daly\n\nSUPPOSE THAT GOD sent an auditor to Earth to review the accounts of indi-\nviduals, \u0160rms, municipalities, and nations, with the purpose of assessing\n\ntheir stewardship of Creation and their success in converting resources into\ngood lives lived abundantly, righteously, and joyfully. What accounts or\nledgers would this auditor want to review, and by what criteria would he\njudge their adequacy? In reading this book I could not help thinking of Mark\nAnielski as \u201cGod\u2019s auditor.\u201d I do not want to attribute to Mark any divine au-\nthority or ability (he certainly does not claim such), nor am I sure that the\nAlmighty would not ask for some parts of the report to be redone. Of course\nan omniscient God has no need of an auditor\u2019s report, and the intended audi-\nence and bene\u0160ciary of the audit is us human beings.\n\nThe main criterion guiding the audit is \u201cgenuine well-being\u201d which is\nderived from \u201cgenuine wealth,\u201d which in turn consists of \u0160ve capital accounts\nthat assess both the quantity and quality of each type of capital. These \u0160ve\ncapitals are: (1) human capital \u2014 individual minds, bodies, spirits and their\ncapabilities; (2) social capital \u2014 quality and strength of our relations in com-\nmunity: trust, honesty, common values, including tolerance; (3) natural capi-\ntal \u2014stocks and funds of things in nature that yield \u0161ows of natural resources\nand life-supporting ecosystem services; (4) built capital \u2014machines, tools,\ndurable consumer goods; (5) \u0160nancial capital \u2014 money and other liquid as-\nsets, fungible and acceptable for payment of transactions and debts.\n\nOur current system of national accounts focuses on (5), pays some atten-\ntion to (4), and ignores (1), (2), and (3). The problem is that it is the \u0160rst three\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xv\n\n\n\nthat are most responsible for genuine well-being. While there is some mar-\nginal substitution possible among these different forms of capital (often\noveremphasized by economists who advise not to worry about depleting, say,\nnatural capital as long as you accumulate an \u201cequal amount\u201d of built capital\nor human capital), it is important to recognize, as Anielski does, that the dif-\nferent forms of capital are mainly complementary. A shortage of any one lim-\nits the productivity of the others. In particular \u0160nancial capital quickly be-\ncomes worthless as natural capital is excessively depleted. And a lack of trust\n(social capital) limits the value of knowledge (human capital), etc. The fact\nthat \u0160nancial capital is the most measurable category has biased our attention\ntoo much in its direction. But just how measurable is money really? Do we\nmean M1, M2, or M3, and what kind of measuring rod is it that can be created\nout of nothing and then destroyed, and while it exists can become longer or\nshorter? We must not make a fetish out of measurability. What really counts\nis often not countable. Assets can be recognized and celebrated and main-\ntained and cared for even if we cannot add and subtract them.\n\nAnielski learns from many people: from Luca Pacioli the Italian inventor\nof double-entry bookkeeping, from Karl-Henrik Robert of the Natural Step,\nand Mathis Wackernagel of the Ecological Footprint analysis, and from many\nothers, including even me, which makes this old professor feel good. He looks\nat examples ranging from Ray Anderson\u2019s Interface Carpet Co. with its eco-\nlogical closed loop materials accounting, to China and the idea of xiaokang, or\nthe\u201cmoderatelywelloff society\u201dasanalternativetotheever-growing economy.\nHe studies the Italian province of Emilia Romagna, the Inuit, Bhutan, and\nthe city of Santa Monica. The style ranges from textbook to personal memoir,\nto philosophical re\u0161ection, but all aimed at elucidating and applying the con-\ncept of Genuine Wealth.\n\nSo, gentle reader, I will take up no more of your time with further sum-\nmary and endorsement. After all, you now have the book in your hands, so by\nall means read it carefully. You will be glad you did.\n\n\u2014 Herman E. Daly\n\nHerman E.

Each of us has our own unique journey in discovering these ultimate\n\nends. But what are the determinants of happiness and our conditions of well-\nbeing \u2014 our genuine wealth? What, as Robert Kennedy challenged, makes\nlife worthwhile? How might we measure our happiness and incorporate these\nmeasures into conventional economic measures of progress like the GDP? \n\nPrompted by such nagging questions I began a journey into the origins\nof economic thought and economic systems. I realized that economics is more\nlike a religion than either art or science. The more I probed its tenets, the\nmore the scales of economic dogma fell from my own eyes and the eyes of\nthose with whom I shared my ideas. In a sense our hearts began to open to\ntruths that have long been sti\u0161ed.\n\nWhile some have de\u0160ned economics as the dismal science, I \u0160nd it akin\nto religion precisely because economic principles and tools form the guidance\nsystem of our modern states. Economists are the high priests of our capitalist\nsystems. I count myself among the economic priesthood \u2014 but I am a priest\nwho longs to understand the very premises and value-origins of our thought.\nAs a professor of business and economics, I have found a hunger among my\nstudents to understand more clearly the articles of faith behind business prac-\ntices. Many students question whether pro\u0160t and \u0160nancial wealth maximiza-\ntion should be the primary goals of business; they long for a more meaningful\nworld where corporations are governed by ethics and principles of social and\nenvironmental responsibility. I am buoyed by this new generation of business\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xvii\n\n\n\nand economic graduates who understand at the heart level that the current\n\u201cnew world order\u201d can and must change.\n\nIn economics we have reduced humanity to a collection of individual, in-\ndependent, utility maximizing creatures. Success is de\u0160ned by the accumula-\ntion of material and \u0160nancial wealth over a lifetime. We are born into this free\nmarket ideology without questioning its morality or ethical foundations. So\nwatermarked is this spirit of economics and capitalism on our lives that even\nthough our hearts cry out for a more meaningful and genuine existence, we\nare sucked back into the squirrel cage of capitalism, running faster and faster\nto \u201ckeep up with the Jones,\u201d lamenting as we imagine a simpler, more mean-\ningful, more genuine life. \n\nI \u0160rmly believe we are at an important tipping point in human history. A\nshared consciousness is emerging which will be supported by enlightened,\nlife-af\u0160rming economics. This book presents my future vision: stewardship of\nwhat I call Genuine Wealth \u2014 those conditions of well-being that align with\nour heartfelt values about what makes life worth living. \n\nThe Economics of Happiness has four primary goals.First, I explore the nature\nand spirit of the current economic system. I want to better understand why\nmany in the sustainability movement can\u2019t seem to move towards a genuine,\nliving and sustainable economic system. I wonder how Adam Smith\u2019s seminal\neconomics text,TheWealth of Nations, failed toconsider theOldEnglishorigins\nof theword\u201cwealth,\u201dwhichliterallymeans\u201ctheconditionsofwell-being.\u201d The\nimportant work of Amitore Fanfani traced economic and capitalistic think-\ning back to the European Middle Ages where Fanfani located a pre-capitalist\nmodel that the sustainability movement may \u0160nd desirable.\n\nMy second goal is to introduce the concept of Genuine Wealth: a new\nand compelling model for managing our personal, household, business and\ncommunity well-being in accordance with the values that de\u0160ne our quality\nof life. Genuine Wealth is a practical system which measures and manages for\nsustainability the total capital assets of a community or organization. Syn-\nthesizing emerging concepts like natural capital and social capital, Genuine\nWealth creates a more comprehensive accounting system where human, so-\ncial, natural, built and \u0160nancial capital are all integrated into the balance sheet.\nThis vision of a living, sustainable economy is founded on the mutually rein-\nforcing and integrated principles of ef\u0160ciency, equity and reciprocity and was\ninspired by the cooperative economy of Emilia Romagna, a \u0161ourishing and\nvibrant region of Italy.\n\nxviii The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xviii\n\n\n\nThirdly I provide examples of applications of the Genuine Wealth model\nat the personal/household, corporate/business, community, state/provincial\nand national scales. I present stories from Nunavut in Canada\u2019s Arctic, the City\nof Santa Monica, California and Leduc, Alberta and explore systems like the US\nGenuine Progress Indicators (GPI) and the Alberta GPI Sustainable Well-\nbeing Accounting System.\n\nFourthly I examine the nature of money and the current debt-based\nbanking system. Mountains of unsustainable debt and the practice of charg-\ning interest on loans actually lead to the destruction of living capital and\nfundamentally undermine sustainable economies of well-being and happi-\nness. I offer examples of alternatives to the current banking systems like the\nJAK Members Bank in Sweden, a cooperative member-owned bank that does\nnot charge interest on loans. I present a Genuine Wealth money and banking\nmodel that returns the power of money creation to the people in community.\nMoney could be created to serve the genuine needs of an economy of happi-\nness, and private banks, by providing wise \u0160nancial counsel to households\nand businesses, could contribute directly to the development of genuine\neconomies of well-being.\n\nWhile there is a growing library of books about sustainability, I offer\nhere a new paradigm which is also a pragmatic system for the management\nand stewardship of the common wealth of nations. While other books might\ndespair at the sad state of the world and our environment, The Economics of\nHappiness holds out hope that a genuine renaissance in economics, accounting\nand business practices is possible and that you and I can build communities of\ngenuine well-being and happiness, a vision that is shared by many. This book\nis optimistic and predicated on faith that people of all nations understand in-\ntuitively what needs to change in order for humanity to move towards a more\nsustainable future.\n\n\u2014 Mark Anielski\n\nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada\n\nIntroduction xix\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xix\n\n\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xx\n\n\n\n1\n\nChapter 1\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth\n\nMany people have asked me \u201chow did you get to where you are?\u201d\nMy professional background includes economics, forestry, accounting\n\nand religious studies. After three university degrees and years working as a\nprofessional economist, I have developed an overview of the ways economic\nsystems operate throughout the world. In my inquiry into economic systems\nI continue to ask the simple question \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Why do economists, \u0160nancial analysts, politicians and media \u0160xate on\ngrowth measures (such as the GDP or gross domestic product) as the key\nindicator of human progress? \n\n\u2022 Why do economy and stock market indices have to keep growing if a com-\nmunity has achieved levels of material self-suf\u0160ciency and quality of life?\n\n\u2022 What is money and where does it come from? \n\u2022 Why is money always scarce? \n\u2022 What\u2019s wrong with a steady-state, subsistence economy which has\n\nachieved suf\u0160ciency and homeostasis? \n\u2022 Why does free-market, capitalist economics look more like a cancer cell\n\nthan the self-renewing life cycle of an ancient forest? \n\u2022 What is driving our more-growth, more-consumption obsession? \n\u2022 Why aren\u2019t economists and our leaders asking hard questions: more\n\ngrowth of what? for whom? \n\nThese are just some of the questions I began to ask myself as an economist\nworking in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a senior government\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 1\n\n\n\neconomic policy analyst at Alberta Environment my primary task was to de-\nrive monetary value for Alberta\u2019s natural capital assets or natural resources;\nmany of them, like wilderness, had no price in a market. I was puzzled that\nwe had to reduce the value of everything to a monetary \u0160gure so it could\ncount. If something had no monetary value \u2014 like the joy of a wilderness ex-\nperience or the sight of a grizzly bear \u2014 did this mean that it was worthless?\nI began questioning the meaning of the word value. I was learning that there\nmight be market and non-market values. Economist and author Marilyn\nWaring offered my \u0160rst plain language lesson in the art of national income ac-\ncounting and the shortcomings of the gross domestic product (GDP) as a\nmeasure of progress.1 Marilyn noted that if you want fantastic GDP growth\nyou would deliberately crash an oil tanker like the Exxon Valdez into an\nAlaskan reef rather than deliver its cargo of oil safely to a Seattle port. Mari-\nlyn was the \u0160rst economist to point out to me the origins of the word value\n(from the Latin valere meaning \u201cshowing worth\u201d). Her warnings about the\nshortcoming of the GNP (the gross national product, the GDP\u2019s cousin) as a\nmeasure of progress had been voiced by Robert Kennedy in 1968 just a few\nweeks before his untimely assassination. Kennedy lamented that while the\nGNP might be great at adding up all the money we spend on goods and serv-\nices in an economy, it was a lousy measure of what mattered most to Ameri-\ncans: their quality of life. No other politician has given such a poignant cri-\ntique of the world\u2019s key measure of progress.2 For me, Kennedy\u2019s rebuke was\na clarion call to research and develop better systems of measuring human\nprogress and well-being that make common sense to average citizens and\nalign with their values.\n\nLearning about natural capital and sustainability\nWith these insights, I began to examine new models for measuring progress,\nsustainability and well-being. I began to explore new methods for accounting\nor measuring sustainability, \u0160rst focused on natural capital and then expand-\ning into other forms of capital accounting including human capital (like\ntime, knowledge and health) and social capital3 (like trust and the strength of\nrelationships). In 1991 I discovered the pioneering work of Robert Repetto at\nthe World Resources Institute in Washington. Repetto argued that account-\nants should treat nature\u2019s capital in the same way they treat manufactured or\nproduced capital like buildings, equipment and computers. Accounting\nshould acknowledge that nature\u2019s capital \u2014 like forests, oil and agricultural\n\n2 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 2\n\n\n\nsoils \u2014 can either depreciate (that is, be depleted or degraded) or appreciate\n(that is, grow in volume or quality). Repetto\u2019s primary argument made good\nsense. I began to ask \u201cwhy don\u2019t we keep a balance sheet for nature\u2019s capital\nassets like forests, oil, gas, coal, wildlife, water and soils that are so vital to\nAlberta\u2019s and Canada\u2019s economy?\u201d I reasoned that economists ignored the\nvalue of nature\u2019s capital either because it was too hard to measure or count or\nbecause it was politically expedient.\n\nWith my curiosity piqued, I began informally examining Alberta\u2019s nat-\nural assets beginning with forests, oil/natural gas and carbon. Were Alberta\u2019s\nforests being managed sustainably? How many years of oil and natural gas\nsupply did Alberta have left? My preliminary results suggested that Alberta\u2019s\nforests might be approaching an unsustainability threshold: more trees were\nbeing harvested and destroyed by \u0160re and insects than the reported annual\ngrowth of the total forest. More disconcertingly, I lacked con\u0160dence in the an-\nnual growth rate of the forest. That was akin to lacking con\u0160dence in the rev-\nenue line on a conventional income statement or the interest rate on my bank\naccount! When I looked at oil and gas natural capital accounts, I was shocked\nto discover that the reserve life or years of future production of conventional\noil and natural gas left, at current production rates, was shrinking rapidly.\nBy my calculations Alberta would exhaust its precious oil and gas reserves\nwithin 12 years without new discoveries. Without information which natural\ncapital accounting provides to guide economic policy decisions, how could\nAlberta decision makers insure the long-term sustainability of Alberta\u2019s nat-\nural capital assets? How could there be so little interest shown in natural cap-\nital accounting practices by a government committed to accountability and\nperformance measurement? \n\nIn constructing these early natural capital accounts I learned an impor-\ntant lesson. While we had mountains of data and information, we seemed to\nlack the wisdom or capacity to understand what all the information was\ntelling us about sustainability. We had lost sight of the forest, so focused were\nwe on making money on the harvesting and export of trees. I realized that\nthere was an important role for accountants and economists to play in devel-\noping new capital accounting tools to assess the long-term sustainability of\nnature\u2019s capital assets as well as human and social capital. Economists could\nbegin developing revised national income accounts and adjusted GDP \u0160gures\nthat counted natural, human and social capital depreciation. I knew that such\naccounts could be constructed from the data we currently collected on the\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 3\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 3\n\n\n\nphysical state of our forests and other natural capital. Yet I knew that, like all\nmajor changes, a move to incorporate natural capital into the balance sheet of\nthe nation would be faced with resistance and reluctance to change. Fortu-\nnately almost 15 years later, the term natural capital has been popularized by\nothers (including by the Canada West Foundation in Calgary). Yet even today\nneither Canada\u2019s nor Alberta\u2019s income accounts or GDP \u0160gures count natural\ncapital assets that are critical to the well-being of Canadians. \n\nSince the early 1990s the idea of natural capitalism \u2014 that nature\u2019s as-\nsets or capital form one of the key foundations of an economy \u2014 has gained\npopularity in many books, countless articles and conferences. Natural Capi-\ntalism by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins contributed to this\ndebate. Its authors suggested that the world is on the verge of a new industri-\nal revolution founded on the principles of a system called natural capitalism.\nThey argued that traditional capitalism has always neglected to assign mone-\ntary value to its largest stock of capital \u2014 namely, the natural resources and\necosystem services that make possible all economic activity and all life. Nat-\nural capitalism, they stated, takes a proper and full accounting of these costs\nand redesigns industry on biological models that result in zero waste, shifts\nthe economy from the episodic acquisition of goods to the continual \u0161ow of\nvalue and service and prudently invests in sustaining and expanding stores of\nnatural capital. These words were music to my ears.4\n\nEncouraged by pioneering reports\nMoving to Alberta Treasury in 1995, I entered an exciting area: measuring\nthe overall performance of the government and the quality of life of Albertans.\nMeasuring Up5 was one of the \u0160rst triple-bottom-line performance reports in\nwhich a government described the conditions (using 24 core indicators) of\npeople, prosperity and preservation (the 3-Ps of progress). Measuring Up ri-\nvaled pioneer quality of life indicators in Oregon (Oregon Benchmarks),\nMinnesota (Minnesota Milestones) and Seattle (Sustainable Seattle). Alberta\nbecame one of Canada\u2019s (indeed North America\u2019s) models for government ac-\ncountability, business planning and performance outcome measurement by\nreporting to citizens on the outcomes of economic, health, social and environ-\nmental progress. The result expanded conventional economic reporting to in-\nclude such indicators as life expectancy, crime rates, educational attainment,\nthe sustainability of forests, the stock of oil and gas resources and the quality\nof air and water. Working with these new performance measurement and pol-\n\n4 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 4\n\n\n\nicy outcome indicators provided a personal opportunity to see the world in all\nits complexity and begin to understand the true meaning of the word wealth.\n\nWe had begun to diagnose the conditions of well-being \u2014 by de\u0160nition\nthe real wealth of Alberta. I realized that if we could account for nature\u2019s cap-\nital through resource accounts, we could also expand our accounting into the\nunchartered waters of human and social capital accounting. I imagined a new\nway of taking inventory and a new expanded balance sheet for our nation,\nprovince, communities and businesses. If we could measure the conditions of\nwell-being of nature\u2019s capital assets, then we could measure the human and\nsocial conditions of our communities. \n\nIn 1997 a most remarkable study landed in my inbox: the US Genuine\nProgress Indicator (GPI). The GPI was developed by a group of researchers in\n1994, led by Cliff Cobb at the San Francisco-based economic policy think\ntank Rede\u0160ning Progress. The GPI is an alternative measure of economic\nprogress that starts with the GDP and makes adjustments for the value of\nunpaid work (e.g. volunteerism and housework) and for various social and\nenvironmental depreciation costs. While the GDP measures growth by the\namount of money exchanged for goods and services in the economy, the GPI\nattempts to measure well-being according to what most people might de\u0160ne\nas progress. For example, while the GDP currently adds things like the \u0160nan-\ncial costs of auto crashes or the social costs of problem gambling, the GPI\nwould deduct these expenditures as regrettable costs. The GPI represented a\nbaby step towards addressing both Robert Kennedy\u2019s and Marilyn Waring\u2019s\nchallenges that measures of progress should re\u0161ect genuine improvements in\nsocietal well-being. Economists could use GPI accounting to contrast GDP\ngrowth with such regrettable trends as the depletion of nonrenewable oil re-\nserves, the health costs associated with air pollution or the cost of failed per-\nsonal relationships. Most of us would consider such costs as regrettable and\nthus deductible as human, social or natural capital depreciation costs against\nnational income. The US GPI results for the period 1950 to 1995 showed a\nremarkable trend: while the GDP and GPI rose in tandem from 1950 to\n1973, the GPI reached its peak in 1973 and then declined steadily even as the\nGDP continued to rise. The economists\u2019 mantra that a rising tide of the GDP\nlifts all economic boats had been soundly repudiated. \n\nAfter reading the US GPI work I knew that my life as an economist\nwould never be the same and that a lifetime of new research and development\nopportunities lay ahead. The US GPI work inspired me to replicate this\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 5\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 5\n\n\n\nimportant well-being measurement in my home province of Alberta and\nthroughout Canada. I dreamed of creating a Rede\u0160ning Progress Canada and\ndedicating my professional life to developing more meaningful tools for\nmeasuring progress and well-being. Sometimes life sends wonderful surprises.\nIn the spring of 1998 Rede\u0160ning Progress asked to interview me for the posi-\ntion of Sustainability Measurement director in San Francisco to oversee future\nUS GPI work. It seemed the opportunity of a lifetime. My wife Jennifer and I\nwere \u0161own down to San Francisco during the Easter long weekend of 1998.\nWined and dined, I was smitten by the idea of working with such a talented\ngroup of creative researchers and living in San Francisco! During my series of\ninterviews with Rede\u0160ning Progress staff I presented my own vision of a\nmore expansive GPI/well-being measurement system that went beyond full-\ncost accounting of regrettable social and environmental costs included in the\nGDP. My vision was to create a system of well-being accounting that would\nmeasure what mattered most to people: their actual physical and qualitative\nconditions of well-being. I reasoned that behind the monetized GPI estimate\nof progress lay people\u2019s real experiences of living which could be measured\nand used to create both a new index of well-being, but more importantly a\nnew well-being accounting and reporting system.\n\nYet, as compelling as the idea of working with Rede\u0160ning Progress in\nSan Francisco was, my own quality of life assessment (comparing the realities\nof the high cost of living in San Francisco with life in Edmonton close to fam-\nily) revealed that Edmonton held a clear quality of life advantage. After many\nlong discussions with Jennifer and with my own full-cost accounting \u0160gures\nin hand, we concluded that a move to San Francisco would likely lead to a net\nloss in our overall family well-being. In the end, our relationship with our\nfamily and friends was more important than moving to a dream job and a\ndream city. Our decision was an important lesson in both my professional and\npersonal life and was a turning point. It brought my professional interest in\nwell-being measurement down to a practical and personal level. We had\nmade our decision about economic well-being based on a review of our values\nand what we felt mattered most to the well-being of our relationship: our\nchildren and our respective families. We had made a decision to stay home, in\nEdmonton \u2014 the community in which I had grown up and which Jennifer\nnow calls home. Our decision was not based on money, income or material\nquality of life but on intangible, qualitative attributes of life that cannot be\neasily quanti\u0160ed. Neither money, material gains nor career advancement\n\n6 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 6\n\n\n\nmeant as much as being close to family, growing old with my grandparents\nand maintaining life-long friendships in Edmonton, North America\u2019s most\npopulous Northern city. I realize now in retrospect that we had made a choice\nbased on my \u0160rst personal Genuine Wealth assessment.\n\nAfter making this important decision, another door opened. Several\nmonths after the trip to San Francisco when I had returned to consulting work,\nI received a call from the woman who had accepted the position at Rede\u0160ning\nProgress. She said that the Ford Foundation (the key funder of the GPI work)\nwould like to see the GPI updated for 1999. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave the skills to do the work. Would you be interested in performing the\nwork on contract and as a Senior Fellow?\u201d I was stunned. The opportunity of\na lifetime had returned. After contemplating the idea for a few days and dis-\ncussing the opportunity with Jennifer, I decided to leave my high-paid posi-\ntion as a senior policy analyst with Government Policy Consultants (GPC)\nInternational and conduct the US GPI work from my home in Edmonton.\nWorking closely with Cliff Cobb and co-author and journalist Jonathan Rowe,\nI completed the US GPI study update by January 1999. This work was a\ndream come true. It was one of the most important turning points in my career,\nopening up new windows of opportunity to work in this exciting and emerg-\ning \u0160eld of real economics.\n\nCompleting the US GPI work turned out to be one of the most challeng-\ning and arduous economic exercises I had ever undertaken. In Washington\nDC, I had the opportunity to meet some of world\u2019s most progressive econo-\nmists at the World Bank, Resources for the Future, World Resources Institute\nand the University of Maryland to discuss their views of the future of GPI-\nstyle accounting. Most were bullish that the GPI was an important measure-\nment effort that should be sustained, but that the model required more\nrigorous quantitative economic analysis to improve the full cost accounting\nestimates and care that the measure not become too value-biased. My most\nmemorable experience was sitting down with Dr. Herman Daly in his tiny\nUniversity of Maryland of\u0160ce. I consider Daly, one of the founding fathers of\nthe transdisciplinary \u0160eld of ecological economics, to be one of the greatest\nliving economists of our time and deserving of a Nobel Prize for economics. I\nasked Herman a question that would change the course of my economics\ncareer: \u201cIs it possible that our efforts at devising a money-denominated indica-\ntor of economic well-being (the GPI) might be futile since we are attempting\nto monetize quality-of-life issues which have value beyond monetary terms?\u201d\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 7\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 7\n\n\n\nDaly responded to my question with enthusiasm and encouraged me to pur-\nsue the answers with all of my life energy. His challenge has shaped my life in\nways I could not have imagined that afternoon sitting across from this hum-\nble, loving and courageous economist. To understand the importance of the\nnature of money and how it is created, Daly encouraged me to read Michael\nRowbotham\u2019s The Grip of Death (the title inspired by the French word mort-\ngage \u2014 meaning \u201ca pledge unto death\u201d) which was one of the most important\nbooks I read on my long journey to discover the nature of money.6 Daly ex-\nplained that over 90% of the world\u2019s money supply was actually created in the\nform of bank debts, not as paper currency created by governments. I then un-\nderstood that GPI-accounting paled in importance to more fundamental\nchanges required in the nature of money creation and banking. I later came to\nsee that the failure of the sustainability movement to understand and address\nthe nature of our debt-based money system would lead to a dead end street,\nsince genuine sustainability, based on principles of material suf\u0160ciency and\nsubsistence, is anathema to the high priests of our debt-money-economic-\ngrowth system.7\n\nIn January of 1999, my co-author Jonathan Rowe (an economic journal-\nist with Rede\u0160ning Progress) released the 1999 update to the US GPI result-\ning in almost no US media attention. The \u0160rst US GPI estimates by Cliff\nCobb, Jonathan Rowe and Ted Halstead in 1995 had won the attention of the\nAtlantic Monthly with a lead article and magazine cover proclaiming \u201cIf the\nGDP is Up, Why is America Down?\u201d8 Other media also inquired into the re-\nsults at that time. With the 1999 update, it seemed that Americans were\nmore intent on levitating stock market indices than on regrettable news of a\nsustained slide in the US GPI.\n\nBeginning the work in Canada\nIf updating the US GPI had been my economic Mt. Everest, my next goal was\ndeveloping a solid and permanent base camp to advance GPI accounting in\nCanada. I wanted to develop Rede\u0160ning Progress Canada and take the origi-\nnal US GPI work to a new level of sophistication and practical application.\nMy friend and former economics thesis advisor, Dr. Michael Percy now Dean\nof the Faculty of Business at the University of Alberta, gave me the chance to\ncreate and run a research think tank at the University of Alberta to explore al-\nternative accounting and measurement systems. What I had hoped to accom-\nplish in San Francisco I would try to do in Canada. I co-founded the Center for\n\n8 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 8\n\n\n\nPerformance Measurement and Management to conduct applied research on\nalternative measures of economic well-being and performance. For two years I\nserved as the center\u2019s Executive Director and co-taught a course in business\nand the environment with Dr. Ray Rasmussen. During my time with the cen-\nter, my vision for expanding the original GPI accounting system took shape.\nThis was the genesis of the Genuine Wealth system. In the winter of 1999 I\ndeveloped a conceptual grand research agenda for creating a transdisciplinary\nnetwork (well-being.net) of University of Alberta\u2019s top researchers to work on\nthe development of a genuine well-being indicators accounting system. My\nmission was to design a sustainability accounting system for Alberta to assess\nthe long-term sustainability of Alberta\u2019s human, social, natural, produced\n(built) and \u0160nancial capital assets. Unfortunately, it soon became apparent\nfrom discussions with senior members of the University of Alberta that creat-\ning a place for such interdisciplinary research would take years of complex\nnegotiation.\n\nFortunately my vision of advancing GPI-sustainable well-being account-\ning caught the attention of Rob Macintosh, the co-founder of the Pembina\nInstitute for Appropriate Development, one of Canada\u2019s premier environmen-\ntal think tanks. In the fall of 1999, Rob encouraged me to join the Pembina\nteam on a part-time basis. I accepted the opportunity and began splitting my\ntime between the University of Alberta and the Pembina Institute. Rob asked\nme to co-author one of many green budget proposals for the National Round\nTable on the Environment and Economy (NRTEE) which would be present-\ned to then Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin for his Budget 2000.\n\nI proposed that NRTEE create a research Center for Applied Sustainable\nEconomics. The proposed center, with a $10 million three-year budget, would\nhave two main goals: \n\n1. To apply improved or innovative methods for measuring the total wealth\nor well-being of Canadians that leads towards economic, ecological and\nsocial sustainability\n\n2. To revise existing \u0160scal policy instruments to help Canada move towards\na future where quality of life and competitive ef\u0160ciency are shared objec-\ntives in a world of ecological limits\n\nMy proposal also included revising national income accounts and the GDP to\nincorporate natural, human and social capital accounts to compliment exist-\ning economic/\u0160nancial accounts.\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 9\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 9\n\n\n\nThe \u0160nal version of the document proposed developing a set of environ-\nment and sustainable development indicators for Canada that would be re-\nported in parallel with other conventional economic indicators of progress.\nTo my surprise, the Chair of the NRTEE Dr. Stuart Smith fully embraced this\nproposal and brought it forward to Finance Minister Martin, who subse-\nquently announced a three-year, nine million dollar initiative in his spring\nBudget 2000. Martin\u2019s remarks as part of this budget presentation shocked\neven the most seasoned policy analysts when he stated:\n\nFinally, as we move to more fully integrate economic and environ-\nmental policy, we must come to grips with the fact that the current\nmeans of measuring progress are inadequate. Therefore, we are an-\nnouncing today that the National Round Table on the Environment\nand the Economy and Environment Canada, in collaboration with\nStatistics Canada, will be provided funding over the next three years\nto develop a set of indicators to measure environmental performance\nin conjunction with economic performance. In the years ahead, these\nenvironmental indicators could well have a greater impact on public policy\nthan any other single measure we might introduce [my emphasis].9\n\nI knew that a new era in economic reporting in Canada had begun. I spent the\nnext three years traveling to Ottawa as Sustainability Measurement Director\nof the Pembina Institute, developing Canada\u2019s \u0160rst set of environment and\nsustainable development indicators. Our work was completed and released in\nMay 2003. The \u0160nal results were somewhat disappointing: only \u0160ve natural\ncapital indicators (forest cover, freshwater quality, air quality, greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions, extent of wetlands) and one human capital indicator (edu-\ncational attainment) would augment familiar economic data, including the\ngross domestic product (GDP) and the consumer price index (CPI). However,\nthe most important outcome was the recommendation that Statistics Canada\nbegin to explore the options for expanding the System of National Accounts\n(from which the GDP is derived) to include more detailed information on\nnatural, human and social capital. If this recommendation was implemented,\nCanada would be the \u0160rst nation in the world to adopt a total capital account-\ning system that could measure the overall sustainability of the nation. Could\nmy recommendation to Paul Martin for a new balance sheet for the nation to\nmeasure the well-being or Genuine Wealth of Canada become a reality? I\n\n10 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 10\n\n\n\nbegan to feel that the possibility existed, given the good fortune my journey\nwas enjoying on a provincial level.\n\nWhile still working part-time at the University of Alberta in January\n2000, I had proposed to Jason Brisbois, senior economist of the federal gov-\nernment department of Western Economic Diversi\u0160cation (WED), and Brant\nPopp, senior policy analyst at WED, a research project to develop the \u0160rst\nprovincial-scale prototype GPI sustainability accounting and measurement\nsystem for the province of Alberta. Both Jason and Brant were enthused by\nthe idea and suggested I submit a formal proposal. At the same time Rob\nMacintosh encouraged me to do this work through the Pembina Institute. I\ndecided to leave the University of Alberta School of Business and form my\nown Pembina Institute sustainability measurement research team. My re-\nsearch project proposal to WED was accepted in April of 2000, and a team of\n\u0160ve researchers at the Pembina Institute began work on the Genuine Progress\nIndicators Pilot Project \u2014 Alberta Case Study: Accounting for Sustainable Develop-\nment. Our goal was to develop a sustainable well-being accounting and report-\ning system with Alberta as the case study. I began to assemble my Alberta\nGPI research team: Amy Taylor (resource economist), Mary Grif\u0160ths (PhD\nmedical geography and scientist), Sara Wilson (ecological economist), Jeff\nWilson (ecological footprint analyst), with guidance from Barbara Campbell\n(accountant). We began by developing a blue-print for the Alberta GPI\naccounts identifying three key domains: economic/\u0160nancial, social/human\nhealth and environmental. Between April of 2000 and March of 2001 our\nPembina team developed 51 economic, social, health and environmental\nwell-being indicators (GPIs) accounting for Alberta\u2019s progress over four\ndecades from 1961 to 1999. We combed hundreds of statistical databases\n(mostly from Statistics Canada) to construct our well-being ledgers. We\nwanted to answer key questions: Has the overall quality of life of Albertan\u2019s\nimproved over forty years? Are we on a sustainable course for our children?\nWe built on the original US GPI full-cost accounting framework, estimating\nthe full costs of environmental, social and human capital values and deprecia-\ntion costs. We also expanded the US GPI model to what I envisioned as a new\nsustainable well-being accounting system with well-being ledgers that\nwould account for the quantitative (statistical data) and qualitative (opinion\ndata) conditions of well-being. Our 51 indicators, which included the GDP,\nwere based on the Alberta Government\u2019s 24 performance indicators for peo-\nple, prosperity and preservation in Measuring Up, plus other indicators that\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 11\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 11\n\n\n\nwe felt would resonate with quality of life issues important to Albertans.\nThese indicators included time spent with family and friends, volunteer time,\nleisure time, income inequality, personal debt levels, divorce rates, disease\nand suicide rates, problem gambling rates and the ecological footprint (a ro-\nbust measure of the sustainability of our individual lifestyles). Our overall\ngoal was to complete a comprehensive well-being checkup of Alberta, as a\ndoctor would complete an annual health checkup. \n\nAfter many long nights of research, number crunching and analysis we\nreleased the Alberta GPI report on Monday morning, April 23, 2001. Titled\nAlberta Sustainability Trends 2000: The Genuine Progress Indicators Report 1961\nto 1999, our report hit a home run in terms of media coverage. It made the\nfront pages of Canada\u2019s national newspaper, the Globe and Mail, on April 23,\n2001 with the title \u201cFat Cat Albertans Struggle with Happiness\u201d and the\nfront page of the Edmonton Journal with the title \u201cAlberta\u2019s Natural Capital\nSlipping.\u201d I was stunned by the media attention. The phone rang off the hook\nthat day. I was interviewed for CBC television\u2019s nightly newscast The National\nbroadcast on both French and English television channels. Radio interviews\nincluded Alberta-broadcast CHED 630 radio and CBC radio in Montreal and\nWhitehorse. After an exhausting media-frenzied day, I knew that we had\ntapped into a deep current of public consciousness. The average Albertan un-\nderstood that real progress should be measured by more than an increment in\nthe GDP or stock market indices. We had put a quality-of-life-reality-mirror\nup to the GDP using a Genuine Progress Index that revealed that while\nAlberta\u2019s GDP had risen an average 4.4 percent per year over the period 1960\nto 1999, the more comprehensive Genuine Progress Index had declined at an\naverage rate of 0.5 percent during the same period. Indeed, throughout the\n1980s and 1990s the GPI was virtually stagnant as the GDP continued its as-\ncent. The economic credo that a rising tide of the GDP lifts all boats had been\nrepudiated again.\n\nOur results were not unlike the US GPI study. Although Alberta\u2019s Gen-\nuine Progress Index had remained relatively steady throughout the 1980s\nand 1990s, the US GPI had been in steady decline since the mid 1970s. The\nGPI well-being diagnosis also revealed that the average real (de\u0161ated for in-\n\u0161ation) disposable incomes of average Albertans had stagnated since 1981\neven as the GDP continued to rise through to 1999. Most Albertans could re-\nlate to this reality. Other regrettable economic and social trends included ris-\ning rates of suicide, divorce, problem gambling and personal debt. Many of\n\n12 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 12\n\n\n\nthe environmental indicators also showed negative trends including declin-\ning oil and gas reserves, massive fragmentation of forest ecosystem and rising\nlevels of toxic waste production.\n\nOur report sustained media and public attention for several weeks. I was\ninvited to speak at numerous conferences about our \u0160ndings. We had provid-\ned the basis of an important dialogue in Alberta addressing economist Stanley\nK\u00fcznets\u2019 challenge: more growth of what and for whom? Interesting, but not\nsurprising, was the lack of any formal response from the Alberta Government\nand most notably from Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. Klein\u2019s response was\nsimply that we were entitled to our own view of progress \u2014 a compliment\ngiven his penchant for polemic outbursts. The relative silence from the\nAlberta Government suggested that our longitudinal well-being check-up of\nAlberta\u2019s economic, social and environmental progress was relatively fair and\naccurate. Our report had its critics, primarily economists who argued that the\ncreation of a composite well-being index was fraught with methodological\nproblems, including indicator selection biases and giving all indicators equal\nweight.

He shares insights gained from various roles in economic policy and consulting, which led him to question traditional measures of progress like GDP and explore more holistic and meaningful metrics.\n\n### Chapter 3: What\u2019s Wrong with the Picture of Progress\n**Key Idea**: Traditional economic indicators such as GDP fail to account for real quality of life and sustainability.\n**Summary**: Anielski critiques traditional measures of progress, particularly GDP, which he argues paints an incomplete picture by ignoring important aspects like environmental degradation and social costs. He introduces alternative metrics like the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), which attempts to provide a more accurate reflection of true progress by accounting for both economic activity and social and environmental health.\n\n### Chapter 4: A Renaissance in Economics and Capitalism\n**Key Idea**: A rethinking of capitalism and economics is necessary to align them more closely with human and ecological well-being.\n**Summary**: This chapter discusses historical and philosophical bases for a transformation in economic thought and practice. Anielski explores how ancient and medieval economic practices, which focused more on moderation and sustainability, can inform modern capitalism. He suggests that a renaissance in economics would involve integrating ethics and recognizing the interdependence of economic activities with social and ecological systems.\n\n### Chapter 5: The Genuine Wealth Model\n**Key Idea**: The Genuine Wealth Model is a holistic approach to measure the well-being of individuals and communities.\n**Summary**: Anielski introduces the Genuine Wealth Model, which assesses the health of five types of capital: human, social, natural, built, and financial. This model is designed to help communities and nations measure and manage their resources for sustainable development, reflecting a broader definition of wealth that includes well-being and happiness.\n\n### Chapter 7: The Genuine Wealth of Communities and Nations\n**Key Idea**: The real wealth of communities and nations lies in their ability to sustain and improve the well-being of their citizens.\n**Summary**: This chapter examines how different communities and nations measure and perceive their wealth. Anielski presents case studies from various places that have implemented the Genuine Wealth Model, showing how it has led to better policy decisions and improved community well-being. He argues for a shift from wealth measured purely in financial terms to one that values social, human, and environmental health equally.\n\nThese summaries offer a glimpse into Anielski&#x27;s comprehensive approach to redefining wealth and economic success through more inclusive and realistic metrics."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

While studying this week, I noticed that there was no shortage of metrics or projects like the Happy Planet Index measuring or quantifying the effects of social and environmental practices on a national level.

Are any key stakeholders and decision-makers paying careful attention to this data and allowing it to inform policy?

Until now there has been no full-scale\nstudy demonstrating this and developing a more appropriate alternative.\nWith The Economics of Happiness, the last shred of justification for the exclusive\nfocus on market activity is gone.

Peter, an immigrant to\nCanada from Austria in the early 1920s, was a gardener all his life. He under-\nstood what made life worthwhile: the value of time spent with those he loved\nand in the many gardens he nurtured.\n\nTo my parents, Hans-Ulrich and Mary Ann Anielski, who taught me\nhow to dream and act on my dreams with conviction and leadership. They\ntaught me about how to live a life of faith, love, meaningful relationships and\nabout the virtue of meaningful, life-giving work as vocation. \n\nTo my life partner and wife, Jennifer Haslett, who has taught me the joys\nof love and reciprocal relationship; of reconciliation, laughter and most im-\nportantly of open and honest dialogue. And to our two daughters Ren\u00e9e and\nStephanie, who teach me every day about unconditional love and real hap-\npiness. Like my Opa and our elders, my children are teaching me how to\ncelebrate life in the moment of experience and how to breathe love in each\nprecious second of living. Children have a remarkable gift for asking tough\nquestions; this book is dedicated to answering some of those questions which\nstill linger into adulthood.\n\nLike the book of life, this book is the result of years of many wonderful\nconversations and enduring relationships with friends and colleagues around\nthe world. I would like to thank David Korten for encouraging me to write\nthis book and my students at Bainbridge Graduate Institute near Seattle,\nespecially Kate Kaemerle who took the \u0160rst steps with me on this journey by\ncompelling me to \u201cwrite it down, Mark!\u201d To Chris and Judith Plant and\nIngrid Witvoet of New Society Publishers for believing in my message. To\nBetsy Nuse, my wonderful editor whose loving edits have helped shape this\nbook into a crystal of wisdom. To Sue Custance and Diane McIntosh for the\nexquisite cover design that adorns this book, including the idea for a\n\nxiii\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/26/2007  12:21 PM  Page xiii\n\n\n\nFibonnaci sequence which is the golden ratio revealed in nature especially\n\u0161owers. To Jane Haslett, my mother-in-law whose unwavering dedication to\nthe initial edits of this book and her wonderful encouragement continually\nbuoyed my spirit. And to many other friends and colleagues who have in-\nspired and shared in my spiritual and earthly journey including Judi Hoyt,\nRobertFelty,AaronBraaten,AnitaBurke, JoeyHundert,MichaelHaynes,Bill\nHarder, Ernie Zelinski, Orest Andre, Dominic Misho, Boudewijn Wegerif\n(deceased), Jeff Wilson, Kelvin Hirsch, Randy Hirsch, Steve Janzen, Derek\nRasmussen, Pat Klak, Bernard Lietaer, Libba and Gifford Pinchot III, Pat\nCarmack, Mel Hurtig, Oscar Kjellberg, Karl-Heinrik Robert, Leslie Christ-\nian, Bob Willard, Bob Williams, Herman Daly, John Cobb Jr., Ken Chap-\nman, Marilyn Waring, Hazel Henderson, Janine Benyus, Linda McQuaig,\nHarold Wynne, Brian and Mary Nattrass, Michael Percy, Colin Soskolne, Bill\nRees, Dan Rubenstein, Sandra Zagon, Laszlo Pinter, John Rudolph, Edward\nSchreyer, Susan Sharpe, John McMurtry, Rob Smith, Sara Wilson, Rob Taylor,\nHeather Tischbein, Amy Taylor, Rob Macintosh, Peter Haslett, Joy Hecht,\nJohn Helliwell, Robert Putnam and Raf\u0160 Cavoukian. To all the others whom\nI treasure as friends \u2014 for real wealth is measured in terms of enduring rela-\ntionships.\n\nThis book is intended to inspire both current and future builders of the\nnew economy of well-being in the genuine pursuit of happiness and spiritual\nwell-being. I believe our hearts intuit better ways that are in genuine align-\nment with our core values to design, measure and manage our personal, com-\nmunity and world economies. We know that life is more than consumption\nand having more material possessions. We long to build living economies\nfounded on the premise of well-being that are just, sustainable and \u0161ourish-\ning; a society which is guided by the virtues of love, respect, shared responsi-\nbility, forgiveness, stewardship, cooperation, reciprocity, giving and receiving\nand restorative justice. This book is offered to those hearts and minds alive\nwith understanding the wisdom of the Dalai Lama, Pope John Paul II, Mother\nTheresa and St. Thomas Aquinas who teach us that love is the ultimate source\nof enduring power in the universe. \n\nMy \u0160nal thanks go to God and the Holy Spirit whose loving kindness\ntaught me to get out of the way of my own ego and sense of knowing and to\nrealize that all things come down to a singular breath: LOVE.\n\nxiv The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xiv\n\n\n\nxv\n\nForeword\nby Herman Daly\n\nSUPPOSE THAT GOD sent an auditor to Earth to review the accounts of indi-\nviduals, \u0160rms, municipalities, and nations, with the purpose of assessing\n\ntheir stewardship of Creation and their success in converting resources into\ngood lives lived abundantly, righteously, and joyfully. What accounts or\nledgers would this auditor want to review, and by what criteria would he\njudge their adequacy? In reading this book I could not help thinking of Mark\nAnielski as \u201cGod\u2019s auditor.\u201d I do not want to attribute to Mark any divine au-\nthority or ability (he certainly does not claim such), nor am I sure that the\nAlmighty would not ask for some parts of the report to be redone. Of course\nan omniscient God has no need of an auditor\u2019s report, and the intended audi-\nence and bene\u0160ciary of the audit is us human beings.\n\nThe main criterion guiding the audit is \u201cgenuine well-being\u201d which is\nderived from \u201cgenuine wealth,\u201d which in turn consists of \u0160ve capital accounts\nthat assess both the quantity and quality of each type of capital. These \u0160ve\ncapitals are: (1) human capital \u2014 individual minds, bodies, spirits and their\ncapabilities; (2) social capital \u2014 quality and strength of our relations in com-\nmunity: trust, honesty, common values, including tolerance; (3) natural capi-\ntal \u2014stocks and funds of things in nature that yield \u0161ows of natural resources\nand life-supporting ecosystem services; (4) built capital \u2014machines, tools,\ndurable consumer goods; (5) \u0160nancial capital \u2014 money and other liquid as-\nsets, fungible and acceptable for payment of transactions and debts.\n\nOur current system of national accounts focuses on (5), pays some atten-\ntion to (4), and ignores (1), (2), and (3). The problem is that it is the \u0160rst three\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xv\n\n\n\nthat are most responsible for genuine well-being. While there is some mar-\nginal substitution possible among these different forms of capital (often\noveremphasized by economists who advise not to worry about depleting, say,\nnatural capital as long as you accumulate an \u201cequal amount\u201d of built capital\nor human capital), it is important to recognize, as Anielski does, that the dif-\nferent forms of capital are mainly complementary. A shortage of any one lim-\nits the productivity of the others. In particular \u0160nancial capital quickly be-\ncomes worthless as natural capital is excessively depleted. And a lack of trust\n(social capital) limits the value of knowledge (human capital), etc. The fact\nthat \u0160nancial capital is the most measurable category has biased our attention\ntoo much in its direction. But just how measurable is money really? Do we\nmean M1, M2, or M3, and what kind of measuring rod is it that can be created\nout of nothing and then destroyed, and while it exists can become longer or\nshorter? We must not make a fetish out of measurability. What really counts\nis often not countable. Assets can be recognized and celebrated and main-\ntained and cared for even if we cannot add and subtract them.\n\nAnielski learns from many people: from Luca Pacioli the Italian inventor\nof double-entry bookkeeping, from Karl-Henrik Robert of the Natural Step,\nand Mathis Wackernagel of the Ecological Footprint analysis, and from many\nothers, including even me, which makes this old professor feel good. He looks\nat examples ranging from Ray Anderson\u2019s Interface Carpet Co. with its eco-\nlogical closed loop materials accounting, to China and the idea of xiaokang, or\nthe\u201cmoderatelywelloff society\u201dasanalternativetotheever-growing economy.\nHe studies the Italian province of Emilia Romagna, the Inuit, Bhutan, and\nthe city of Santa Monica. The style ranges from textbook to personal memoir,\nto philosophical re\u0161ection, but all aimed at elucidating and applying the con-\ncept of Genuine Wealth.\n\nSo, gentle reader, I will take up no more of your time with further sum-\nmary and endorsement. After all, you now have the book in your hands, so by\nall means read it carefully. You will be glad you did.\n\n\u2014 Herman E. Daly\n\nHerman E.

Each of us has our own unique journey in discovering these ultimate\n\nends. But what are the determinants of happiness and our conditions of well-\nbeing \u2014 our genuine wealth? What, as Robert Kennedy challenged, makes\nlife worthwhile? How might we measure our happiness and incorporate these\nmeasures into conventional economic measures of progress like the GDP? \n\nPrompted by such nagging questions I began a journey into the origins\nof economic thought and economic systems. I realized that economics is more\nlike a religion than either art or science. The more I probed its tenets, the\nmore the scales of economic dogma fell from my own eyes and the eyes of\nthose with whom I shared my ideas. In a sense our hearts began to open to\ntruths that have long been sti\u0161ed.\n\nWhile some have de\u0160ned economics as the dismal science, I \u0160nd it akin\nto religion precisely because economic principles and tools form the guidance\nsystem of our modern states. Economists are the high priests of our capitalist\nsystems. I count myself among the economic priesthood \u2014 but I am a priest\nwho longs to understand the very premises and value-origins of our thought.\nAs a professor of business and economics, I have found a hunger among my\nstudents to understand more clearly the articles of faith behind business prac-\ntices. Many students question whether pro\u0160t and \u0160nancial wealth maximiza-\ntion should be the primary goals of business; they long for a more meaningful\nworld where corporations are governed by ethics and principles of social and\nenvironmental responsibility. I am buoyed by this new generation of business\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xvii\n\n\n\nand economic graduates who understand at the heart level that the current\n\u201cnew world order\u201d can and must change.\n\nIn economics we have reduced humanity to a collection of individual, in-\ndependent, utility maximizing creatures. Success is de\u0160ned by the accumula-\ntion of material and \u0160nancial wealth over a lifetime. We are born into this free\nmarket ideology without questioning its morality or ethical foundations. So\nwatermarked is this spirit of economics and capitalism on our lives that even\nthough our hearts cry out for a more meaningful and genuine existence, we\nare sucked back into the squirrel cage of capitalism, running faster and faster\nto \u201ckeep up with the Jones,\u201d lamenting as we imagine a simpler, more mean-\ningful, more genuine life. \n\nI \u0160rmly believe we are at an important tipping point in human history. A\nshared consciousness is emerging which will be supported by enlightened,\nlife-af\u0160rming economics. This book presents my future vision: stewardship of\nwhat I call Genuine Wealth \u2014 those conditions of well-being that align with\nour heartfelt values about what makes life worth living. \n\nThe Economics of Happiness has four primary goals.First, I explore the nature\nand spirit of the current economic system. I want to better understand why\nmany in the sustainability movement can\u2019t seem to move towards a genuine,\nliving and sustainable economic system. I wonder how Adam Smith\u2019s seminal\neconomics text,TheWealth of Nations, failed toconsider theOldEnglishorigins\nof theword\u201cwealth,\u201dwhichliterallymeans\u201ctheconditionsofwell-being.\u201d The\nimportant work of Amitore Fanfani traced economic and capitalistic think-\ning back to the European Middle Ages where Fanfani located a pre-capitalist\nmodel that the sustainability movement may \u0160nd desirable.\n\nMy second goal is to introduce the concept of Genuine Wealth: a new\nand compelling model for managing our personal, household, business and\ncommunity well-being in accordance with the values that de\u0160ne our quality\nof life. Genuine Wealth is a practical system which measures and manages for\nsustainability the total capital assets of a community or organization. Syn-\nthesizing emerging concepts like natural capital and social capital, Genuine\nWealth creates a more comprehensive accounting system where human, so-\ncial, natural, built and \u0160nancial capital are all integrated into the balance sheet.\nThis vision of a living, sustainable economy is founded on the mutually rein-\nforcing and integrated principles of ef\u0160ciency, equity and reciprocity and was\ninspired by the cooperative economy of Emilia Romagna, a \u0161ourishing and\nvibrant region of Italy.\n\nxviii The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xviii\n\n\n\nThirdly I provide examples of applications of the Genuine Wealth model\nat the personal/household, corporate/business, community, state/provincial\nand national scales. I present stories from Nunavut in Canada\u2019s Arctic, the City\nof Santa Monica, California and Leduc, Alberta and explore systems like the US\nGenuine Progress Indicators (GPI) and the Alberta GPI Sustainable Well-\nbeing Accounting System.\n\nFourthly I examine the nature of money and the current debt-based\nbanking system. Mountains of unsustainable debt and the practice of charg-\ning interest on loans actually lead to the destruction of living capital and\nfundamentally undermine sustainable economies of well-being and happi-\nness. I offer examples of alternatives to the current banking systems like the\nJAK Members Bank in Sweden, a cooperative member-owned bank that does\nnot charge interest on loans. I present a Genuine Wealth money and banking\nmodel that returns the power of money creation to the people in community.\nMoney could be created to serve the genuine needs of an economy of happi-\nness, and private banks, by providing wise \u0160nancial counsel to households\nand businesses, could contribute directly to the development of genuine\neconomies of well-being.\n\nWhile there is a growing library of books about sustainability, I offer\nhere a new paradigm which is also a pragmatic system for the management\nand stewardship of the common wealth of nations. While other books might\ndespair at the sad state of the world and our environment, The Economics of\nHappiness holds out hope that a genuine renaissance in economics, accounting\nand business practices is possible and that you and I can build communities of\ngenuine well-being and happiness, a vision that is shared by many. This book\nis optimistic and predicated on faith that people of all nations understand in-\ntuitively what needs to change in order for humanity to move towards a more\nsustainable future.\n\n\u2014 Mark Anielski\n\nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada\n\nIntroduction xix\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xix\n\n\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page xx\n\n\n\n1\n\nChapter 1\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth\n\nMany people have asked me \u201chow did you get to where you are?\u201d\nMy professional background includes economics, forestry, accounting\n\nand religious studies. After three university degrees and years working as a\nprofessional economist, I have developed an overview of the ways economic\nsystems operate throughout the world. In my inquiry into economic systems\nI continue to ask the simple question \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Why do economists, \u0160nancial analysts, politicians and media \u0160xate on\ngrowth measures (such as the GDP or gross domestic product) as the key\nindicator of human progress? \n\n\u2022 Why do economy and stock market indices have to keep growing if a com-\nmunity has achieved levels of material self-suf\u0160ciency and quality of life?\n\n\u2022 What is money and where does it come from? \n\u2022 Why is money always scarce? \n\u2022 What\u2019s wrong with a steady-state, subsistence economy which has\n\nachieved suf\u0160ciency and homeostasis? \n\u2022 Why does free-market, capitalist economics look more like a cancer cell\n\nthan the self-renewing life cycle of an ancient forest? \n\u2022 What is driving our more-growth, more-consumption obsession? \n\u2022 Why aren\u2019t economists and our leaders asking hard questions: more\n\ngrowth of what? for whom? \n\nThese are just some of the questions I began to ask myself as an economist\nworking in the Canadian province of Alberta. As a senior government\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 1\n\n\n\neconomic policy analyst at Alberta Environment my primary task was to de-\nrive monetary value for Alberta\u2019s natural capital assets or natural resources;\nmany of them, like wilderness, had no price in a market. I was puzzled that\nwe had to reduce the value of everything to a monetary \u0160gure so it could\ncount. If something had no monetary value \u2014 like the joy of a wilderness ex-\nperience or the sight of a grizzly bear \u2014 did this mean that it was worthless?\nI began questioning the meaning of the word value. I was learning that there\nmight be market and non-market values. Economist and author Marilyn\nWaring offered my \u0160rst plain language lesson in the art of national income ac-\ncounting and the shortcomings of the gross domestic product (GDP) as a\nmeasure of progress.1 Marilyn noted that if you want fantastic GDP growth\nyou would deliberately crash an oil tanker like the Exxon Valdez into an\nAlaskan reef rather than deliver its cargo of oil safely to a Seattle port. Mari-\nlyn was the \u0160rst economist to point out to me the origins of the word value\n(from the Latin valere meaning \u201cshowing worth\u201d). Her warnings about the\nshortcoming of the GNP (the gross national product, the GDP\u2019s cousin) as a\nmeasure of progress had been voiced by Robert Kennedy in 1968 just a few\nweeks before his untimely assassination. Kennedy lamented that while the\nGNP might be great at adding up all the money we spend on goods and serv-\nices in an economy, it was a lousy measure of what mattered most to Ameri-\ncans: their quality of life. No other politician has given such a poignant cri-\ntique of the world\u2019s key measure of progress.2 For me, Kennedy\u2019s rebuke was\na clarion call to research and develop better systems of measuring human\nprogress and well-being that make common sense to average citizens and\nalign with their values.\n\nLearning about natural capital and sustainability\nWith these insights, I began to examine new models for measuring progress,\nsustainability and well-being. I began to explore new methods for accounting\nor measuring sustainability, \u0160rst focused on natural capital and then expand-\ning into other forms of capital accounting including human capital (like\ntime, knowledge and health) and social capital3 (like trust and the strength of\nrelationships). In 1991 I discovered the pioneering work of Robert Repetto at\nthe World Resources Institute in Washington. Repetto argued that account-\nants should treat nature\u2019s capital in the same way they treat manufactured or\nproduced capital like buildings, equipment and computers. Accounting\nshould acknowledge that nature\u2019s capital \u2014 like forests, oil and agricultural\n\n2 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 2\n\n\n\nsoils \u2014 can either depreciate (that is, be depleted or degraded) or appreciate\n(that is, grow in volume or quality). Repetto\u2019s primary argument made good\nsense. I began to ask \u201cwhy don\u2019t we keep a balance sheet for nature\u2019s capital\nassets like forests, oil, gas, coal, wildlife, water and soils that are so vital to\nAlberta\u2019s and Canada\u2019s economy?\u201d I reasoned that economists ignored the\nvalue of nature\u2019s capital either because it was too hard to measure or count or\nbecause it was politically expedient.\n\nWith my curiosity piqued, I began informally examining Alberta\u2019s nat-\nural assets beginning with forests, oil/natural gas and carbon. Were Alberta\u2019s\nforests being managed sustainably? How many years of oil and natural gas\nsupply did Alberta have left? My preliminary results suggested that Alberta\u2019s\nforests might be approaching an unsustainability threshold: more trees were\nbeing harvested and destroyed by \u0160re and insects than the reported annual\ngrowth of the total forest. More disconcertingly, I lacked con\u0160dence in the an-\nnual growth rate of the forest. That was akin to lacking con\u0160dence in the rev-\nenue line on a conventional income statement or the interest rate on my bank\naccount! When I looked at oil and gas natural capital accounts, I was shocked\nto discover that the reserve life or years of future production of conventional\noil and natural gas left, at current production rates, was shrinking rapidly.\nBy my calculations Alberta would exhaust its precious oil and gas reserves\nwithin 12 years without new discoveries. Without information which natural\ncapital accounting provides to guide economic policy decisions, how could\nAlberta decision makers insure the long-term sustainability of Alberta\u2019s nat-\nural capital assets? How could there be so little interest shown in natural cap-\nital accounting practices by a government committed to accountability and\nperformance measurement? \n\nIn constructing these early natural capital accounts I learned an impor-\ntant lesson. While we had mountains of data and information, we seemed to\nlack the wisdom or capacity to understand what all the information was\ntelling us about sustainability. We had lost sight of the forest, so focused were\nwe on making money on the harvesting and export of trees. I realized that\nthere was an important role for accountants and economists to play in devel-\noping new capital accounting tools to assess the long-term sustainability of\nnature\u2019s capital assets as well as human and social capital. Economists could\nbegin developing revised national income accounts and adjusted GDP \u0160gures\nthat counted natural, human and social capital depreciation. I knew that such\naccounts could be constructed from the data we currently collected on the\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 3\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 3\n\n\n\nphysical state of our forests and other natural capital. Yet I knew that, like all\nmajor changes, a move to incorporate natural capital into the balance sheet of\nthe nation would be faced with resistance and reluctance to change. Fortu-\nnately almost 15 years later, the term natural capital has been popularized by\nothers (including by the Canada West Foundation in Calgary). Yet even today\nneither Canada\u2019s nor Alberta\u2019s income accounts or GDP \u0160gures count natural\ncapital assets that are critical to the well-being of Canadians. \n\nSince the early 1990s the idea of natural capitalism \u2014 that nature\u2019s as-\nsets or capital form one of the key foundations of an economy \u2014 has gained\npopularity in many books, countless articles and conferences. Natural Capi-\ntalism by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins contributed to this\ndebate. Its authors suggested that the world is on the verge of a new industri-\nal revolution founded on the principles of a system called natural capitalism.\nThey argued that traditional capitalism has always neglected to assign mone-\ntary value to its largest stock of capital \u2014 namely, the natural resources and\necosystem services that make possible all economic activity and all life. Nat-\nural capitalism, they stated, takes a proper and full accounting of these costs\nand redesigns industry on biological models that result in zero waste, shifts\nthe economy from the episodic acquisition of goods to the continual \u0161ow of\nvalue and service and prudently invests in sustaining and expanding stores of\nnatural capital. These words were music to my ears.4\n\nEncouraged by pioneering reports\nMoving to Alberta Treasury in 1995, I entered an exciting area: measuring\nthe overall performance of the government and the quality of life of Albertans.\nMeasuring Up5 was one of the \u0160rst triple-bottom-line performance reports in\nwhich a government described the conditions (using 24 core indicators) of\npeople, prosperity and preservation (the 3-Ps of progress). Measuring Up ri-\nvaled pioneer quality of life indicators in Oregon (Oregon Benchmarks),\nMinnesota (Minnesota Milestones) and Seattle (Sustainable Seattle). Alberta\nbecame one of Canada\u2019s (indeed North America\u2019s) models for government ac-\ncountability, business planning and performance outcome measurement by\nreporting to citizens on the outcomes of economic, health, social and environ-\nmental progress. The result expanded conventional economic reporting to in-\nclude such indicators as life expectancy, crime rates, educational attainment,\nthe sustainability of forests, the stock of oil and gas resources and the quality\nof air and water. Working with these new performance measurement and pol-\n\n4 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 4\n\n\n\nicy outcome indicators provided a personal opportunity to see the world in all\nits complexity and begin to understand the true meaning of the word wealth.\n\nWe had begun to diagnose the conditions of well-being \u2014 by de\u0160nition\nthe real wealth of Alberta. I realized that if we could account for nature\u2019s cap-\nital through resource accounts, we could also expand our accounting into the\nunchartered waters of human and social capital accounting. I imagined a new\nway of taking inventory and a new expanded balance sheet for our nation,\nprovince, communities and businesses. If we could measure the conditions of\nwell-being of nature\u2019s capital assets, then we could measure the human and\nsocial conditions of our communities. \n\nIn 1997 a most remarkable study landed in my inbox: the US Genuine\nProgress Indicator (GPI). The GPI was developed by a group of researchers in\n1994, led by Cliff Cobb at the San Francisco-based economic policy think\ntank Rede\u0160ning Progress. The GPI is an alternative measure of economic\nprogress that starts with the GDP and makes adjustments for the value of\nunpaid work (e.g. volunteerism and housework) and for various social and\nenvironmental depreciation costs. While the GDP measures growth by the\namount of money exchanged for goods and services in the economy, the GPI\nattempts to measure well-being according to what most people might de\u0160ne\nas progress. For example, while the GDP currently adds things like the \u0160nan-\ncial costs of auto crashes or the social costs of problem gambling, the GPI\nwould deduct these expenditures as regrettable costs. The GPI represented a\nbaby step towards addressing both Robert Kennedy\u2019s and Marilyn Waring\u2019s\nchallenges that measures of progress should re\u0161ect genuine improvements in\nsocietal well-being. Economists could use GPI accounting to contrast GDP\ngrowth with such regrettable trends as the depletion of nonrenewable oil re-\nserves, the health costs associated with air pollution or the cost of failed per-\nsonal relationships. Most of us would consider such costs as regrettable and\nthus deductible as human, social or natural capital depreciation costs against\nnational income. The US GPI results for the period 1950 to 1995 showed a\nremarkable trend: while the GDP and GPI rose in tandem from 1950 to\n1973, the GPI reached its peak in 1973 and then declined steadily even as the\nGDP continued to rise. The economists\u2019 mantra that a rising tide of the GDP\nlifts all economic boats had been soundly repudiated. \n\nAfter reading the US GPI work I knew that my life as an economist\nwould never be the same and that a lifetime of new research and development\nopportunities lay ahead. The US GPI work inspired me to replicate this\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 5\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 5\n\n\n\nimportant well-being measurement in my home province of Alberta and\nthroughout Canada. I dreamed of creating a Rede\u0160ning Progress Canada and\ndedicating my professional life to developing more meaningful tools for\nmeasuring progress and well-being. Sometimes life sends wonderful surprises.\nIn the spring of 1998 Rede\u0160ning Progress asked to interview me for the posi-\ntion of Sustainability Measurement director in San Francisco to oversee future\nUS GPI work. It seemed the opportunity of a lifetime. My wife Jennifer and I\nwere \u0161own down to San Francisco during the Easter long weekend of 1998.\nWined and dined, I was smitten by the idea of working with such a talented\ngroup of creative researchers and living in San Francisco! During my series of\ninterviews with Rede\u0160ning Progress staff I presented my own vision of a\nmore expansive GPI/well-being measurement system that went beyond full-\ncost accounting of regrettable social and environmental costs included in the\nGDP. My vision was to create a system of well-being accounting that would\nmeasure what mattered most to people: their actual physical and qualitative\nconditions of well-being. I reasoned that behind the monetized GPI estimate\nof progress lay people\u2019s real experiences of living which could be measured\nand used to create both a new index of well-being, but more importantly a\nnew well-being accounting and reporting system.\n\nYet, as compelling as the idea of working with Rede\u0160ning Progress in\nSan Francisco was, my own quality of life assessment (comparing the realities\nof the high cost of living in San Francisco with life in Edmonton close to fam-\nily) revealed that Edmonton held a clear quality of life advantage. After many\nlong discussions with Jennifer and with my own full-cost accounting \u0160gures\nin hand, we concluded that a move to San Francisco would likely lead to a net\nloss in our overall family well-being. In the end, our relationship with our\nfamily and friends was more important than moving to a dream job and a\ndream city. Our decision was an important lesson in both my professional and\npersonal life and was a turning point. It brought my professional interest in\nwell-being measurement down to a practical and personal level. We had\nmade our decision about economic well-being based on a review of our values\nand what we felt mattered most to the well-being of our relationship: our\nchildren and our respective families. We had made a decision to stay home, in\nEdmonton \u2014 the community in which I had grown up and which Jennifer\nnow calls home. Our decision was not based on money, income or material\nquality of life but on intangible, qualitative attributes of life that cannot be\neasily quanti\u0160ed. Neither money, material gains nor career advancement\n\n6 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 6\n\n\n\nmeant as much as being close to family, growing old with my grandparents\nand maintaining life-long friendships in Edmonton, North America\u2019s most\npopulous Northern city. I realize now in retrospect that we had made a choice\nbased on my \u0160rst personal Genuine Wealth assessment.\n\nAfter making this important decision, another door opened. Several\nmonths after the trip to San Francisco when I had returned to consulting work,\nI received a call from the woman who had accepted the position at Rede\u0160ning\nProgress. She said that the Ford Foundation (the key funder of the GPI work)\nwould like to see the GPI updated for 1999. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave the skills to do the work. Would you be interested in performing the\nwork on contract and as a Senior Fellow?\u201d I was stunned. The opportunity of\na lifetime had returned. After contemplating the idea for a few days and dis-\ncussing the opportunity with Jennifer, I decided to leave my high-paid posi-\ntion as a senior policy analyst with Government Policy Consultants (GPC)\nInternational and conduct the US GPI work from my home in Edmonton.\nWorking closely with Cliff Cobb and co-author and journalist Jonathan Rowe,\nI completed the US GPI study update by January 1999. This work was a\ndream come true. It was one of the most important turning points in my career,\nopening up new windows of opportunity to work in this exciting and emerg-\ning \u0160eld of real economics.\n\nCompleting the US GPI work turned out to be one of the most challeng-\ning and arduous economic exercises I had ever undertaken. In Washington\nDC, I had the opportunity to meet some of world\u2019s most progressive econo-\nmists at the World Bank, Resources for the Future, World Resources Institute\nand the University of Maryland to discuss their views of the future of GPI-\nstyle accounting. Most were bullish that the GPI was an important measure-\nment effort that should be sustained, but that the model required more\nrigorous quantitative economic analysis to improve the full cost accounting\nestimates and care that the measure not become too value-biased. My most\nmemorable experience was sitting down with Dr. Herman Daly in his tiny\nUniversity of Maryland of\u0160ce. I consider Daly, one of the founding fathers of\nthe transdisciplinary \u0160eld of ecological economics, to be one of the greatest\nliving economists of our time and deserving of a Nobel Prize for economics. I\nasked Herman a question that would change the course of my economics\ncareer: \u201cIs it possible that our efforts at devising a money-denominated indica-\ntor of economic well-being (the GPI) might be futile since we are attempting\nto monetize quality-of-life issues which have value beyond monetary terms?\u201d\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 7\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 7\n\n\n\nDaly responded to my question with enthusiasm and encouraged me to pur-\nsue the answers with all of my life energy. His challenge has shaped my life in\nways I could not have imagined that afternoon sitting across from this hum-\nble, loving and courageous economist. To understand the importance of the\nnature of money and how it is created, Daly encouraged me to read Michael\nRowbotham\u2019s The Grip of Death (the title inspired by the French word mort-\ngage \u2014 meaning \u201ca pledge unto death\u201d) which was one of the most important\nbooks I read on my long journey to discover the nature of money.6 Daly ex-\nplained that over 90% of the world\u2019s money supply was actually created in the\nform of bank debts, not as paper currency created by governments. I then un-\nderstood that GPI-accounting paled in importance to more fundamental\nchanges required in the nature of money creation and banking. I later came to\nsee that the failure of the sustainability movement to understand and address\nthe nature of our debt-based money system would lead to a dead end street,\nsince genuine sustainability, based on principles of material suf\u0160ciency and\nsubsistence, is anathema to the high priests of our debt-money-economic-\ngrowth system.7\n\nIn January of 1999, my co-author Jonathan Rowe (an economic journal-\nist with Rede\u0160ning Progress) released the 1999 update to the US GPI result-\ning in almost no US media attention. The \u0160rst US GPI estimates by Cliff\nCobb, Jonathan Rowe and Ted Halstead in 1995 had won the attention of the\nAtlantic Monthly with a lead article and magazine cover proclaiming \u201cIf the\nGDP is Up, Why is America Down?\u201d8 Other media also inquired into the re-\nsults at that time. With the 1999 update, it seemed that Americans were\nmore intent on levitating stock market indices than on regrettable news of a\nsustained slide in the US GPI.\n\nBeginning the work in Canada\nIf updating the US GPI had been my economic Mt. Everest, my next goal was\ndeveloping a solid and permanent base camp to advance GPI accounting in\nCanada. I wanted to develop Rede\u0160ning Progress Canada and take the origi-\nnal US GPI work to a new level of sophistication and practical application.\nMy friend and former economics thesis advisor, Dr. Michael Percy now Dean\nof the Faculty of Business at the University of Alberta, gave me the chance to\ncreate and run a research think tank at the University of Alberta to explore al-\nternative accounting and measurement systems. What I had hoped to accom-\nplish in San Francisco I would try to do in Canada. I co-founded the Center for\n\n8 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 8\n\n\n\nPerformance Measurement and Management to conduct applied research on\nalternative measures of economic well-being and performance. For two years I\nserved as the center\u2019s Executive Director and co-taught a course in business\nand the environment with Dr. Ray Rasmussen. During my time with the cen-\nter, my vision for expanding the original GPI accounting system took shape.\nThis was the genesis of the Genuine Wealth system. In the winter of 1999 I\ndeveloped a conceptual grand research agenda for creating a transdisciplinary\nnetwork (well-being.net) of University of Alberta\u2019s top researchers to work on\nthe development of a genuine well-being indicators accounting system. My\nmission was to design a sustainability accounting system for Alberta to assess\nthe long-term sustainability of Alberta\u2019s human, social, natural, produced\n(built) and \u0160nancial capital assets. Unfortunately, it soon became apparent\nfrom discussions with senior members of the University of Alberta that creat-\ning a place for such interdisciplinary research would take years of complex\nnegotiation.\n\nFortunately my vision of advancing GPI-sustainable well-being account-\ning caught the attention of Rob Macintosh, the co-founder of the Pembina\nInstitute for Appropriate Development, one of Canada\u2019s premier environmen-\ntal think tanks. In the fall of 1999, Rob encouraged me to join the Pembina\nteam on a part-time basis. I accepted the opportunity and began splitting my\ntime between the University of Alberta and the Pembina Institute. Rob asked\nme to co-author one of many green budget proposals for the National Round\nTable on the Environment and Economy (NRTEE) which would be present-\ned to then Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin for his Budget 2000.\n\nI proposed that NRTEE create a research Center for Applied Sustainable\nEconomics. The proposed center, with a $10 million three-year budget, would\nhave two main goals: \n\n1. To apply improved or innovative methods for measuring the total wealth\nor well-being of Canadians that leads towards economic, ecological and\nsocial sustainability\n\n2. To revise existing \u0160scal policy instruments to help Canada move towards\na future where quality of life and competitive ef\u0160ciency are shared objec-\ntives in a world of ecological limits\n\nMy proposal also included revising national income accounts and the GDP to\nincorporate natural, human and social capital accounts to compliment exist-\ning economic/\u0160nancial accounts.\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 9\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:29 PM  Page 9\n\n\n\nThe \u0160nal version of the document proposed developing a set of environ-\nment and sustainable development indicators for Canada that would be re-\nported in parallel with other conventional economic indicators of progress.\nTo my surprise, the Chair of the NRTEE Dr. Stuart Smith fully embraced this\nproposal and brought it forward to Finance Minister Martin, who subse-\nquently announced a three-year, nine million dollar initiative in his spring\nBudget 2000. Martin\u2019s remarks as part of this budget presentation shocked\neven the most seasoned policy analysts when he stated:\n\nFinally, as we move to more fully integrate economic and environ-\nmental policy, we must come to grips with the fact that the current\nmeans of measuring progress are inadequate. Therefore, we are an-\nnouncing today that the National Round Table on the Environment\nand the Economy and Environment Canada, in collaboration with\nStatistics Canada, will be provided funding over the next three years\nto develop a set of indicators to measure environmental performance\nin conjunction with economic performance. In the years ahead, these\nenvironmental indicators could well have a greater impact on public policy\nthan any other single measure we might introduce [my emphasis].9\n\nI knew that a new era in economic reporting in Canada had begun. I spent the\nnext three years traveling to Ottawa as Sustainability Measurement Director\nof the Pembina Institute, developing Canada\u2019s \u0160rst set of environment and\nsustainable development indicators. Our work was completed and released in\nMay 2003. The \u0160nal results were somewhat disappointing: only \u0160ve natural\ncapital indicators (forest cover, freshwater quality, air quality, greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions, extent of wetlands) and one human capital indicator (edu-\ncational attainment) would augment familiar economic data, including the\ngross domestic product (GDP) and the consumer price index (CPI). However,\nthe most important outcome was the recommendation that Statistics Canada\nbegin to explore the options for expanding the System of National Accounts\n(from which the GDP is derived) to include more detailed information on\nnatural, human and social capital. If this recommendation was implemented,\nCanada would be the \u0160rst nation in the world to adopt a total capital account-\ning system that could measure the overall sustainability of the nation. Could\nmy recommendation to Paul Martin for a new balance sheet for the nation to\nmeasure the well-being or Genuine Wealth of Canada become a reality? I\n\n10 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 10\n\n\n\nbegan to feel that the possibility existed, given the good fortune my journey\nwas enjoying on a provincial level.\n\nWhile still working part-time at the University of Alberta in January\n2000, I had proposed to Jason Brisbois, senior economist of the federal gov-\nernment department of Western Economic Diversi\u0160cation (WED), and Brant\nPopp, senior policy analyst at WED, a research project to develop the \u0160rst\nprovincial-scale prototype GPI sustainability accounting and measurement\nsystem for the province of Alberta. Both Jason and Brant were enthused by\nthe idea and suggested I submit a formal proposal. At the same time Rob\nMacintosh encouraged me to do this work through the Pembina Institute. I\ndecided to leave the University of Alberta School of Business and form my\nown Pembina Institute sustainability measurement research team. My re-\nsearch project proposal to WED was accepted in April of 2000, and a team of\n\u0160ve researchers at the Pembina Institute began work on the Genuine Progress\nIndicators Pilot Project \u2014 Alberta Case Study: Accounting for Sustainable Develop-\nment. Our goal was to develop a sustainable well-being accounting and report-\ning system with Alberta as the case study. I began to assemble my Alberta\nGPI research team: Amy Taylor (resource economist), Mary Grif\u0160ths (PhD\nmedical geography and scientist), Sara Wilson (ecological economist), Jeff\nWilson (ecological footprint analyst), with guidance from Barbara Campbell\n(accountant). We began by developing a blue-print for the Alberta GPI\naccounts identifying three key domains: economic/\u0160nancial, social/human\nhealth and environmental. Between April of 2000 and March of 2001 our\nPembina team developed 51 economic, social, health and environmental\nwell-being indicators (GPIs) accounting for Alberta\u2019s progress over four\ndecades from 1961 to 1999. We combed hundreds of statistical databases\n(mostly from Statistics Canada) to construct our well-being ledgers. We\nwanted to answer key questions: Has the overall quality of life of Albertan\u2019s\nimproved over forty years? Are we on a sustainable course for our children?\nWe built on the original US GPI full-cost accounting framework, estimating\nthe full costs of environmental, social and human capital values and deprecia-\ntion costs. We also expanded the US GPI model to what I envisioned as a new\nsustainable well-being accounting system with well-being ledgers that\nwould account for the quantitative (statistical data) and qualitative (opinion\ndata) conditions of well-being. Our 51 indicators, which included the GDP,\nwere based on the Alberta Government\u2019s 24 performance indicators for peo-\nple, prosperity and preservation in Measuring Up, plus other indicators that\n\nMy Journey to Genuine Wealth 11\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 11\n\n\n\nwe felt would resonate with quality of life issues important to Albertans.\nThese indicators included time spent with family and friends, volunteer time,\nleisure time, income inequality, personal debt levels, divorce rates, disease\nand suicide rates, problem gambling rates and the ecological footprint (a ro-\nbust measure of the sustainability of our individual lifestyles). Our overall\ngoal was to complete a comprehensive well-being checkup of Alberta, as a\ndoctor would complete an annual health checkup. \n\nAfter many long nights of research, number crunching and analysis we\nreleased the Alberta GPI report on Monday morning, April 23, 2001. Titled\nAlberta Sustainability Trends 2000: The Genuine Progress Indicators Report 1961\nto 1999, our report hit a home run in terms of media coverage. It made the\nfront pages of Canada\u2019s national newspaper, the Globe and Mail, on April 23,\n2001 with the title \u201cFat Cat Albertans Struggle with Happiness\u201d and the\nfront page of the Edmonton Journal with the title \u201cAlberta\u2019s Natural Capital\nSlipping.\u201d I was stunned by the media attention. The phone rang off the hook\nthat day. I was interviewed for CBC television\u2019s nightly newscast The National\nbroadcast on both French and English television channels. Radio interviews\nincluded Alberta-broadcast CHED 630 radio and CBC radio in Montreal and\nWhitehorse. After an exhausting media-frenzied day, I knew that we had\ntapped into a deep current of public consciousness. The average Albertan un-\nderstood that real progress should be measured by more than an increment in\nthe GDP or stock market indices. We had put a quality-of-life-reality-mirror\nup to the GDP using a Genuine Progress Index that revealed that while\nAlberta\u2019s GDP had risen an average 4.4 percent per year over the period 1960\nto 1999, the more comprehensive Genuine Progress Index had declined at an\naverage rate of 0.5 percent during the same period. Indeed, throughout the\n1980s and 1990s the GPI was virtually stagnant as the GDP continued its as-\ncent. The economic credo that a rising tide of the GDP lifts all boats had been\nrepudiated again.\n\nOur results were not unlike the US GPI study. Although Alberta\u2019s Gen-\nuine Progress Index had remained relatively steady throughout the 1980s\nand 1990s, the US GPI had been in steady decline since the mid 1970s. The\nGPI well-being diagnosis also revealed that the average real (de\u0161ated for in-\n\u0161ation) disposable incomes of average Albertans had stagnated since 1981\neven as the GDP continued to rise through to 1999. Most Albertans could re-\nlate to this reality. Other regrettable economic and social trends included ris-\ning rates of suicide, divorce, problem gambling and personal debt. Many of\n\n12 The Economics of Happiness\n\nEconoHappinessPress.qxp  4/19/2007  12:30 PM  Page 12\n\n\n\nthe environmental indicators also showed negative trends including declin-\ning oil and gas reserves, massive fragmentation of forest ecosystem and rising\nlevels of toxic waste production.\n\nOur report sustained media and public attention for several weeks. I was\ninvited to speak at numerous conferences about our \u0160ndings. We had provid-\ned the basis of an important dialogue in Alberta addressing economist Stanley\nK\u00fcznets\u2019 challenge: more growth of what and for whom? Interesting, but not\nsurprising, was the lack of any formal response from the Alberta Government\nand most notably from Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. Klein\u2019s response was\nsimply that we were entitled to our own view of progress \u2014 a compliment\ngiven his penchant for polemic outbursts. The relative silence from the\nAlberta Government suggested that our longitudinal well-being check-up of\nAlberta\u2019s economic, social and environmental progress was relatively fair and\naccurate. Our report had its critics, primarily economists who argued that the\ncreation of a composite well-being index was fraught with methodological\nproblems, including indicator selection biases and giving all indicators equal\nweight.

Here&#x27;s how:\n\n1. **Chapter 1: My Journey to Genuine Wealth** - Anielski shares his personal and professional journey towards understanding and measuring wealth beyond traditional economic metrics. He explores the inception of the Genuine Wealth Model, indicating his early recognition of the limitations of conventional economic indicators like GDP. This supports his view of shifting towards more holistic measures that may better predict and influence a sustainable future.\n\n2. **Chapter 3: What\u2019s Wrong with the Picture of Progress** - This chapter critiques the adequacy of GDP as a measure of societal progress and discusses the development of alternative measures like the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). This supports Anielski&#x27;s perspective that traditional measures are insufficient for capturing true societal well-being and suggests a need for metrics that better reflect social and environmental health.\n\n3. **Chapter 4: A Renaissance in Economics and Capitalism** - Anielski argues for a significant transformation in the way economies operate and are measured, drawing on historical and philosophical bases for a systemic change. This reflects his view on the necessity of redefining economic success to align more closely with ecological sustainability and human well-being.\n\n4. **Chapter 5: The Genuine Wealth Model** - This chapter outlines the Genuine Wealth Model in detail, a comprehensive approach for measuring the well-being of communities through various forms of capital including natural, social, and human capital. This model embodies Anielski&#x27;s idealistic vision of integrating more meaningful metrics into economic evaluations and policy-making.\n\n5. **Chapter 7: The Genuine Wealth of Communities and Nations** - The practical application of the Genuine Wealth Model in various communities and its impact on improving policies and community well-being are explored here. This demonstrates Anielski&#x27;s claim that these measures can influence better futures, though, as you noted, the broader global adoption and effectiveness of such measures might seem overly optimistic given current global challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, while Anielski&#x27;s assertions are supported by the chapters, the practical impact and widespread adoption of these holistic measures in influencing policy on a global scale might indeed appear idealistic, especially considering the increasing environmental and social challenges faced worldwide. The question of whether governments should prioritize more concrete solutions over idealistic ones is valid and underscores a global debate on the efficacy of such innovative yet untraditional approaches."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Create a set of up to 10 metrics \u2013 including economic, environmental, and social indicators \u2013 that you believe should be incorporated into the national sustainability planning for that country. Research the country\u2019s performance against these metrics and create a \u2018country profile\u2019 briefly explaining why you chose these indicators, how your country performed, and innovative ideas you might have for increasing their sustainability across social, economic, and environmental measures.\nOkay, I will say it over and over again. I will say it until it ends or there is no more breath in my body: Capitalism is a cancer to humanity, and until we heal the cancer, we are merely trying to bail out a sinking ship with a teaspoon and an idealistic plan. To envision a future where resources are sustainably maintained, I keep returning to the same thought. As long as profit remains the bottom line for countries and all activities are measured solely by their economic effects, we sabotage our success before we even begin. We sabotage society by not prioritizing our primary objective, which should be societal well-being and happiness. Unfortunately, profit is the primary objective in a capitalist society, not societal well-being. Therefore, the ten metrics I would propose for Italy&#x27;s sustainability planning: \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: This is a measure of economic activity within a country. It\u2019s not a measure of wealth or productivity but is often used as such.\nGini Coefficient: This is a measure of inequality in a society. A lower Gini Coefficient indicates a more equal distribution of wealth.\nEnvironmental Performance Index (EPI): measures a nation\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions: This is a measure of a country\u2019s impact on climate change.\nRenewable Energy Consumption: The nation\u2019s percentage of total energy consumption that comes from renewable sources.\nEducation Index: This is a component of the Human Development Index (HDI) and measures years of schooling for adults and expected years of schooling for children.\nLife Expectancy at Birth: This is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, assuming that current mortality rates remain constant throughout their lifetime.\nCultural Diversity Index: This measures a country&#x27;s cultural diversity, including languages, ethnicities, and religions.\nHappiness Index: This measures subjective well-being and asks people to rate their overall satisfaction with life.\nSocial Support Index: This measures the level of social support an average individual has, which is crucial for mental health and well-being.\nHowever, these metrics do not truly indicate where Italy or any country is at because they are based on the platform of capitalism. The financial metrics heavily influences the social and environmental indicators and all non-financial metrics. Ultimately, a country&#x27;s ability to sustainably manage resources depends on its economic resources and regulation of commerce.\nUpon reviewing the data presented by the Happiness Index, Italy ranks 18th globally. However, regarding metrics concerning sustainable practices and pollution, Italy finds itself in the red. While the economic situation in Italy is less favorable than one would hope, wage inequality runs rampant. Simultaneously, as in many other nations worldwide, inflation abounds, particularly in the housing market. One may wonder how the 18th most happy country out of over 120 nations (Happy Planet Index \u2013 Good Lives Don\u2019t Have to Cost the Earth, n.d.) can experience such issues. Would it be premature to assign blame to capitalism?\n\n\nBefore Italy became the republic it is today, a place I live, know, and love, there were the evil fascists who committed atrocities such as giving land to people, constructing entire blocks and neighborhoods, and creating a sense of nationalism and unity under one Italian flag. Finally, they empowered a man whom my Italian-born and bred fiance described as &quot;inferiority complex...pavido... apathetic, rapist.&quot; Of course, he referred to the austere and shining figure of Italian fascism, il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Back then, they had a different system, perhaps less democratic, but seemingly more for the people with arguably better, more sustainable industrial, commercial, and lifestyle practices. However, that is a paradox for another discussion post. \n\n\nToday, in Italy&#x27;s economic climate, there is some uncertainty amongst the populace regarding the feasibility and sustainability of Capitalism, both locally and internationally. The causes and effects of these uncertainties affect their overall well-being. Thus, the first measure of my criteria is the people&#x27;s ability to earn a living, essentially their economic ability to achieve their most important ends - clean water, food, housing, and healthcare. These necessities are the most crucial gross domestic products to consider. Hence, Italy&#x27;s GDP and Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality within a nation (The World Bank, 2024), should factor into its national sustainability plan. Italy has fared well so far, but like many other places, it could do better.\n\n\nItaly\u2019s GDP per capita stands at approximately $34,776.40, reflecting a robust economic framework, yet this figure only skims the surface of the nation\u2019s broader socio-economic reality (The World Bank, 2024). The Gini Coefficient 34.8 signals significant income disparity, an issue that economic indicators alone cannot resolve (The World Bank, 2024). \nItaly\u2019s moderate Environmental Performance Index (EPI) score of 57.70 suggests a commitment to environmental sustainability, but there is substantial room for improvement, especially in enhancing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions further and bolster renewable energy initiatives (Yale University., 2024). The nation\u2019s push towards renewable energy is commendable, with 32.4% of its electricity demand met by renewables as of 2022 (International Trade Administration, 2023). Such efforts are crucial in transitioning to a sustainable energy future. Moreover, Italy\u2019s high life expectancy of 82.8 years (Happy Planet Index \u2013 Good Lives Don\u2019t Have to Cost the Earth, n.d.) and a moderate Happiness Index score of 6.26 (Italy | Environmental Performance Index, n.d.) reflect a society that enjoys a good quality of life. Yet, these figures mask the underlying challenges of social inequality and environmental concerns (Rowan, 2023).\nGiven these data points, Italy\u2019s sustainability planning should pivot from a purely capitalist focus to a more holistic approach that balances economic performance with social equity and environmental stewardship. The drive towards a sustainable future in Italy could be likened to the intricate art of making the perfect tiramisu\u2014meticulously balancing the bitter with the sweet to achieve harmony. Achieving a balance between economic growth, social equity, and environmental conservation is crucial to securing a better future for Italy. Although a complete overhaul of the current capitalist system is unlikely, it is vital that the country strives to create a more cooperative and equitable global community. By prioritizing societal well-being, Italy can foster sustainable practices that promote the health and prosperity of both its citizens and the planet.\n\n\nPart 2: \nShould international governmental organizations, such as the United Nations, the IMF, and World Bank, adopt new economic metrics that incorporate social well-being and environmental resource utilization into their economic modeling?\n\nYes, the organizations referenced above should adopt new metrics that measure more than the economic value of an action or activity. The economic value of an action does not always reflect its contribution to society&#x27;s overall well-being (Sturgeon, 2019). \nTo what degree have they adopted these types of metrics already?\n Some organizations and nations have begun to adopt more holistic metrics; however, the degree to which these metrics have been implemented varies from aspirational to newly implemented (Enhancing IMF-World Bank Collaboration, n.d.; Incorporating Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Factors Into Fixed Income Investments, n.d.).  \nWhat is the argument for and/or against this type of shift in performance measurement? \nThe argument is straightforward: economic indicators fail to capture the full societal benefits. Therefore, we need additional metrics that can measure and indicate the overall benefits, including those relevant to national and global sustainable planning (Sturgeon, 2019).  \nHow could this spur a more holistic and transparent view of economies, social progress, and environmental sustainability?\nBy prioritizing what truly matters and allocating our attention accordingly, we can expect to see a decline in misguided policies and economic systems that lack insight and compassion. When we accurately gauge what needs to be measured, we can more readily identify aspects that detract from the well-being of society as a whole.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8825f3761b00ba8b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "5f450452-b6ba-4f11-ad1b-ad3307e02232", "children": ["08b6a35a-879b-483a-87bb-df54c7d47478"]}, "08b6a35a-879b-483a-87bb-df54c7d47478": {"id": "08b6a35a-879b-483a-87bb-df54c7d47478", "message": {"id": "08b6a35a-879b-483a-87bb-df54c7d47478", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715470170.19035, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Based on the provided rubric, let&#x27;s assess the person&#x27;s response:\n\n1. **Content (15/15 points):** The response addresses the discussion question prompt by proposing a set of metrics for Italy&#x27;s sustainability planning and discussing the current economic climate and potential improvements.

Ultimately, a country&#x27;s ability to sustainably manage resources depends on its financial resources and regulation of commerce.\nUpon reviewing the data presented by the Happiness Index, Italy ranks 18th globally. However, in terms of metrics concerning sustainable practices and pollution, Italy finds itself in the red. While the economic situation in Italy is not as positive as one would hope, wage inequality runs rampant. Simultaneously, as in many other nations currently around the world, inflation, particularly in the housing market, abounds. One may wonder how the 18th most happy country, out of over 120 nations, can experience such issues. Is it premature to assign the blame to Capitalism?\n\n\nBefore Italy became the republic it is today, a place I know and love, there were the evil fascists who committed atrocities such as giving land to people, constructing entire blocks and neighborhoods, and creating a sense of nationalism and unity under one Italian flag. Finally, they empowered a man, whom my Italian-born and bred fiance described as &quot;inferiority complex...pavido..., apathetic, rapist.&quot; Of course, he referred to the austere and shining figure of Italian fascism, il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Back then, they had a different system, perhaps less democratic, but seemingly more for the people with arguably better, more sustainable industrial, commercial, and lifestyle practices. However, that is a paradox for another discussion post. \n\n\nToday, in Italy&#x27;s economic climate, there is some uncertainty amongst the populace regarding the feasibility and sustainability of Capitalism, both locally and internationally. The causes and effects of these uncertainties affect their overall well-being. Thus, the first measure of my criteria is the people&#x27;s ability to earn a living, essentially their economic ability to achieve their most important ends - clean water, food, housing, and healthcare. These necessities are the most crucial gross domestic products to consider. Hence, Italy&#x27;s GDP, as well as its Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality within a nation, should factor into its national sustainability plan. Italy seems to have fared well so far, but like many other places, it could do better.\nInsert data-rich descriptive and supporting paragraph  based around this info cited in apa 7 format with apa reference list at end: \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: As of 2022, Italy\u2019s GDP per capita was approximately $33,28112.\nGini Coefficient: The Gini Coefficient for Italy, which measures income inequality, was around 34.8 in 20213.\nEnvironmental Performance Index (EPI): Italy\u2019s EPI score was approximately 57.7456, indicating a moderate commitment to environmental sustainability.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions: Italy has made efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions7891011.

Research the country\u2019s performance against these metrics and create a \u2018country profile\u2019 briefly explaining why you chose these indicators, how your country performed, and innovative ideas you might have for increasing their sustainability across social, economic, and environmental measures.\nComplete the passage below to answer the question above and follow the insert prompts . \n\nOkay, I\u2019ll say it over and over again. I\u2019ll say it until it ends or there is no more breath in my body: Capitalism is a cancer to humanity and until we kill the cancer we are merely trying to bail out a sinking ship with a teaspoon and an idealistic plan. To envision a future where resources are sustainably maintained, I keep coming back to the same thought: as long as profit remains the bottom line for countries, and all activities are measured solely by their economic effects, we sabotage our success before we even begin. This is because we do not prioritize our primary objective, which should be societal well-being and happiness. Unfortunately, in a capitalist society, profit is the primary objective, not societal well-being. Therefore, the 10 metrics I would propose for Italy&#x27;s sustainability planning: \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: This is a measure of economic activity within a country. It\u2019s not a measure of wealth or productivity but is often used as such.\nGini Coefficient: This is a measure of inequality in a society. A lower Gini Coefficient indicates a more equal distribution of wealth.\nEnvironmental Performance Index (EPI): This index measures a nation\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions: This is a measure of a country\u2019s impact on climate change.\nRenewable Energy Consumption: The percentage of total energy consumption that comes from renewable sources.\nEducation Index: This is a component of the Human Development Index (HDI) and is a measure of years of schooling for adults and expected years of schooling for children.\nLife Expectancy at Birth: This is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, assuming that current mortality rates remain constant throughout their lifetime.\nCultural Diversity Index: This measures the cultural diversity in a country, including languages, ethnicities, and religions.\nHappiness Index: This measures subjective well-being and asks people to rate their overall satisfaction with life.\nSocial Support Index: This measures the level of social support an average individual has, which is crucial for mental health and well-being.\ndo not truly indicate where Italy or any country is at, because they are based on the platform of capitalism. The social and environmental indicators, as well as all non-financial metrics, are heavily influenced by the financial metrics. Ultimately, a country&#x27;s ability to sustainably manage resources depends on its financial resources and regulation of commerce.\nUpon reviewing the data presented by the Happiness Index, Italy ranks 18th globally. However, in terms of metrics concerning sustainable practices and pollution, Italy finds itself in the red. While the economic situation in Italy is not as positive as one would hope, wage inequality runs rampant. Simultaneously, as in many other nations currently around the world, inflation, particularly in the housing market, abounds. One may wonder how the 18th most happy country, out of over 120 nations, can experience such issues. Is it premature to assign the blame to Capitalism?\n\n\nBefore Italy became the republic it is today, a place I know and love, there were the evil fascists who committed atrocities such as giving land to people, constructing entire blocks and neighborhoods, and creating a sense of nationalism and unity under one Italian flag. Finally, they empowered a man, whom my Italian-born and bred fiance described as &quot;inferiority complex...pavido..., apathetic, rapist.&quot; Of course, he referred to the austere and shining figure of Italian fascism, il Duce: Benito Mussolini. Back then, they had a different system, perhaps less democratic, but seemingly more for the people with arguably better, more sustainable industrial, commercial, and lifestyle practices. However, that is a paradox for another discussion post. \n\n\nToday, in Italy&#x27;s economic climate, there is some uncertainty amongst the populace regarding the feasibility and sustainability of Capitalism, both locally and internationally. The causes and effects of these uncertainties affect their overall well-being. Thus, the first measure of my criteria is the people&#x27;s ability to earn a living, essentially their economic ability to achieve their most important ends - clean water, food, housing, and healthcare. These necessities are the most crucial gross domestic products to consider. Hence, Italy&#x27;s GDP, as well as its Gini Coefficient, which measures income inequality within a nation, should factor into its national sustainability plan. Italy seems to have fared well so far, but like many other places, it could do better.\nInsert data-rich descriptive and supporting paragraph  based around this info cited in apa 7 format with apa reference list at end: \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: As of 2022, Italy\u2019s GDP per capita was approximately $33,28112.\nGini Coefficient: The Gini Coefficient for Italy, which measures income inequality, was around 34.8 in 20213.\nEnvironmental Performance Index (EPI): Italy\u2019s EPI score was approximately 57.7456, indicating a moderate commitment to environmental sustainability.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions: Italy has made efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions7891011. However, it\u2019s important to note that the success of these efforts can vary year by year and depend on numerous factors.\nRenewable Energy Consumption: Italy has made significant strides in increasing its renewable energy consumption12131415. As of 2022, renewables satisfied approximately 32.4% of Italy\u2019s electricity demand14.\nEducation Index: While specific data for an \u201cEducation Index\u201d is not readily available, Italy has a high level of education, with various reports noting the country\u2019s commitment to education1617181920.\nLife Expectancy at Birth: Life expectancy at birth in Italy is around 82.8 years21222324, which is higher than the global average.\nCultural Diversity Index: While a specific \u201cCultural Diversity Index\u201d is not readily available, Italy is known for its rich cultural diversity25262728.\nHappiness Index: Italy\u2019s happiness index score was approximately 6.47 in 2021293031, indicating a moderate level of reported happiness among its citizens.\nSocial Support Index: Specific data for a \u201cSocial Support Index\u201d is not readily available. However, various reports note Italy\u2019s commitment to social welfare3233343536.\n\n\n\n\nInsert witty conclusion here \n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8817a55c1d100f5a-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "8f0f6074-3c29-45b9-a025-40deb4e2577c", "children": ["bdde6be4-fac5-4f3f-852c-4196d67e2a8a"]}, "bdde6be4-fac5-4f3f-852c-4196d67e2a8a": {"id": "bdde6be4-fac5-4f3f-852c-4196d67e2a8a", "message": {"id": "bdde6be4-fac5-4f3f-852c-4196d67e2a8a", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1715320209.785998, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["In Italy, a country celebrated for its deep cultural roots and remarkable historical significance, the economic narrative often dominates discussions of sustainability and national well-being. While it&#x27;s clear that financial health is imperative for sustaining basic societal functions, the focus on capitalism alone overshadows equally critical social and environmental concerns.\n\nItaly&#x27;s GDP per capita stands at approximately $33,281, reflecting a robust economic framework, yet this figure only skims the surface of the nation&#x27;s broader socio-economic reality. The Gini Coefficient, at 34.8, signals significant income disparity, an issue that economic indicators alone cannot resolve. Italy\u2019s moderate Environmental Performance Index (EPI) score of 57.7456 suggests a commitment to environmental sustainability, but there&#x27;s substantial room for improvement, especially in enhancing policies to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and bolster renewable energy initiatives.\n\nThe nation&#x27;s push towards renewable energy is commendable, with 32.4% of its electricity demand met by renewables as of 2022. Such efforts are crucial in transitioning to a sustainable energy future. Moreover, Italy\u2019s high life expectancy of 82.8 years and a moderate Happiness Index score of 6.47 reflect a society that enjoys a good quality of life, yet these figures mask the underlying challenges of social inequality and environmental concerns.\n\nGiven these data points, Italy\u2019s sustainability planning should pivot from a purely capitalist focus to a more holistic approach that balances economic performance with social equity and environmental stewardship. The drive towards a sustainable future in Italy could be likened to the intricate art of making a perfect espresso\u2014meticulously balancing the bitter with the sweet to achieve harmony. As Italy moves forward, it must blend economic robustness with social justice and environmental care, ensuring that its sustainability is as enduring as its cultural legacy.\n\n**References:**\n1.

Here are some benefits of insects for dogs:\n\n1. **High Protein Content**: Many insects are high in protein, which is essential for a dog&#x27;s muscle development and overall health.\n2. **Rich in Nutrients**: Insects can also be rich in other nutrients such as fats, vitamins, and minerals. For example, they can contain high levels of B vitamins, iron, magnesium, selenium, and fatty acids.\n3. **Hypoallergenic**: Insect protein can be a good alternative for dogs that are allergic to more common protein sources like chicken or beef.\n4. **Sustainable**: Insects are a more environmentally friendly source of protein since they require less land, water, and food than traditional livestock.\n\nCommon insects used in dog food include crickets, black soldier fly larvae, and mealworms. These insects are usually processed into a meal or powder and added to kibble or wet food formulations.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to ensure that any insects fed to dogs are sourced from safe, reputable suppliers that prepare them specifically for pet consumption. This is to avoid potential contaminants or pesticides that might be present in insects not intended for pet food use.

Many companies that produce insect-based dog food are keen on promoting these aspects.\n\n6. **Reviews and Recommendations**: Look for reviews from other pet owners who have tried this food.

White privilege refers to the societal advantages that white people experience simply by virtue of being white, often at the expense of people of color. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Representation in Media**: White people are more likely to see people who look like them represented positively and frequently in mainstream media, including movies, television shows, and advertisements. People of color are often underrepresented or portrayed in stereotypical and limited roles.\n\n2. **Access to Education**: White students are more likely to attend well-funded schools with experienced teachers and a wide range of academic opportunities. People of color, especially those from low-income communities, often attend underfunded schools with fewer resources and higher rates of discipline.\n\n3. **Employment Opportunities**: White job applicants are more likely to be hired and promoted compared to equally qualified applicants of color. This is due to biases in hiring processes, as well as networks and connections that often exclude people of color.\n\n4. **Criminal Justice System**: White people are less likely to be stopped, arrested, or sentenced harshly compared to people of color for the same offenses. This disparity is evident in various stages of the criminal justice system, including policing, prosecution, and sentencing.\n\n5. **Access to Healthcare**: White people generally have better access to quality healthcare services, including health insurance coverage and medical facilities. People of color often face barriers such as discrimination, lack of culturally competent care, and limited access to healthcare facilities in their communities.\n\n6. **Housing Discrimination**: White people are more likely to secure housing in desirable neighborhoods with higher property values and better amenities. People of color often face discrimination in housing markets, including redlining and racial steering, which limit their housing options and perpetuate segregation.\n\n7. **Social and Cultural Norms**: White cultural norms and values are often considered the default in society, while the experiences and perspectives of people of color are marginalized or ignored. This can manifest in various ways, from language and dress codes to beauty standards and social interactions.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how white privilege operates in society. It&#x27;s important to recognize that white privilege doesn&#x27;t mean that individual white people haven&#x27;t faced hardships or struggles in their lives, but rather that systemic advantages exist for them based on their race."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, there are still instances where certain groups, often those perceived as &quot;white&quot; or of European descent, may have advantages in accessing education compared to others.\n\nHere are some examples of disparities in access to education in Italy:\n\n1. **Migrant Children and Education**: Children of migrants, particularly those from non-European countries, often face barriers in accessing education in Italy. According to a report by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) in 2019, migrant children are more likely to drop out of school compared to Italian children. This can be due to factors such as language barriers, discrimination, and lack of support systems.\n\n2. **Segregation in Schools**: There have been instances of segregation and discrimination in Italian schools, particularly against Roma and Sinti children. A report by Amnesty International in 2018 highlighted how Roma and Sinti children are often placed in separate classes or schools, limiting their access to quality education and perpetuating social exclusion.\n\n3. **Language Barriers**: Children from immigrant families, especially those whose first language is not Italian, may face challenges in the education system due to language barriers. While there are support programs such as Italian language courses for immigrant children, these may not always be sufficient to address the linguistic and cultural needs of all students.\n\n4. **Access to Higher Education**: Despite legal provisions for equal access to higher education, students from marginalized backgrounds may still face obstacles in pursuing higher education in Italy. This can include financial barriers, lack of information about available opportunities, and discrimination in admissions processes.\n\n5. **Racial Discrimination**: Discrimination based on race or ethnicity can affect students&#x27; experiences in Italian schools, including interactions with teachers and peers, disciplinary practices, and opportunities for academic and extracurricular activities. While there is limited research specifically on racial discrimination in Italian schools, anecdotal evidence and reports from advocacy groups suggest that it remains a concern.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to note that while Italy does not have the same history of racial segregation and discrimination as countries like the United States, issues of inequality and discrimination still exist and can impact access to education for marginalized groups, including immigrants and ethnic minorities.\n\nSources:\n1.

Additionally, some schools may request voluntary contributions from parents to support specific initiatives or projects.\n\nIn addition to public schools, Italy also has private schools, which may charge tuition fees. These schools operate alongside the public system and often offer alternative educational approaches or specialized programs. However, they must also follow certain regulations set by the government.\n\nOverall, the Italian government prioritizes providing access to education for all children and young people, regardless of their socio-economic background, through its public education system."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It&#x27;s clear that he values seeing people as individuals and wants to promote equality. Recognizing his intentions can help set a positive tone for the conversation.\n\n2. **Share Your Personal Experience**: Explain to your partner how your experiences as a Black person from America have shaped your understanding of privilege and identity. Share specific examples of how your race has influenced the way you are perceived and treated in various situations, including in education, employment, and social interactions.\n\n3. **Discuss Systemic Inequality**: Help your partner understand that while it&#x27;s admirable to see everyone as equals, systemic inequalities based on race still exist. These inequalities can affect access to opportunities, resources, and treatment in society. Share statistics and research to illustrate the disparities that persist, even if they may not be immediately apparent to him.\n\n4. **Highlight Your Partner&#x27;s Privileges**: Encourage your partner to reflect on his own privileges, such as being white and not having to navigate certain challenges that come with being a person of color. Help him understand that acknowledging these privileges doesn&#x27;t diminish his worth as an individual but can instead foster empathy and awareness of others&#x27; experiences.\n\n5. **Explain the Importance of Cultural Identity**: Share with your partner why cultural identity is meaningful to you and why it&#x27;s not something you can simply choose to ignore. Explain how cultural identity shapes one&#x27;s sense of self, community, and belonging, and how it can influence various aspects of life, including language, traditions, and perspectives.\n\n6. **Encourage Open Dialogue**: Emphasize the importance of having open and honest conversations about these topics, even if they may be uncomfortable at times. Encourage your partner to ask questions and express any concerns or uncertainties he may have, and be prepared to listen and respond empathetically.\n\nBy approaching the conversation with empathy, understanding, and a willingness to engage with each other&#x27;s perspectives, you and your partner can deepen your understanding of privilege, identity, and the complexities of navigating these issues in society."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are some strategies you might consider when discussing privilege and identity with your partner:\n\n1. **Start with Shared Values**: Begin the conversation by emphasizing shared values, such as a commitment to fairness, equality, and empathy. By framing the discussion in terms of values you both hold dear, you may create a more receptive environment for exploring difficult topics.\n\n2. **Use Personal Stories**: Sometimes, personal anecdotes and stories can be more impactful than statistics or reports. Share your own experiences with your partner and encourage them to do the same. Personal stories can help humanize the issues and foster empathy and understanding.\n\n3. **Appeal to Empathy**: Help your partner understand the importance of empathy in understanding the experiences of others. Encourage them to imagine themselves in someone else&#x27;s shoes and consider how they might feel or react in similar situations. Emphasize that empathy is not about agreeing with or condoning others&#x27; experiences but about recognizing and validating their feelings and perspectives.\n\n4. **Provide Relatable Examples**: Offer examples of privilege and discrimination that your partner can relate to in their own life. This could include instances where they may have benefited from privilege or instances where they have witnessed discrimination firsthand. Relatable examples can make abstract concepts more tangible and easier to understand.\n\n5. **Encourage Critical Thinking**: Encourage your partner to approach new information with an open mind and a willingness to critically evaluate their own beliefs and assumptions. Remind them that learning and growth often require questioning and challenging our existing knowledge and perspectives.\n\n6. **Seek Professional Help**: If you find that discussions with your partner consistently reach an impasse or become emotionally charged, consider seeking the guidance of a professional counselor or therapist. A neutral third party can provide support and facilitate constructive dialogue in a safe and respectful environment.\n\nUltimately, fostering open communication, empathy, and a willingness to engage with uncomfortable topics can help bridge the gap between differing perspectives and promote understanding and growth within your relationship."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

While there isn&#x27;t a single, universally agreed-upon set of principles of fascism, there are common themes and characteristics typically associated with fascist movements. Here are some of them:\n\n1. **Authoritarianism**: Fascism advocates for a strong, centralized government led by a single leader or dictator. This leader often has almost absolute power and authority over the state.\n\n2. **Nationalism**: Fascism emphasizes the importance of the nation or ethnic group above all else. It promotes a sense of national unity, pride, and superiority, often at the expense of other nations or groups deemed inferior.\n\n3. **Totalitarianism**: Fascist regimes seek to control all aspects of society, including politics, the economy, culture, and even private life. They often employ censorship, propaganda, and repression to maintain control and suppress dissent.\n\n4. **Militarism**: Fascism glorifies war and military strength as essential components of national greatness. It often seeks to expand territory through conquest and views military aggression as a legitimate means to achieve national goals.\n\n5. **Anti-democracy**: Fascism rejects liberal democracy and views it as weak, decadent, and inefficient. Instead, it advocates for a form of &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;integral&quot; democracy, in which the nation is represented by a single party or leader who embodies the will of the people.\n\n6. **Social hierarchy**: Fascism promotes the idea of a hierarchical society, with certain groups (usually defined by race, ethnicity, or nationality) considered superior to others. It often discriminates against minority groups and seeks to maintain the dominance of the ruling class.\n\n7. **Corporate statism**: Fascism advocates for close collaboration between the state and large corporations, with the state playing a dominant role in directing economic activity. This form of corporatism is intended to promote national unity and economic development.\n\n8. **Cult of personality**: Fascist leaders are often elevated to near-divine status and portrayed as charismatic saviors or strongmen who can rescue the nation from crisis and lead it to greatness.\n\n9. **Scapegoating and propaganda**: Fascist regimes often scapegoat minority groups, political opponents, or external enemies for societal problems or national decline. Propaganda is used to manipulate public opinion and rally support for the regime&#x27;s policies.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to note that while these principles capture common features of fascism, the ideology can manifest differently in different contexts and historical periods. Additionally, not all fascist movements adhere strictly to all of these principles, and there is ongoing debate among scholars about the precise definition and characteristics of fascism."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Soak the salted baccal\u00e0 in cold water for at least 72 hours, changing the water 2-3 times to remove excess salt. Once soaked, pat the baccal\u00e0 dry with paper towels.\n2. Cut the baccal\u00e0 into serving-sized pieces.\n3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\n4. Dredge the baccal\u00e0 pieces in flour, shaking off any excess.\n5. Carefully place the baccal\u00e0 pieces in the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side.\n6. Once fried, remove the baccal\u00e0 from the skillet and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.\n7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n8.

Here&#x27;s a brief rundown of the activities noted in the logs:\n\n1. **Initialization and Status Updates**: The Trusted Installer initializes and starts the main loop. Various locks are added during this process to ensure that operations are safely managed without conflicts.\n\n2. **Handling of Windows Update Tasks**: The log entries show interactions with Windows Update Agent, where packages are being processed and updates are identified.\n\n3. **Lock Mechanism**: Several entries mention &quot;locks,&quot; such as &quot;New lock added&quot;. In computing and specifically in this context, a &quot;lock&quot; is a mechanism that prevents multiple processes from accessing the same resource, such as a file or a network device, at the same time. This is crucial for preventing data corruption and ensuring that only one process can make changes at a time.\n\n   - **Example**: `Lock: New lock added: CCbsPublicSessionClassFactory, level: 30, total lock:4`. This suggests that a new lock was created to handle sessions securely, ensuring that no other processes interfere while the current process is using a specific resource.\n\nLocks in the context of a CBS log typically relate to managing access to system components during updates or modifications, ensuring that no two processes attempt to modify the system simultaneously, which could lead to errors or system instability.\n\nLet me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific entries or need further explanation about the processes mentioned in the log!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

For concerns about potential viruses or malware, you would need to check the logs from an antivirus program or the Windows Security event logs, which are specifically designed to report on security issues, including malware detection and system security events.\n\nIf you&#x27;re worried about a potential virus or malware on your computer, here are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. **Run a Full Antivirus Scan**: Use your installed antivirus software to conduct a comprehensive scan of your system. Ensure your antivirus definitions are up to date.\n\n2. **Check for Updates**: Make sure your operating system and software are up-to-date, as updates often include security patches.\n\n3. **Review System Behavior**: Look for unusual behavior such as slow system performance, unexpected ads, frequent crashes, or unfamiliar applications starting automatically.\n\n4. **Examine Security Logs**: Review the Windows Security logs for any alerts or warnings that might indicate unauthorized access or malicious activities.\n\nIf you have specific security logs or notice unusual behavior you&#x27;d like to investigate, feel free to share more details or logs, and I can help you analyze them!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here are some common causes and steps you can take to diagnose and possibly resolve the issue:\n\n### 1. High Resource Usage\nSince your system is using about 59% of your RAM at baseline, it&#x27;s possible that certain processes or applications are consuming substantial system resources, causing slowdowns. Here\u2019s how to investigate:\n\n- **Task Manager**: Open the Task Manager (you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` or right-clicking the taskbar and selecting &quot;Task Manager&quot;). Look at the Processes tab to see if there are any applications or background processes consuming a high amount of CPU, memory, or disk resources. Consider closing or uninstalling unnecessary or resource-heavy applications.\n\n### 2. Background Processes\nWindows often runs background processes such as updates, indexing, and system checks, which can momentarily increase resource usage:\n\n- **Windows Update**: Check if Windows Update is running in the background. Sometimes, Windows Update can cause system slowdowns when downloading or installing updates.\n- **System Maintenance**: Automatic maintenance tasks (like disk defragmentation and system diagnostics) might be running. You can check and adjust the settings in the Control Panel under Security and Maintenance.\n\n### 3. Malware Scan\nAs previously mentioned, unexpected system behavior could be due to malware:\n\n- **Antivirus Scan**: Perform a full system scan using your antivirus software to rule out the possibility of malware affecting your system\u2019s performance.\n\n### 4. Startup Programs\nToo many programs starting up when you turn on your computer can slow it down significantly:\n\n- **Manage Startup Programs**: Use the Task Manager\u2019s Startup tab to disable unnecessary startup programs, which can help improve the system\u2019s boot time and overall performance.\n\n### 5. System Drivers and Software Updates\nOutdated drivers or software can also cause performance issues:\n\n- **Update Drivers and Software**: Ensure that all your system drivers (especially graphics and chipset drivers) and installed software are up to date.\n\n### 6. Operating System Integrity\nSometimes, system files can become corrupted, affecting performance:\n\n- **System File Checker (SFC)**: Run the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files. You can do this by opening Command Prompt as an administrator and running the command `sfc /scannow`.\n\n### 7. Hardware Issues\nHardware problems, such as a failing hard drive or inadequate RAM for your current usage, can also cause symptoms like these:\n\n- **Check Disk for Errors**: Run a disk check by opening Command Prompt as an administrator and typing `chkdsk /f /r`.\n- **Memory Upgrade**: If your tasks are memory-intensive and you frequently run out of RAM, consider upgrading your RAM.\n\nTry these steps to see if they help reduce the frequency of the spinning wheel. If the problem persists, there might be more specific issues at play, and further investigation might be necessary."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Schedule `chkdsk` to Run at Boot\nSince `chkdsk` needs exclusive access to the volume to perform repairs, it&#x27;s often necessary to schedule it to run the next time your system boots up. Here&#x27;s how you can do that:\n\n- Open Command Prompt as an administrator. You can do this by searching for &quot;cmd&quot; in the Start menu, right-clicking on &quot;Command Prompt&quot;, and choosing &quot;Run as administrator&quot;.\n- Enter the command: `chkdsk /f /r C:` (replace `C:` with the appropriate drive letter if necessary).\n- If the drive is in use, you will be prompted to schedule the check for the next system reboot. Type `Y` for yes and restart your computer.\n\n### 2. Identify Processes Using a Specific Device or File\nTo find out what&#x27;s using the &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; or any particular device or file, you can use various tools. One of the more straightforward tools is Process Explorer by Sysinternals. Here\u2019s how to use it:\n\n- Download Process Explorer from the Microsoft Sysinternals website.\n- Run Process Explorer as an administrator.\n- Use the &quot;Find&quot; feature (under the &quot;Find&quot; menu or by pressing `Ctrl+F`) and enter the name of the device or file (like &quot;Stereo Mix&quot;).\n- Process Explorer will list any processes that have a handle open to that file or device.\n\n### 3. Managing Audio Devices and Troubleshooting\nSince you mentioned &quot;Stereo Mix&quot;, it seems to be an audio-related issue where the audio device might be used by another application:\n\n- **Disable and Re-enable the Device**: Go to the Sound settings (right-click on the sound icon in the system tray and select &quot;Sounds&quot;, then go to the &quot;Recording&quot; tab), find &quot;Stereo Mix&quot;, right-click it and select &quot;Disable&quot;, then &quot;Enable&quot; it again.\n- **Check Audio Applications**: Close applications that might be using audio services like media players, communication tools (Skype, Zoom), or browsers.\n\n### 4. Check for Background Applications\nSometimes, background applications or services might be using devices without explicit indications:\n\n- **Close Background Applications**: Use Task Manager to close applications that might be using your audio device.\n- **Restart**: If it&#x27;s unclear which application is causing the issue, a system restart can often free up the device.\n\nThese steps should help you identify and possibly resolve the issue of your volume being used by another process. If you continue to face difficulties, especially with &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; or running `chkdsk`, further specific diagnostics may be needed."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It might be indicative of a broader issue where certain system resources are being mistakenly flagged or improperly managed. Here are some steps to troubleshoot this specific problem:\n\n### 1. **Use Safe Mode**\nTo ensure that no third-party services or drivers are interfering with the disk check process, try running `chkdsk` from Safe Mode:\n\n- **Restart in Safe Mode**: \n  - Open the &quot;Start&quot; menu, click on the &quot;Power&quot; button, hold down the &quot;Shift&quot; key and click &quot;Restart.&quot;\n  - After your PC restarts to the &quot;Choose an option&quot; screen, select &quot;Troubleshoot&quot; &gt; &quot;Advanced options&quot; &gt; &quot;Startup Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Restart.&quot;\n  - Once your PC restarts again, you\u2019ll see a list of options. Press 4 or F4 to start your PC in Safe Mode.\n- **Run `chkdsk` in Safe Mode**: \n  - Open Command Prompt as Administrator (you can search for it, right-click, and select &quot;Run as administrator&quot;).\n  - Type `chkdsk /f /r C:` and press Enter. Since Safe Mode loads with minimal drivers and background processes, it should allow `chkdsk` to gain the necessary access without interference.\n\n### 2. **Check Audio Drivers and Services**\nSince the error is peculiarly related to audio, let\u2019s check if there\u2019s any issue with audio drivers or services:\n\n- **Update Audio Drivers**:\n  - Go to Device Manager (right-click on Start and select &quot;Device Manager&quot;).\n  - Expand the &quot;Sound, video and game controllers&quot; section, right-click on your audio device, and select &quot;Update driver&quot;.\n  - Follow the prompts to check for and install any driver updates.\n- **Restart Audio Services**:\n  - Press `Windows + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter.\n  - Look for services related to audio, such as &quot;Windows Audio&quot; and &quot;Windows Audio Endpoint Builder&quot;.\n  - Right-click on these services and select &quot;Restart&quot;.\n\n### 3. **Disable Audio Devices Temporarily**\nIf the above methods don\u2019t work, try disabling audio devices temporarily to run `chkdsk`:\n\n- **Disable Audio Devices**:\n  - Go to &quot;Sound settings&quot; (right-click the sound icon in the taskbar and select &quot;Open Sound settings&quot;).\n  - Under the &quot;Input&quot; and &quot;Output&quot; devices, select each device and choose &quot;Disable&quot;.\n\nAfter disabling, try running `chkdsk /f /r` again. If it runs without reporting that the audio is in use, you may have found the interfering component. Remember to enable your audio devices after running the disk check.\n\n### 4. **Perform a Clean Boot**\nPerforming a clean boot for your computer reduces conflicts related to software that can bring up the root causes of the problem by starting Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs:\n\n- **Configure a Clean Boot**:\n  - Type `msconfig` in the Run dialog (Windows + R).\n  - In the System Configuration window, on the &quot;General&quot; tab, click &quot;Selective startup&quot;.\n  - Uncheck &quot;Load startup items&quot;.\n  - On the &quot;Services&quot; tab, check &quot;Hide all Microsoft services&quot; and then click &quot;Disable all&quot;.\n  - Click &quot;OK&quot; and then &quot;Restart&quot; to apply the changes.\n\nIf `chkdsk` runs successfully after performing these steps, it indicates that third-party software or non-critical Windows services were interfering. To determine which service or application is the cause, gradually enable services and startup items and rerun `chkdsk` until you find the culprit.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues even after these steps, it might be necessary to consult with a professional to check for deeper system issues."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Here\u2019s how to address this:\n\n### Schedule `chkdsk` to Run at Boot\nSince the drive is in use, the best approach is to schedule `chkdsk` to run the next time your computer boots up. This way, it can access the drive before any files are in use:\n\n1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**:\n   - Search for &quot;cmd&quot; in the Start menu.\n   - Right-click on &quot;Command Prompt&quot; and select &quot;Run as administrator.&quot;\n\n2. **Schedule `chkdsk`**:\n   - In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:\n     ```\n     chkdsk C: /f /r\n     ```\n   - Replace `C:` with the letter of the drive you want to check if it&#x27;s not the C drive.\n   - You will likely see a message saying, &quot;Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)&quot;\n   - Type `Y` for yes and press Enter. This schedules the disk check.\n\n3. **Restart Your Computer**:\n   - Restart your computer. `chkdsk` will run before the operating system loads, allowing it to check and fix any issues found on the disk without interference from other processes.\n\n### Why This Is Necessary\nWhen Windows is running, certain system files are continuously in use, which prevents `chkdsk` from locking the drive to scan and repair it. By scheduling `chkdsk` during boot, it allows the tool to perform checks and repairs before these files are in use.\n\n### What to Expect\n- **Duration**: The `chkdsk /f /r` process can take a considerable amount of time, especially if the drive is large or has many issues to fix. The `/r` option locates bad sectors and recovers readable information, which adds to the time.\n- **After Completion**: Once the check is complete, Windows will continue to boot normally. If any issues were found and fixed, you might notice improved system stability or performance.\n\nIf you continue to have issues after running `chkdsk`, or if your system frequently reports that drives are in use when they shouldn&#x27;t be, there might be deeper Windows configuration issues or potentially failing hardware that needs to be addressed."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

To manage these:\n\n- **Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs**:\n  - Open Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc`).\n  - Go to the &quot;Startup&quot; tab.\n  - Review the list of programs and disable those that are unnecessary by right-clicking on them and selecting &quot;Disable&quot;.\n\n- **Configure System Services**:\n  - Type `msconfig` into the Run dialog (`Windows key + R`).\n  - Go to the &quot;Services&quot; tab.\n  - Check &quot;Hide all Microsoft services&quot; to prevent accidentally disabling essential services.\n  - Review the remaining services and uncheck those that are unnecessary or suspicious. Be cautious with this step to avoid disabling critical services.\n\n### 2. **Audio Driver Check**\nSince you mentioned hearing a sound immediately upon boot, it\u2019s a good idea to check your audio drivers and settings:\n\n- **Update Audio Drivers**:\n  - Open Device Manager (`Right-click the Start button &gt; Device Manager`).\n  - Expand &quot;Sound, video and game controllers&quot;.\n  - Right-click on your audio device and select &quot;Update driver&quot;. Follow the prompts to search automatically for updated driver software.\n\n- **Check Sound Settings**:\n  - Go to Sound settings (right-click the sound icon in the system tray and select &quot;Sounds&quot;).\n  - Under the &quot;Sounds&quot; tab, check the program events list to see if any sounds are configured to play at startup.\n\n### 3. **Perform a Clean Boot**\nTo determine if third-party software is causing the issue:\n\n- **Configure a Clean Boot**:\n  - Type `msconfig` into the Run dialog (`Windows key + R`).\n  - On the &quot;General&quot; tab, select &quot;Selective startup&quot;.\n  - Uncheck &quot;Load startup items&quot;.\n  - On the &quot;Services&quot; tab, select &quot;Hide all Microsoft services&quot;, then click &quot;Disable all&quot;.\n  - Click &quot;OK&quot; and restart your computer.\n\nThis setup starts Windows with the minimum necessary processes and can help identify if third-party software is causing the problem.\n\n### 4. **Listen to the Startup Sound**\nIdentifying the specific sound you hear at startup could provide clues about what might be initializing. Consider whether the sound might be coming from a hardware component (like a hard drive or fan), which could suggest a physical issue with the device.\n\n### 5. **Hardware Diagnostics**\nIf the sound seems to be more mechanical (like clicking or grinding from the hard drive), it&#x27;s important to perform hardware diagnostics:\n\n- Many computer manufacturers offer built-in diagnostics tools that you can access by pressing a specific key during boot (often F12 or similar). Check your computer manufacturer&#x27;s support site for specific instructions.\n\n### Conclusion\nThese steps should help isolate and possibly resolve the issue causing the sound and the &quot;volume in use&quot; message. If the problem persists after these steps, further investigation into specific hardware issues or deeper operating system configurations may be necessary."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This will allow you to share the audio playing on your computer with others in a chat room. Here are the steps to enable and configure Stereo Mix:\n\n### Step 1: Enable Stereo Mix\n1. **Open the Sound Control Panel**:\n   - Right-click on the sound/volume icon in the system tray (bottom-right corner of the screen).\n   - Click on &quot;Sounds&quot; or &quot;Open Sound settings.&quot; In the new window, scroll down and click on &quot;Sound Control Panel&quot; under Related Settings.\n\n2. **Switch to the Recording Tab**:\n   - In the Sound Control Panel, click on the &quot;Recording&quot; tab to see all available recording devices.\n\n3. **Enable Stereo Mix**:\n   - Look for &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; in the list. If you don\u2019t see it, right-click in an empty area of the window and check &quot;Show Disabled Devices&quot; and &quot;Show Disconnected Devices.&quot;\n   - Right-click on &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; and choose &quot;Enable.&quot; If &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; is not available, it might be due to your sound card drivers not supporting it, or it might be named differently (e.g., &quot;Wave Out Mix&quot; or &quot;What U Hear&quot; depending on the sound card).\n\n### Step 2: Set Stereo Mix as the Default Device\n1. **Set as Default**:\n   - Right-click on &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; and select &quot;Set as Default Device.&quot; This sets the Stereo Mix as the default recording input for all applications that use the default system settings.\n\n2. **Configure Stereo Mix (optional)**:\n   - Right-click on &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; again and select &quot;Properties.&quot; Here, you can adjust the levels and other settings to optimize sound quality. Make sure the levels are high enough to be audible but not too high to cause distortion.\n\n### Step 3: Configure Paltalk\n1. **Open Paltalk and Go to Settings**:\n   - Open Paltalk, and access the settings or preferences menu. This is typically found in the tools or options menus.\n\n2. **Select Audio Settings**:\n   - Look for audio settings where you can configure your microphone and speaker options.\n\n3. **Choose Stereo Mix as the Input Device**:\n   - In the microphone settings, select &quot;Stereo Mix&quot; as the input device. This will route all the audio playing on your computer to Paltalk.\n\n### Step 4: Test and Adjust\n1. **Test the Setup**:\n   - Start a chat and play some audio on your computer. The sound should now be transmitted through Paltalk. Ask other participants if they can hear the audio clearly.\n\n2. **Adjust as Necessary**:\n   - If the audio is too loud or too soft, adjust the levels either in the Stereo Mix properties in the Sound Control Panel or within Paltalk\u2019s settings.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- **No Stereo Mix**: If you can\u2019t find Stereo Mix, it may be due to outdated or basic sound drivers. Try updating your sound card drivers from the manufacturer\u2019s website.\n- **Audio Quality Issues**: If there are issues with sound quality, reduce or increase the Stereo Mix levels and check for any enhancements that may be interfering.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use Stereo Mix to share audio over Paltalk. If you encounter any specific issues during setup, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This is crucial as it tells the system to route all audio outputs (like music or system sounds) through Stereo Mix as an input for other applications.\n\n2. **Adjust Volume Levels**: Make sure the volume levels for Stereo Mix are set high enough to capture audio but not too high that it causes distortion. You can adjust this in the Stereo Mix properties under the &quot;Levels&quot; tab.\n\n### &quot;Listen to This Device&quot; Setting\n\nThe &quot;Listen to this device&quot; setting is primarily for monitoring the input device&#x27;s audio through your speakers or headphones. This isn&#x27;t necessary for Stereo Mix to function in broadcasting sound to other applications, but it can help you verify that Stereo Mix is actually picking up the sound:\n\n1. **Configure Listen Setting**:\n   - Go to the Sound Control Panel, and under the Recording tab, double-click on Stereo Mix to open its properties.\n   - Go to the &quot;Listen&quot; tab, check &quot;Listen to this device,&quot; and select your main playback device under &quot;Playback through this device.&quot;\n   - Click Apply and OK. Now, any sound that Stereo Mix picks should be audible through your speakers or headphones, helping you confirm it&#x27;s working.\n\n### Using Both Microphone and Stereo Mix\n\nIf you want to use your microphone alongside Stereo Mix (e.g., talking while music plays in the background), you&#x27;ll need to configure your software settings accordingly, as Windows usually allows only one default recording device:\n\n1. **Software Configuration**: Some applications like Paltalk might allow you to configure two different input sources, but this is rare. Typically, you would use additional software to mix both inputs (microphone and Stereo Mix) into a single virtual microphone. Programs like VoiceMeeter or a similar audio mixer software can achieve this.\n\n   - **Install an Audio Mixer**: Download and install an audio mixer application like VoiceMeeter.\n   - **Setup Audio Mixer**: Set your microphone and Stereo Mix as inputs in the audio mixer, and configure the mixer to output to a virtual device which then serves as your microphone input in Paltalk.\n\n2. **Testing**: Test the setup by playing audio and speaking into the microphone. Adjust levels in the audio mixer to balance your voice with the background music.\n\n### Additional Troubleshooting\n\n- **Driver Issues**: If Stereo Mix still isn&#x27;t working, consider updating your sound card drivers. Sometimes, specific features are only fully supported with the latest drivers.\n- **Application Settings**: Double-check application-specific settings (like in Paltalk) to ensure that the correct audio devices are selected and configured properly.\n\nUsing an audio mixer software is often the best solution when you need to combine multiple audio sources and manage them effectively for applications that do not natively support multiple audio inputs. This setup also allows for greater control over the individual audio levels and inputs."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

In this study we explore the co-evolution of \u2018lean and green thinking\u2019 and the potential for lean and green practices to enable successful transitions to sustainable business practice. Focusing on investigations into manufacturing SMEs in Queensland, Australia, we first establish four key enablers and six key barriers to sustainable business practice, derived from a series of in-depth interviews with Chief Executive Officers and senior managers involved in sustainability and lean manufacturing. We offer an institutional theory perspective on these findings, concluding the potential for normative, coercive and mimetic drivers to influence SMEs to shape environmental, social and economic decision making and legitimize the transition to sustainable business practice. We then present a novel \u2018Model of strategic enablers of sustainable business practice\u2019 to guide SMEs to intentionally use their lean and green strategies to successfully adopt sustainable business outcomes. We propose that through adopting lean and green thinking to transition to sustainable business practice, SMEs can more rapidly contribute to the circular economy at the level of firm. Agencies and professional bodies can support SMEs in this transition through targeted interventions that address the enablers and barriers presented.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;H.

Most of the discussion on this field is emphasized to address issues for larger organizations and very limited effort on small firms. The drivers and barriers of approaching sustainability practices in SMEs are different from those in large organizations since SMEs lack technical specialist, experience and money required to make such strategy. Since SMEs play a significant role in nation\u2019s economic growth, it is essential to study and find their drivers and barriers toward sustainability business practices constitutes main motivation of this paper. This is a primary finding that aims to understand the SME motivation and barriers that are facing in implementing green sustainable business practices to offer insight look to small firms to find key factors that influence adoption of sustainability business approach within their management practices. 1.0 Introduction In recent times, the firms have been more alert of their tasks to develop a sustainable product and services through green business practices (Freyman, 2011). Generally, large firms are more familiar with this approach compared to SMEs as they acquire more efficient management functionality and discipline and as well as decent financial constancy in compare to SMEs. It has been recorded that owner of small firms have limited knowledge toward green business due to limited conducted research in their business boundaries. Therefore, they are not aware of the impact such practices on business performance (Scraper et al., 2012). It is known that SME generate significant contribution to the national total economy growth and it can be perceived as the backbone of a nation\u2019s long term success with increase of green business essence are becoming the driving force to pushes the small firms in the manufacturing, industries or product and services around globe to merge sustainability concept with their core principles. According to the Australian and New Zealand government (2011), SMEs contributed around 60% of Australia\u2019s industrial value added in 2009\u201310. SMEs are playing an ever-increasing role in the national and regional economy. Also base on newest released state finding, SMEs in UK represent nearly 95% of services and industries sub sectors (UK Bureau of Statistics, 2014). The OECD economies, around 90% of business are constituted by small firms that is responsible for over 53% of total GDP. By contrast, in developing nations more than 90% of all businesses other than agricultural segments are shaped by micro or small enterprises. These small firms contribute significant economic output to the GDP. For instance, in Morocco 93% of all industrial firms are being run by small enterprises which contributes for 38% of production and $31 of investment and 36% of exports. This is very clear that impact of SMEs should not be undervalued (Salimzadeh, 2013). Marie-Franek (2012) in his report of research for innovative solution stated that SMEs are estimated to be responsible for 80 per cent of industry\u2019s destructive environmental impacts and more than 60 per cent of commercial waste. Clearly, conversations about sustainable business must include SMEs. SMEs can be defined by different characteristics including size, business structure, number of employees, age, net profit and ownership through innovative and technology (Katia, 2010. Most SMEs pursue one dimensional and traditional procedures which is a profit-oriented approach that ensure flexibility, instant feedback and short decision International Journal of Business and Economic Development Vol. 5 Number 1 March 2017 www.ijbed.org A Journal of the Academy of Business and Retail Management (ABRM) 42 making chains. However, the definition of SMEs vary from one nation to another, nonetheless they are considered as small private firms that are crucial in recruiting and profit contribution to GDP. More than half of these small firms implement simple procedure that enables well-rounded, instant response and brief and immediate decision making policy. In addition, SMEs deliver more comprehensible and faster feedback to clients\u2019 expectation compared to larger firms. The concept of green business or also known as sustainability business has helped to shape a new strategy management approach that apply different aims , norm and knowledge along with novelty to develop more competent and promising plan (Cohen,2009). As whole, a business that practices such approach, would cause a method to consume ideas with low environmental destruction and a process which are largely creative with almost zero resources waste and adulteration. They are many examples of such practices through green manufacturing that acts as block to resource waste and pollution that involves dropping resources, energy uses and recycling products and services to merge a process cycle which introduce using available limited resource as effective as possible that will not compromise future\u2019s needs for many years to come. Other example such practices can include ecofriendly energy, environmental product and services and training employees to be more educated about such practice to enhance the knowledge and recognize the benefit of green practices and threats of overusing such valuable resources (Majid, 2009). The drivers and barriers of this approach in SME are different to those in large and flat organizations since the small business have limited number of skill obligatory to start such approach (Carter, 2010).The environmental performance of SME is mostly encouraged by aim and goal of owners that run the business. It has been observed from literature and journals that there is limited available sources of studies that mainly concentrated on acknowledging of drivers and barriers of applying sustainability business practices in SMEs, particularly in a specific chosen state since each state or nation\u2019s SMEs require different strategy commensurate to their needs and challenges. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to find and analyze the identified barriers and drivers that influence application of such practices in SMEs. For this paper, the DEMATEL is used for this paper\u2019s methodology to collect and analysis from both academy and non-academy experts and list the drivers and barriers. 2.0 Literature Review 2.1 Definition of Sustainability Sustainability has defined differently base on the perspectives. While some have defined sustainability as conservative method to restore and preserve the nature resources that will be deficit in the future of living environment, other definitions are in relation to policy making. Burton (1987) gave one of the first definition of sustainability from implication and trade policy perception. He described sustainability as growth that is possible to continue without causing economic problems and development that is conceivable to proceed without creating economic issues and possible to sustain without causing environmental challenges. However, United Nations (1997) definition of sustainability seemed to be largely acceptable where the sustainability was explained as which \u201cmeets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own goals\u201d. Even though, several authors have identified this definition to be challenging where Taylor (2008) believes that the aspect of sustainability in its wide applications. Adams (2005) in his critic of UN definition, contended that it is commonly hard to decide the future needs in upcoming generations that might be changed than current time. He continued that the developed nations have different standpoint on needs of future which is different from interpretation of those developing nations. Anyhow, the definition that was given by UN raised controversies as it yet explains the two essential concerns: the continuous issues of ecological poverty that outcomes from economic progress, and the essence for such growth to reduce poverty in society (Lele, 2001). Barton (2004) present the three unified areas in a model to define the concept \u201csustainable development\u201d. Such areas as society, economy and the environment.

This stated that SME is an independent business, managed by its owner and having a small market share. The Bolton Report also adopted a number of different statistical definitions. The Bolton report also adopted of different statistical definition for instance yearly profit and figure of hired manpower. SMEs can be broken down to two separate segments: 1) Segments that is engages with manufacturing industries on physical and chemical products. 2) Segments on other goods and services. This contains ICT services as well as research development, logistics and private educations, agencies, installation and construction suppliers.

Nature has provided us with very valuable resources that we are accountable for, and it is only by protecting these resources that we improve our lives and those of future generations. From the literature, we know that small businesses are very slow in adopting environmentally sustainable practices (Masurel, 2006). While they are a significant contributor to pollution globally, only a few of them actively engage in actions to reduce their environmental impact.This paper focusses on the barriers that prevent small businesses from implementing environmentally sustainable practices. It discusses the importance of small businesses and their environmental impact on the economy. Next, it gives the theoretical rationale, a thorough discussion of the barriers that affect adoption of environmentally sustainable practices in small businesses, and ends with suggested resources.INTRODUCTIONWith the increased environmental awareness and the growing demand for environmental products and services, there is an upsurge of interest in environmental sustainability (popularly known as \\&quot;going green\\&quot;) among corporate managers and entrepreneurs (Schmitter, 2012). Several businesses have implemented a variety of sustainable practices, such as recycling, water conservation and energy-efficient management systems (Herren and Hadley, 2010). Colleges and Universities have started sustainability programs or are infusing sustainability into their programs and business organization sand are lobbying for support for small businesses to help them adopt green initiatives (Crals and Vereeck, n.d., and OECD, 2012). The United States government has launched several green initiatives, and through the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior has created and distributed various publications to help businesses implement environmentally sustainable practices (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2009).Despite these efforts, small businesses are still lagging behind the large companies which are increasingly integrating environmentally sustainable practices into their operations (Revell, Stokes and Chen, 2009). According to Revell and Rutherfoord (2003), there seems to be a lack of commitment by small business owner/mangers to reduce their negative environmental impact. Hillary (2000) also characterized them as resistant to voluntary action to reduce their environmental impacts, oblivious about the importance of sustainability, difficult to engage on topics relating to reducing their environmental impact, skeptical about the business benefits of sustainability, and cynical about the benefits of the assessment tools designed to improve environmental performance.Because of the importance of small businesses to the economy and the benefits of environmental sustainability to businesses and the environment, small businesses must play a critical role in resolving environmental problems. However, the small businesses that seek to implement sustainable practices face a number of barriers, which either do not exist for the large businesses or is very insignificant and therefore not a problem for them. Over the years significant efforts have been focused on the sustainability practices in large organizations, but little attention has been given to the challenges specific to small businesses (Herrin and Hadley, 2010).. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the importance of small businesses and their environmental impact on the economy, explain the rationale and benefits for small businesses implementing environmentally sustainable practices, discuss the barriers that prevent small businesses from adopting green initiatives and to offer possible strategies and to increase adoption of environmentally sustainability in small businesses. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;T.

Thirteen barriers were previously listed from the literature, and information about them was collected from 24 experienced managers who know the realities of small and medium-sized companies in the sector. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. The frequency distribution showed that in each barrier, there was more than 50% of the responses allocated in the upper range, that is, medium or intense observation, demonstrating that SMEs experience many difficulties in this theme. When comparatively analysed via Fuzzy TOPSIS, difficulties associated with lack of knowledge and financial resources/incentives that can support SMEs in adopting sustainable practices are highlighted. The main contribution of this study is to provide robust information that company managers and other researchers can use. In addition, the provided information can support more complex debates for structuring public policies.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Gilberto Cassoli de Oliveira Junior&quot;,&quot;Jefferson de Souza Pinto&quot;,&quot;I.

This abstract provides an overview of the importance of small businesses in sustainability. Small businesses are vital agents of change in fostering sustainability at the local and global levels. They have the flexibility and adaptability to implement sustainable practices in their operations, products, and services. By integrating environmentally friendly technologies, reducing waste, and adopting sustainable supply chain practices, small businesses can minimize their ecological footprint and contribute to the conservation of natural resources. Moreover, small businesses are often deeply rooted in their communities and have a direct impact on local economies and societies. Through responsible business practices, such as fair employment, supporting local suppliers, and engaging with the community, small businesses contribute to social sustainability. They provide employment opportunities, contribute to local economic development, and foster community well-being. Small businesses also have the potential to drive innovation in sustainability. Their size and agility allow them to experiment with new ideas and approaches, developing innovative products, services, and business models that align with sustainable principles. Small businesses can act as pioneers, demonstrating the viability and benefits of sustainable practices and inspiring larger organizations to follow suit. Furthermore, small businesses play a crucial role in promoting sustainable consumption and raising awareness among consumers. By offering environmentally friendly products and services, educating customers about sustainable choices, and promoting ethical and responsible consumption, small businesses contribute to shaping consumer behavior and preferences towards sustainability.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Fatma Ibrahim Abdelhalim Ibrahim&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2022,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;International Journal of Humanities and Language Research&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/role-small-businesses-sustainability-ibrahim/ea48b8fc02f15f4a8e62deb6dc11b361/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.21608/ijhlr.2023.215936.1014&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:5},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;What are the drivers and barriers for green business practice adoption for SMEs?&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;The depletion of natural resources as a byproduct of widespread, global economic growth has urged entrepreneurs to think about the environment when starting or conducting business. However, several of these smaller-sized firms struggle with implementing environmentally conscious business practices, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which represent more than 95% of all private sector firms. This study uses a survey method to assess and better comprehend the key drivers and barriers of green business practices by SMEs in the State of Ohio (USA). Results from our study show that a majority of respondents reported that they have implemented green practices, broadly defined, within their business. The two main drivers for deciding to engage in such practices are internal motivations and the opportunity to obtain a better public image. However, respondents also noted a lack of capital as the central barrier to implementing green business practices. We also observe that smaller firms, and firms located in urban areas, are more familiar with green business practices than larger firms and firms that are located in rural areas. Our results can be used by government and business actors alike, especially in states comparable to Ohio, as a benchmark to consider better strategies, programs, and policies for implementing green business techniques. Overall, this research helps to better discern best practices and ways to develop more prosperous SMEs without undermining the quality of the environment.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J. A.

However it is still unclear what this term actually means in day to day operations. This study identifies key characteristics of sustainable business practice for SMEs through evaluating the experiences of senior decision makers from 13 companies engaged in lean and green practices in Queensland, Australia. Through a systematic literature review and an exploratory study, nine characteristics emanating from the three themes of environmental stewardship, process excellence, and sustainability oriented-culture were established. Furthermore, this study build on natural-resource-based view (NRBV) theory to present a \u2018Natural Resources Based View Plus\u2019 (\u2018NRBV+\u2019) model that includes an additional strategy of \u2018regenerative development\u2019. These findings can immediately assist SMEs to evaluate their practices, and in doing so, identify sustainability performance improvement opportunities. It is proposed that these findings also have implications for addressing the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goal of responsible consumption and production.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;H.

Companies have started developing and implementing these practices in their business models. However, several challenges influence the adoption of sustainability and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study aimed (i) to identify the adoption barriers of sustainability and I4.0 and (ii) to establish the interrelationship among these barriers for SMEs. An extensive literature search supported by interviews with supply chain practitioners from three SMEs identified 12 critical barriers to adoption. The barriers are then ranked using \u2018Interpretive Structural Modeling\u2019. The results suggest that the \u2018lack of resources\u2019 and the \u2018lack of employee\u2019s competence/expertise\u2019 are the most influencing barriers. Changing government regulations on the allocation of capital and financial incentives for SMEs to encourage training and skills development programs could promote sustainable supply chains and practices. The study also reflects short-, medium- and long-term planning strategies for supply chain practitioners for adoption of sustainability and I4.0 in SMEs.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Shashank P.

Indian Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises are facing the competition posed by rising technological advances in the market. Thus, Industry 4.0 intervention shall be highly useful in this context. This study assesses the barriers involved in implementing Industry 4.0 for sustainable production, and it attempts to find causality among the barriers using the \u2018Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory\u2019 method. The study considers eight barriers to implement Industry 4.0 for sustainable production. These barriers are inter-related and have causal relationships among them. This causality is represented graphically. The applied method delineates barriers under consideration for causality into two groups, namely; \u2018influencer\u2019 and \u2018influenced.\u2019 It also illustrates the strength of the influence of one barrier over the other through numerical values. The prime contribution of this study is to not only find the influencing barriers but also to mitigate them by allocating scarce organizational resources. Mitigating the influencing barriers would help in managing the influenced challenges. \u2018Technological upgradation\u2019, \u2018lack of policy frameworks\u2019 are the top two barriers that find its place in the hierarchy of importance established by this study. These barriers are also classified into the \u2018cause\u2019 group. Also, this study establishes that \u2018difficulty in access to credit\u2019 and \u2018non-readiness of the workforce\u2019 in adopting Industry 4.0 are \u2018influenced\u2019 barriers. This study shall be of importance to the small business practitioners and government analysts in evaluating barriers in implementing sustainable production initiatives using Industry 4.0. With this, Indian Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprise needs to upgrade by upskilling young working population for the forthcoming technological revolution of Industry 4.0. Finally, we suggest several important implications for managers and policymakers.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Akshay G. Khanzode&quot;,&quot;P. Sarma&quot;,&quot;S.

Sourcing from small businesses also has implications for the governance of sourcing processes and can benefit from a partnership approach. Barriers to public sector sourcing from small businesses are discussed and suggestions made on how these can be overcome.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;H.

A mixed methodology was adopted, using a questionnaire survey and interviews with 20 manufacturing companies in Guangzhou and Shenzen. Evidence from the small sample of companies demonstrates the lack of significant sustainable development practices in China, although small and medium sized companies appeared to show interest in this area and would like to further contribute to for example triple bottom line objectives. Increasing concerns are found from the company level regarding the need to use renewable energy, source alternative sustainable materials, close the loop of the supply chain, improve the quality of products produced rather than reducing cost, export to Europe and treat employees as an asset. The lack of skills, finance and knowledge are found to be prohibiting the effective embedment of sustainable development within companies and hence cause an under-performance in this regard. The study concludes that the establishing of a new business model for sustainable development in China is needed urgently, and this should be a joint effort with the Chinese government.

While firms invest in green production and green supply chain activities with the primary purpose of reducing their environmental impact, the reciprocal relationships with economic performance need to be clarified. Would firms and suppliers adjust their environmental strategies if the higher economic value that environmental management generates is reinvested in greening actions? We found out that environmental management positively influences economic performance as second order (long term) target, to be reached conditioned by higher environmental performance; in addition, firms can increase their performance if they reinvest the higher economic value gained through environmental management in green practices: While investing in environmental management programs is a short term strategy, economic rewards can be obtained only with some delays. Consequently, environmental management is an economically sustainable business only for patient firms. In the evaluation of these reciprocal relationships, we discovered that green supply chain initiatives are more effective and more economically sustainable than internal actions.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Antje Gotschol&quot;,&quot;Pietro De Giovanni&quot;,&quot;Vincenzo Esposito Vinzi&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:2014,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Journal of environmental management&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/management-economically-business-gotschol/d2a8a9781bc15325a800d01eb3cd4659/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.05.001&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;144&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;\\n          73-82\\n        &quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:12},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Sustainable Entrepreneurship: The Role of Perceived Barriers and Risk&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Entrepreneurs who start a business to serve both self-interests and collective interests by addressing unmet social and environmental needs are usually referred to as sustainable entrepreneurs. Compared with regular entrepreneurs, we argue that sustainable entrepreneurs face specific challenges when establishing their businesses owing to the discrepancy between the creation and appropriation of private value and social value. We hypothesize that when starting a business, sustainable entrepreneurs (1) feel more hampered by perceived barriers, such as the institutional environment and (2) have a different risk attitude and perception than regular entrepreneurs. We use two waves of the Flash Eurobarometer survey on entrepreneurship (2009 and 2012), which contains information on start-up motivations, start-up barriers, and risk perceptions of approximately 3000 (prospective) business owners across 33 countries. We find that sustainable entrepreneurs indeed perceive more institutional barriers in terms of a lack of financial, administrative, and informational support at business start-up than regular entrepreneurs. Further, no significant differences between sustainable and regular entrepreneurs are found in terms of their risk attitudes or perceived financial risks. However, sustainable entrepreneurs are more likely to fear personal failure than regular entrepreneurs, which is explained by their varied and complex stakeholder relations. These insights may serve as an important signal for both governments and private capital providers in enhancing the institutional climate.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;B.

For this purpose, a search equation was designed, and the 50 highest cited articles from the search results in Scopus between years 2013 and 2017 were reviewed. The selected criteria for the article analysis were article name, article year, country, continent, journal, Scimago Journal Rank, Scimago Quartiles, Affiliated Universities, abstract, and keywords. Among the main results, 175 barriers to sustainability for SMEs were identified. The barriers that appeared most frequently were lack of resources, the high initial capital cost of implementing sustainability measures, and lack of expertise. At the end of the article, a proposal is included which shows the 175 identified barriers, classified by \u201csector,\u201d \u201csustainability tool,\u201d and \u201cinternal/external\u201d which can aid in new qualitative and quantitative studies of barriers to sustainability in SMEs.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;J.

Firms are considered responsible for social and environmental effects but are also considered as social actors that can effectively incorporate sustainability solutions into market transactions. The literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in small business has depicted these firms as less involved in sustainability management implementation owing to resource constraints and limited perception of the business case for sustainability. Further, studies on both small business and sustainable entrepreneurship have highlighted the pivotal role of entrepreneurs\u2019 values in motivating a more sustainable way of conducting business while, large companies, driven by external pressures, are more focused on a strategic CSR approach than small firms. Starting from these premises, the paper aims to identify the main drivers or barriers of sustainability implementation and to verify any significant differences between small and large-sized companies in their approach to sustainability practices implementation. The study adopts a qualitative research method based on semi-structured interviews addressing 22 participants from Italian firms of different sizes selected for their social and environmental commitment. The findings of the study highlight the existence of some common features among small and large firms, in particular, regarding motivations, entrepreneur values, and business vision, contributing new perspectives to the sustainable entrepreneurship debate.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;S.

Acknowledging the immensity of sustainability challenges, this article takes a different perspective, arguing that without understanding of concrete barriers and seeking solutions, the challenge of addressing unsustainable practices becomes unsurmountable. This article will summarize research in sustainability literature that indicates that sustainability requires a constant human population, as well as ecologically benign method of production. This article will survey a number of helpful frameworks that address the key obstacles to sustainability, namely population growth, and unsustainable production and consumption. These frameworks are discussed in the context of business-level solutions and production systems. As illustrated by examples of best practices as well as potential pitfalls associated with each system, these systems have the potential to move the quest for sustainability beyond \u2018business as usual.\u2019&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;H.

However, most of these businesses have not yet mastered ways of implementing sustainability practices. This article explores the potential barriers that prevent SMEs from improving sustainability performances through a study of a physiotherapy center in Hong Kong. Semi\u2010structured interviews were conducted to gain an understanding of existing practices, which were put under the lens of a sustainability maturity level model. Challenges in relation to the leadership, guideline developments, communications, and measurements were then highlighted. The results provide insight into barriers to sustainable practices of small health\u2010care facilities and shed light on ways they could move forward with the targeted sustainability initiatives. The results may also be applicable to SMEs in other sectors.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;W. K. ChuKevin&quot;,&quot;L. W.

In this context, adopting sustainable manufacturing (SM) practices still represents a challenge, especially for small and medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). In order to address this issue, this study identified a set of barriers to SM implementation. The main findings reveal that there is limited research on SM from Latin American (LATAM) countries, and the majority of published articles discuss the implementation of lean tools and cleaner production in industry. Additionally, results showed that the biggest challenges that Uruguayan companies have to face are associated with economic and financial barriers. A new categorization of barriers: human perceptions, resource constraints and weak legislation was presented. Finally, the study examines the adoption of SM practices in the country, with cleaner production and product recovery being the most implemented practices. This study concludes that there is an urgent need for government institutions, academia, and organizations to align their objectives and work together in order to support SMEs in their transition towards sustainability.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;M.

One of the fundamental questions is how a single economic entity, especially a small-scale enterprise, can be engaged in the uptake of sustainability practices. This question is particularly pertinent to New Zealand, where 98% of enterprises are SMEs. In this paper questions are raised about the conventional models of \u2018business ethics\u2019 and accountability and their relevance to SMEs. The paper reports on actual practices and discusses the possibility of small enterprises having accountability for their social and environmental impacts. Ways of linking individual firm activities to sustainability, such as a communitarian model of accountability, are discussed and illustrated.

Your evaluation of the dried fish industry was astute and nuanced, particularly your observations surrounding how the economic positioning of the fisherfolk influences their regulatory compliance when it interferes with their income-earning possibilities (Davidas, para. 2). However, often a key barrier to sustainable practices is economic access. Often sustainable practices come with huge price tags that small businesses simply cannot afford. According to research, the high costs of implementing sustainable practices are a major barrier for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is due to the significant initial capital required, alongside a lack of technical expertise and resources within smaller businesses. Studies highlight that while these practices can offer long-term savings and efficiency gains, the upfront expenses and complex implementation processes deter many SMEs from adopting such measures ([Caldera, Desha, &amp; Dawes, 2019](https://consensus.app/papers/evaluating-enablers-barriers-implementation-business-caldera/613bfd27b8215781b62515c9e530819d/?utm_source=chatgpt); [Aghelie, 2017](https://consensus.app/papers/exploring-drivers-barriers-sustainability-business-aghelie/b58cd7a1a1845a089531b643334f6f35/?utm_source=chatgpt); [McEwen, 2013](https://consensus.app/papers/examination-barriers-that-impact-implementation-mcewen/3d3c1d9d5a6b5c21a237b00b21c8fd74/?utm_source=chatgpt)).

After reviewing the growth of organized interest in local environmental issues, one prominent type of local group, amenity societies, is considered in detail, including typical styles of action, resources, ethos, and social composition. It is suggested that the evident effectiveness of many amenity societies may preclude other environmental groups with different social compositions from influencing official planning policies. With growing emphasis on public participation in statutory planning, serious problems of the equity of distribution of amenity and accessibility arise because certain areas and sections of society are not organized to protect their interests in the environment; certain sections of the community lack the available resources to sustain effective pressure group activity; and some local political cultures are unreceptive to group activity. The problems of political equity, the representativeness of local environmental groups, variations in potential political efficacy between existing groups, and the failure of certain interests to achieve political expression are each considered in detail. It is concluded that the medium of political organization will magnify the differences and inequalities of the social structure, and that the activities of local environmental pressure groups will tend to accentuate existing disparities between the favoured environments of the powerful and wealthy and the degraded environments of the deprived.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Philip Lowe&quot;],&quot;paper_publish_year&quot;:1977,&quot;publication_journal_name&quot;:&quot;Environment and Planning A&quot;,&quot;consensus_paper_details_url&quot;:&quot;https://consensus.app/papers/amenity-equity-review-local-environmental-pressure-lowe/b1c0e38e607a5dc384a8c8a8051fd9e0/?utm_source=chatgpt&quot;,&quot;doi&quot;:&quot;10.1068/a090035&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;9&quot;,&quot;pages&quot;:&quot;35 - 58&quot;,&quot;search_result_number&quot;:2},{&quot;paper_title&quot;:&quot;Managing a new collaborative entity in business organizations: understanding organizational communities of practice effectiveness.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Companies worldwide are turning to organizational communities of practice (OCoPs) as vehicles to generate learning and enhance organizational performance. OCoPs are defined as groups of employees who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic and who strengthen their knowledge and expertise by interacting on a consistent basis. To date, OCoP research has drawn almost exclusively from the community of practice (CoP) literature, even though the organizational form of CoPs shares attributes of traditional CoPs and of organizational teams. Drawing on Lave and Wenger&#x27;s (1991) original theory of legitimate peripheral participation, we integrate theory and research from CoPs and organizational teams to develop and empirically examine a model of OCoP effectiveness that includes constructs such as leadership, empowerment, the structure of tasks, and OCoP relevance to organizational effectiveness. Using data from 32 OCoPs in a U.S.-based multinational mining and minerals processing firm, we found that external community leaders play an important role in enhancing OCoP empowerment, particularly to the extent that task interdependence is high. Empowerment, in turn, was positively related to OCoP effectiveness. We also found that OCoPs designated as \\&quot;core\\&quot; by the organization (e.g., working on critical issues) were more effective than those that were noncore. Task interdependence also was positively related to OCoP effectiveness. We provide scholars and practitioners with insights on how to effectively manage OCoPs in today&#x27;s organizations.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Bradley L Kirkman&quot;,&quot;J.

In seeking to address this problem it is clear from the literature that there is considerable potential in catalyzing collective action, particularly where there is a moral imperative to act and the availability of leaders with the ability to organize the collective. However, while there is evidence that community-based collective action has provided effective localized solution pathways for managing collective goods when the focus has been on the distribution of benefits, there is little evidence about its potential in scenarios associated with the distribution of costs, or responsibilities. In addressing this asymmetry, we present a case study of a typical village near Shanghai which has successfully established a community based environmental management system, and describe the process, characteristics and influencing factors of its responsibility-centered collective action. Our findings show that smart local leadership, an effective organizing strategy, and involvement of a suitable \u2018core group\u2019 was crucial. The strategy of mobilizing this core group, of empowering them with decision-making rights, and supporting their volunteered role as a \u2018bridge and platform\u2019 connecting the village cadres and villagers, significantly reduced the enforcement and monitoring costs, controlled free rider problems, and gained public support and participation, leading to a stable and sustainable solution. Our findings illustrate specific principles that apply to many cases in China, and general principles that are likely to be applicable more widely.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Pingyang Liu&quot;,&quot;Ye Zhao&quot;,&quot;N.

We draw from two theoretical approaches \u2013 behavioural and institutional \u2013 that offer different answers to the question: what makes community groups thrive? Based on an analysis of 386 community groups in the Netherlands, we distinguish four types of groups: feather light, cooperative, networked and nested groups. Then, in a neighbourhood case study we focus on the relations between groups and local institutions to gain a deeper insight into the institutional dynamics of urban governance. Moreover, we combine the findings of both studies claiming that different groups need different things from local institutions, and that in the current NPM-driven world only the higher educated community groups have productive relationships with local institutions, while others are somewhere in between frail contacts and failing demands.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Mandy de Wilde&quot;,&quot;Menno Hurenkamp&quot;,&quot;E.

The obvious questions, then, are what makes strong neighborhoods and what can be done to build that strength? People who have access to GIS (geographic information systems) have come to feel they might have a resource that could help neighborhoods by providing maps and geographic information. In fact, because of the complications and expense of using GIS, community groups have often gone to a GIS expert to get the resources they need. This relationship is documented in an earlier paper by the senior author (Sawicki and Craig 1996). When that earlier work was about to go to press, the two authors asked themselves, \\&quot;What do community groups do with this information?\\&quot; They provided a few general answers, but had no overall framework to present. To answer the question about community use of information, new research was undertaken; the results of that effort are presented in this paper.(1) Cities are Social Organisms Individual neighbors affect one&#x27;s quality of life and thereby one&#x27;s sense of the quality of the city (Jacobs 1961). But equally important is the neighborhood as a whole, and especially neighborhood and community organizations. The city is a social cauldron where different groups struggle to define the nature of that particular place as well as of their society. Castells (1983) argues that grass-roots organizations are a critical part of that struggle, documenting their influence across many cultures. Only by organizing can individuals have the impetus to participate in the traditional power structure. In order to be effective, community groups need to inspire others to appreciate their situation and proposed solutions. The power base of a community group comes from the size and commitment of its membership. Its success is measured by how many resources it has and how much positive change it is able to bring to its community. Accordingly, there are two types of audiences who must be inspired: the community itself (internal) and those who control the resources (external). Maps and geographic information can play an effective role in the success of a community group. Durrance (1983) argues that information is the key to successful community organizations; they gain credibility by providing it to their members, the public, and policy makers. More than that, information can make the community groups internally more efficient and can act as a critical resource in buying a role for the group in any external coalition building. How and Why Do Community Groups Use Maps and Geographic Information in Their Work? To answer this question in detail, we reviewed literature from many fields: planning, political science, communications, social movement, social psychology, and community development. And to balance theory with practice, we interviewed community leaders who use maps and geographic information. Our goal was to develop a conceptual framework for the use of information which could be a useful guide to GIS specialists and community groups seeking to enhance the social, political, and economic situation of their neighborhoods. Geographic information thus becomes a tool for empowerment. Nature of Community Groups Community groups have become important in American politics for a number of reasons.(2) From a philosophical perspective, Americans generally believe that power comes from individuals and that organizations of individuals add to that strength.(3) From a practical perspective, planners have come to realize that people in the community know more about local problems and, when properly mobilized, are quite effective at bringing about positive change (Jones 1990). From a political perspective, the decline of monolithic sources of power, such as the political party, has led to the rise of pluralism, where many groups have a role in the power base (Judge et al. 1995). In this era of pluralism, coalitions of diverse groups are formed to gain a common goal. \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;W. Craig&quot;,&quot;S.

We explore pathways between community participation and HIV prevention, treatment and impact mitigation in Zimbabwe, reviewing six qualitative studies in Manicaland. These find that community group membership is often (not always) associated with decreased HIV incidence, reduced stigma and improved access to some services, particularly amongst women. Participation in formal community groups (e.g., church or women&#x27;s groups) and informal local networks (e.g., neighbours, families) provides opportunities for critical dialogue about HIV/AIDS, often facilitating renegotiation of harmful social norms, sharing of previously hidden personal experiences of HIV/AIDS, formulation of positive action plans and solidarity to action them. However, implementation of new plans and insights is constrained by poverty, social uncertainty and poor service delivery. Furthermore, dialogue may have negative effects, spreading false information and entrenching negative norms. The extent that formal groups and informal networks facilitate externally imposed HIV/AIDS interventions varies. They potentially provide vital practical and emotional support, facilitating service access, treatment adherence and AIDS care. However, they may sometimes play a negative role in prevention activities, challenging stereotypes about sexuality or gender. There is an urgent need for greater recognition of the role of indigenous community groups and networks, and the inclusion of \u201cstrengthening local responses\u201d as a key element of interventions and policy. Such efforts require great sensitivity. Heavy-handed external interference in complex indigenous relationships risks undermining the localism and bottom\u2013up initiative and activism that might be central to their effectiveness. Cautious efforts might seek to enhance the potentially beneficial effects of groups, especially for women, and limit potentially damaging ones, especially for men. Efforts should be made to facilitate contexts that enable groups to have beneficial effects, through nesting them within wider comprehensive responses, and supporting them through strong partnerships with service providers.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;C.

Data were examined through a cluster analysis that identified four issue orientation patterns across a set of 20 survey items.

Local civic action comprises situations in which community members come together\u2014typically with support from local organizations\u2014to address common issues. The collective orientation of local civic action makes it sensitive to changes in local social conditions. As these changes unfold, local organizations become differentially able to support civic action. Here, our core argument features the process through which community members associate with different local organizations and how mandated versus voluntary association results in distinct responses to increased social and economic heterogeneity. We test this argument using three decades of data describing local campaigns of the annual Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF program. A baseline model shows that within-county increases in racial diversity and income inequality are associated with diminished campaign effectiveness. Subsequent models that separate out campaigns organized by schools, churches, and clubs show that schools are relatively more effective mobilizers as racial diversity and income inequality increase, arguably due to the greater demographic matching that is induced by mandated school participation.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Wesley Longhofer&quot;,&quot;G.

This study examines whether citizen participation in neighborhood organizations located in poor communities is related to neighborhood and organizational collective efficacy among residents. The results indicate that the more residents participated in their neighborhood organization, the greater their level of organizational collective efficacy, but not neighborhood collective efficacy. The results of the current study will help support social workers and other community practitioners understand how to effectively facilitate citizen participation in ways that enhance collective efficacy in poor communities. Implications for social work practice and research are discussed. Keywords: neighborhood collective efficacy, organizational collective efficacy, citizen participation, neighborhood organizations, poor communities, community practice, community level research ********** In recent years, there has been a revitalization of community-based social work strategies that seek to enhance citizen participation and build the capacity of residents to address problems in poor communities (Johnson, 1998; Schott, 1997; Weft, 1996). These strategies have been used to confront a variety of issues, including those that pertain to at-risk youth, unemployment, affordable housing, crime and safety, and urban blight (Chaskin, Brown, Venkatesh &amp; Vidal, 2001; Murphy &amp; Cunningham, 2003). Citizen participation is the active, voluntary involvement of individuals and groups to change problematic conditions in poor communities, and influence the policies and programs that affect the quality of their lives or the lives of other residents (Gamble &amp; Weil, 1995). Citizen participation has enhanced the effectiveness of community-based social work strategies by strengthening resident participation in democratic processes, assisting groups in advocating for their needs, and building organizational and community problem-solving resources and capacities (Chaskin, et al., 2001; Johnson, 1998; Schorr, 1997; Weil, 1996). Despite the potential of citizen participation, the barriers to facilitating it can be substantial, including the multiple demands on an individual&#x27;s time. Wandersman and Florin (2001) argue that a major resource of small voluntary organizations, such as neighborhood organizations, is the participation of its members, including their time and energy which must be mobilized into active involvement and performance of tasks. Therefore, it is important that residents believe they have the capacity to make a difference. Collective efficacy is a term used to describe residents&#x27; perceptions regarding their ability to work with their neighbors to intervene in neighborhood issues to maintain social control and solve problems (Wandersman &amp; Florin, 2000). Collective efficacy is a broad term and can be conceptualized as both a neighborhood and organizational process. Neighborhood collective efficacy is defined as the connection of mutual trust and social cohesion along with shared expectations for intervening in support of neighborhood social control (Sampson &amp; Raudenbush, 1999). Organizational collective efficacy is defined as an organization or group&#x27;s perception of its problem-solving skills and its ability to improve the lives its members (Pecukonis &amp; Wenocur, 1994). While there is considerable research demonstrating the positive effects of neighborhood collective efficacy on neighborhood conditions, including crime and safety (Sampson, Morenoff &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 2002; Sampson &amp; Groves, 1989; Rankin &amp; Quane, 2002), less is know about the connection between citizen participation and neighborhood and organizational collective efficacy (Chavis, Florin, Rich &amp; Wandersman, 1987; Perkins, Brown &amp; Taylor, 1996; Sampson &amp; Raudenbush, 1997). \u2026&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Mary L.

Community-based approaches are supported because citizens have local knowledge, understand local conditions, can practice direct democracy, and can help develop solutions to problems of integrated and sustainable forest management. However, there is little information available to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based strategies. This study evaluates how well three participatory techniques-a mail survey, focused conversations with existing community groups, and community dinners-meet three key community oriented criteria: representativeness, working toward identification of communitywide common good, and incorporation of values and beliefs into the discussion.

How, then, do such groups remain viable\u2014even thriving\u2014organizations? Building upon research on organizational theory and social movements, we examine patterns of survival among a sample of community-based organizations (CBOs) between 1990 and 2004, thus providing the first systematic study of their long-term mortality processes. More specifically, we test how organizations&#x27; sociopolitical legitimacy and resources (and strategies for cultivating both) influence survival, finding that the legitimacy of organizations in low-income areas is a double-edged sword, as embeddedness in resource-deprived local environments confers both benefits and disadvantages. In particular, we find the strongest support for the notion that, beyond the considerable effects of externally obtained resources, CBOs also benefit considerably by engaging in even a small amount of grassroots fundraising. Further, although we find significant effects of extra-local legitimacy in the baseline models\u2014through organizations&#x27; affiliation with national or regional organizing networks\u2014we find evidence in additional analyses that the survival benefits of network affiliation are largely mediated by resources. We also find sizable but marginally significant effects of local legitimacy, and significant positive effects of organizational age and urban location. Overall, our findings suggest that although cultivating resources is the surest path to survival, organizations that build their legitimacy will be in a better position to compensate for structural resource deficits.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;E.

While the term \u2018community\u2019 is often used without clear definition or context, it can be viewed as a group of people emerging through social interaction. Through a series of collaborative action toward a shared goal, a community of practice can be formed. This paper proposes a hypothetical framework of integrated local environmental knowledge (ILEK), and applies it to analyze the processes of collaborative actions in the case of the Nishibetsu Watershed in Hokkaido, Japan. The case study identified several phases of actions, all initiated by a group of local residents on a grassroots and voluntary basis. These local resident-initiated collaborative actions had a particular confluence of elements to facilitate gradual strengthening of formal and informal institutions in the watershed scale beyond jurisdictional boundaries, making this a worthy case to study. The local residents used diverse types of knowledge, including livelihood-based technologies and skills of working as a group and with local governments, for establishing and strengthening various institutions for collaborative actions, with such knowledge being used in the manner of tools in a box of bricolage for community formation.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;Kenji Kitamura&quot;,&quot;C.

Engaging members of disadvantaged communities in public health initiatives has been suggested as a way to reduce health inequities. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions that engage the community on a range of health outcomes across diverse health issues.MethodsWe searched the following sources for systematic reviews of public health interventions: Cochrane CDSR and CENTRAL, Campbell Library, DARE, NIHR HTA programme website, HTA database, and DoPHER. Through the identified reviews, we collated a database of primary studies that appeared to be relevant, and screened the full-text documents of those primary studies against our inclusion criteria. In parallel, we searched the NHS EED and TRoPHI databases for additional primary studies. For the purposes of these analyses, study design was limited to randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Only interventions conducted in OECD countries and published since 1990 were included. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of health behaviour, health consequences, self-efficacy, and social support outcomes, and a narrative summary of community outcomes. We tested a range of moderator variables, with a particular emphasis on the model of community engagement used as a potential moderator of intervention effectiveness.ResultsOf the 9,467 primary studies scanned, we identified 131 for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size for health behaviour outcomes is d\u2009=\u2009.33 (95% CI .26, .40). The interventions were also effective in increasing health consequences (d\u2009=\u2009.16, 95% CI .06, .27); health behaviour self-efficacy (d\u2009=\u2009.41, 95% CI .16, .65) and perceived social support (d\u2009=\u2009.41, 95% CI .23, .65). Although the type of community engagement was not a significant moderator of effect, we identified some trends across studies.ConclusionsThere is solid evidence that community engagement interventions have a positive impact on a range of health outcomes across various conditions. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether one particular model of community engagement is more effective than any other.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

In the Seattle metropolitan region, residents of 20 different local areas recognize three different means as relatively equal in importance. These include neighbors, community clubs, and representatives of the society&#x27;s authority structure such as government. Across communities, reliance on neighbors and the authority structure seems to be a functional alternative to dependence on community clubs as problem-solving institutions. What we believe to be the relatively strong forms of representation-community clubs-are especially recognized in parts of the metropolis with clear name definitions and homogeneous residential land use. Rated effectiveness of institutions seems to be more similar across communities than the means of representation; it is more directly related to the wealth of the area and the types of social issues faced by the community.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;A.

Yet, researchers and managers are divided regarding the effectiveness of these measures. The \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d model is often accepted as a universal paradigm, which assumes that unless managed by the State or privatized, common-pool resources are inevitably overexploited due to conflicts between the self-interest of individuals and the goals of a group as a whole. Under this paradigm, the emergence and maintenance of effective community-based efforts that include cooperative risky decisions as the establishment of marine reserves could not occur. In this paper, we question these assumptions and show that outcomes of commons dilemmas can be complex and scale-dependent. We studied the evolution and effectiveness of a community-based management effort to establish, monitor, and enforce a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Our findings build on social and ecological research before (1997\u20132001), during (2002) and after (2003\u20132004) the establishment of marine reserves, which included participant observation in &gt;100 fishing trips and meetings, interviews, as well as fishery dependent and independent monitoring. We found that locally crafted and enforced harvesting rules led to a rapid increase in resource abundance. Nevertheless, news about this increase spread quickly at a regional scale, resulting in poaching from outsiders and a subsequent rapid cascading effect on fishing resources and locally-designed rule compliance. We show that cooperation for management of common-pool fisheries, in which marine reserves form a core component of the system, can emerge, evolve rapidly, and be effective at a local scale even in recently organized fisheries. Stakeholder participation in monitoring, where there is a rapid feedback of the systems response, can play a key role in reinforcing cooperation. However, without cross-scale linkages with higher levels of governance, increase of local fishery stocks may attract outsiders who, if not restricted, will overharvest and threaten local governance. Fishers and fishing communities require incentives to maintain their management efforts. Rewarding local effective management with formal cross-scale governance recognition and support can generate these incentives.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R. Cudney-Bueno&quot;,&quot;X.

Or building rural community? Community watershed organizations in Pennsylvania.&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Recent initiatives from state and federal government agencies have helped foster the formation of community-based watershed organizations. Although there is a great deal of enthusiasm about the potential of these organizations to enhance water quality, relatively little attention has been paid to the impacts these organizations may have on the well-being of rural communities more generally. Assessments of effectiveness have typically focused on specific activities and accomplishments, rather than a broader range of community-based effects. In short, we ask whether community-based environmental management improves community as well as environment. Our research utilized a mixed-methods design, including a statewide mail survey of all Pennsylvania watershed organizations, followed by in-depth interviews with 28 rural watershed organizations. This sequential approach progressively explored in more detail definitions of effectiveness, including the building of rural capacity. We find watershed organizations are potentially effective mechanisms for building local leadership, enhancing the skill so f rural residents, and making valuable connections with other communities, facing similar water-resource and rural-development issues. However, the range of issues with which local watershed organizations engage and the methods they currently utilize may eventually limit their usefulness.&quot;,&quot;paper_authors&quot;:[&quot;R.

They may require different machinery or less efficient processes because they are not produced at the same scale as conventional plastics.\n\n3. **Economies of Scale**: Since sustainable materials are generally less common, they lack the economies of scale that help reduce the cost of more widely used materials. However, as demand for eco-friendly products increases, these costs may decrease.\n\n4. **Long-term Costs and Savings**: Companies like Pela might also consider the long-term financial benefits of using sustainable materials, such as enhanced brand loyalty, the ability to market products as eco-friendly, and potential subsidies or tax benefits for using greener materials.\n\nOverall, while the initial costs for sustainable materials might be higher, the long-term benefits and company values geared towards sustainability play a crucial role in such decisions. Pela Case, for example, prioritizes environmental impact, which aligns with their brand identity and customer base, even if the immediate costs are higher."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Why is sustainable resource management important to you? Is there a specific issue or\nsectoral focus that you would like to apply this learning to? What are the underlying values and perspectives on resource use and\ncommunity vs. individualism that undergird the theories of Hardin\u2019s \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 vs. Ostrom\u2019s \u2018community governance\u2019?\nWhat assumptions did Hardin make and explain why you agree or disagree? What are the different systems \u2018controls\u2019 (i.e., regulation,\npolicy, community engagement) used in each of these types of ideology?\n\nHello everyone! It\u2019s nice to see some new faces in this course and hello to those of you whom I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting in past courses. My name is Priscilla. I am a small business owner in California, and it is my hope to become a future sustainability leader for my community through the CLU program. As someone who is eager to improve our world for future generations, it is my goal to take the knowledge gained and apply it to my future endeavors. I feel it is important for businesses in both the public and private sectors to utilize renewable energy when possible. Although the ability to store renewable energy is not where it needs to be, it is my hope to help influence others on how to utilize energy responsibly and to reduce dependency on fossil fuel energy.\n\nAdditionally, I aim to help others understand the need to utilize common resources responsibly so everyone in the community has equal opportunity. If resources are not utilized responsibly, access becomes limited and eventually depleted so setting guidelines is necessary to guarantee access for all. As we saw during the quarantine of 2020, some groups exploited resources out of fear of not having enough for themselves. Optimizing for the self isn\u2019t optimal for anyone in the long term. This meant some were not allowed the same resources due to resource depletion. Ostrom\u2019s \u2018community governance\u2019 outlines how proper resource usage is possible through a set of guidelines. Clearly defined boundaries, proportional equivalence, participation, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution, recognition of rights, and nested enterprises are the basic principles set by Ostrom in order to bring stability and protect the environment (Bisht, V., 2021). In the case of Hardin\u2019s \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019, the human population utilizes social contracts, we make communal agreements, we elect governments, and pass laws (Amendolare, N., 2018). We do this as a way to protect us from our collective selves and what is good for all of us is also good for each of us.\n\nHardin explains how guidelines need to be set up as a means to keep resources readily available for all because if left to our own devices, it is evident that resources will run out. Unfortunately, I do agree with him because we have seen this happen multiple times throughout history. Many animal species have gone extinct due to the exploitation of human expansion. One animal from our past is the Wooly mammoth. Some scientists attribute their extinction to overhunting and climate change which is something many animal species are currently experiencing. A modern example of this are the lemurs of Madagascar. The political crisis of the island country has created a wave of violent unrest and environmental crime. Poaching lemurs serves as a food source for the impoverished population and as a means to financial gains (Breyer, M., 2022). This is why we need to be mindful of our actions and interactions with the natural world. It is a give and take dynamic and the human species has been known to do own fair share of taking. When comparing the theories of Hardin and Ostrom, I see similarities, but they are best applied in different situations. Ostrom\u2019s controls seem best suited for smaller settings like local governments or villages. Whereas Hardin\u2019s controls seem best suited in larger settings like national and global settings.\n\nPart 2: Choose a real-world example in industry, manufacturing, or in a specific sector (i.e., agricultural company producing palm oil or foreign labor conditions for a U.S. brand of clothing) and research their sustainability measures, transparency, and supply chain\nmanagement. Do they have a sustainability or ethical production rating? Where could they improve their production or manufacturing?\nMake an argument for or against implementing additional sustainability measures. Would the benefits to the environment or to people\noutweigh the burden of implementing these measures? How would they be enforced? Describe briefly, the complexity or cost that may\nbe involved in the systems change necessary to bring the company or sector into sustainability.\n\n\u201cEVs are only as green as the power grid they draw from.\u201d\n-The Guardian (2022)\n\nIt is predicted by the year 2030, there will be roughly 145 million electric vehicles on the road. With zero carbon emissions, it is easy to see why they are a better choice over their fossil fuel counterparts. However, there are other aspects to EVs that are unknown to many. There are humanitarian and environmental impacts that must be considered during the manufacturing process. During this process, 60% more carbon is emitted than that of traditional fossil fuel vehicles. This is due to the mining process for the materials needed for batteries of EVs and the transport of these materials. Child labor is also an issue in some areas where cobalt is mined which has been addressed by some EV manufactures. On a sustainability level, EVs are a wonderful option but the power grid they draw power from also needs to be powered by near zero emissions sources like hydroelectric sources in order for them to be truly net zero emitters. Some countries utilize coal-fired power stations and EVs that are charged from these sources contribute nearly the same amount of carbon emissions as regular fossil fuel vehicles. Instead of enforcing the usage of EVs, we should focus on creating a more environmentally friendly public transportation options and reducing our dependency on personal transportation. While this is more doable in densely compacted settings like New York City, spread out suburban settings would be more difficult when cityscapes are much more spread out making public transportation less convenient for some. There are options for electric buses which shows it is possible, but it is at the will of the local governments to implement this option for transportation. For now, there are sustainable options we can utilize like walking or cycling when possible or sharing rides with others when traveling to the same destination (The Guardian, 2022). Not only is this healthier for the environment, this also can create a healthier lifestyle for some willing to try this option which is an added bonus.\n\nCan you write me a 1-2 paragraph response to this discussion post  that discusses the tru eco-footprint of EV&#x27;s considering that most electricity is produced using no renewable energy sources?

The true environmental impact of EVs extends beyond their operation and into their production and the sources of their electricity. As noted, the manufacturing process of EVs, particularly the batteries, requires significant amounts of energy and resources, often leading to higher initial carbon emissions compared to traditional vehicles. This issue is compounded by the fact that much of the world&#x27;s electricity is still generated from non-renewable sources such as coal and natural gas. \n\nAdditionally, the extraction of materials like lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements necessary for EV batteries often involves environmentally damaging practices and raises ethical concerns, including labor violations. While EVs present a promising shift towards reducing vehicular emissions, their overall sustainability is tightly linked to the decarbonization of the electrical grid and improvements in battery technology and recycling practices. For EVs to be a truly green option, the energy they consume needs to come from renewable sources, which is currently not the case in many regions.\n\nPriscilla, considering these factors, how do you see the role of policy and innovation in aligning the production and use of EVs with broader environmental goals?

After an introduction to the problem of overcoming social dilemmas\n\nthrough collective ac t io ,th e  remainder of this article is divided into six sections. The first briefly reviews the\ntheoretical predictions of curently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second\nsection summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by\nextensive erperimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to\nshow how individuals achieve results that are &quot;better than rational&quot; by building conditions where reciprocity,\nreputation  and trust can help to overcome the stong temptations of short-nun self-interest. The fourth\nsection raises the possibiliry of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops\nan  initial theoretical sc ea rio , and the  final section concludes by examining the implications o f  placing\nreciprocity reputation  and  trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.\n\nwe are hand-waving at  our central questions. I am\nafraid that  we do a lot of hand-waving.\n\net me start with a provocative statement. You\nwould not be reading this article if it were not for\nsome of our ancestors learning how to undertake\n\ncollective action to solve social dilem mas. Successive\ngenerations have added to the stock of everyday knowl-\nedge about how to instill productive norms of behavior\nin their children and to craft rules to support collective\naction that produces public goods and avoids &quot;trage-\ndies of the commons.&quot;I What our ancestors and con-\ntemporaries have learned about engaging in collective\naction for mutual defense,child rearing,and survival is\nnot , however, understood or explained by the extant\ntheory of collective action.\n\nThe lessons of effective collective action are not\nsimple\u2014as is obvious from human history and the\nimmense tragedies that humans have endured ,as  well\nas the successes we have realized. As global relation-\nships become even more intricately intertwined and\ncomplex,however, our survival becomes more depen-\ndent on empirically grounded scientific understanding.\nWe have not yet developed a behavioral theory of\ncollective action based on models of the individual\nconsistent with empirical evidence about how individ-\nuals make decisions in social-dilemma situations. A\nbehavioralcommitment to theory grounded in empir-\nical inquiry is essential if we are to understand such\nbasic questions as why face-to-face communication so\nconsistently enhances cooperation in social dilemmas\nor how structural variables facilitate or impede cffec-\ntive collective action.\n\nSocial dilemmas occur whenever individuals in inter-\ndependent situations face choices in which the maxi-\nmization of short-term self-interest yields outcomes\nleaving all participants worse off than feasible alterna-\ntives. In a public-good dilemma, for example, all those\nwho would benefit from the provision of a public\ngood\u2014such as pollution control, radio broadcasts  or\nweather forecasting\u2014find it costly to contribute and\nwould prefer others to pay for the good instead. If\neveryone follows the equilibrium strategy, then the\ngood is not provided or  is underprovided  Yet, every-\none would be better off if everyone were to contribute.\n\nSocial dilemmas are found in all aspects of life,\nleading to momentous decisions affecting war and\npeace as well as the mundane relationships of keeping\npromises in everyday life.Social dilemmas are called by\nmany names, including the public-good or collective-\ngood problem(Olson 1965, P.  Samuelson 1954),shirk-\ning(Alchian and Demsetz 1972), the free-rider prob-\nlem(Edney 1979,Grossman and Hart 1980),moral\nhazard(Holmstrom 1982),the credible commitment\ndilemma(Williams, Collins, and Lichbach 1997), gen-\neralized social exchange (Ekch 1974; Emerson 1972a,\n\nYet, the theory of collective action is the central\nsubject of political science  It is the core of the justifi-\ncation for the state.

But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).

I am\nafraid that  we do a lot of hand-waving.\n\net me start with a provocative statement. You\nwould not be reading this article if it were not for\nsome of our ancestors learning how to undertake\n\ncollective action to solve social dilem mas. Successive\ngenerations have added to the stock of everyday knowl-\nedge about how to instill productive norms of behavior\nin their children and to craft rules to support collective\naction that produces public goods and avoids &quot;trage-\ndies of the commons.&quot;I What our ancestors and con-\ntemporaries have learned about engaging in collective\naction for mutual defense,child rearing,and survival is\nnot , however, understood or explained by the extant\ntheory of collective action.\n\nThe lessons of effective collective action are not\nsimple\u2014as is obvious from human history and the\nimmense tragedies that humans have endured ,as  well\nas the successes we have realized. As global relation-\nships become even more intricately intertwined and\ncomplex,however, our survival becomes more depen-\ndent on empirically grounded scientific understanding.\nWe have not yet developed a behavioral theory of\ncollective action based on models of the individual\nconsistent with empirical evidence about how individ-\nuals make decisions in social-dilemma situations. A\nbehavioralcommitment to theory grounded in empir-\nical inquiry is essential if we are to understand such\nbasic questions as why face-to-face communication so\nconsistently enhances cooperation in social dilemmas\nor how structural variables facilitate or impede cffec-\ntive collective action.\n\nSocial dilemmas occur whenever individuals in inter-\ndependent situations face choices in which the maxi-\nmization of short-term self-interest yields outcomes\nleaving all participants worse off than feasible alterna-\ntives. In a public-good dilemma, for example, all those\nwho would benefit from the provision of a public\ngood\u2014such as pollution control, radio broadcasts  or\nweather forecasting\u2014find it costly to contribute and\nwould prefer others to pay for the good instead. If\neveryone follows the equilibrium strategy, then the\ngood is not provided or  is underprovided  Yet, every-\none would be better off if everyone were to contribute.\n\nSocial dilemmas are found in all aspects of life,\nleading to momentous decisions affecting war and\npeace as well as the mundane relationships of keeping\npromises in everyday life.Social dilemmas are called by\nmany names, including the public-good or collective-\ngood problem(Olson 1965, P.  Samuelson 1954),shirk-\ning(Alchian and Demsetz 1972), the free-rider prob-\nlem(Edney 1979,Grossman and Hart 1980),moral\nhazard(Holmstrom 1982),the credible commitment\ndilemma(Williams, Collins, and Lichbach 1997), gen-\neralized social exchange (Ekch 1974; Emerson 1972a,\n\nYet, the theory of collective action is the central\nsubject of political science  It is the core of the justifi-\ncation for the state.

But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).

Let&#x27;s reframe and expand the initial analysis in an academic context, incorporating insights and concepts from the provided materials.\n\n### Introduction\nSustainability in olive oil production is crucial not only for environmental conservation but also for maintaining the socioeconomic stability of rural communities. Azienda Agricola Vittorio Cassini, a producer of olive oil, serves as an illustrative case of how traditional agricultural practices are interfacing with modern sustainability demands.\n\n### Sustainability and Ethical Rating\nWhile Azienda has not explicitly pursued a Standard Ethics Rating, such voluntary ratings are aligned with broader EU and global sustainability goals. These ratings provide benchmarks that could guide the company towards international best practices in sustainability and transparency.\n\n### Current Sustainability Practices and Areas for Improvement\n#### Energy Efficiency\nAzienda could further reduce its carbon footprint by implementing renewable energy sources such as solar panels, which align with broader EU targets for renewable energy usage. As Brett M. Frischmann discusses, embracing complexity and avoiding reductionist solutions is crucial in resource management, which includes energy use in agricultural practices\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\n#### Water Management\nConsidering the significant water needs for olive cultivation, Azienda could improve its water management strategies. Techniques such as efficient irrigation systems, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling could be explored further. These techniques not only conserve water but also mirror the community-based management strategies that Elinor Ostrom found effective in managing commons sustainably\u301010\u2020source\u3011.\n\n#### Biodiversity Conservation\nPromoting biodiversity within olive groves could enhance ecosystem resilience and productivity. This approach is supported by Anthony Patt&#x27;s argument against simplistic &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; frameworks, suggesting that complex, adaptive strategies are often necessary for effective resource management\u30109\u2020source\u3011.\n\n### Benefits vs. Burden\n#### Environmental and Social Benefits\nEnhancing sustainability practices would likely yield significant environmental benefits, such as reduced emissions and better soil health, and social benefits, including fair wages and improved local livelihoods.\n\n#### Costs and Complexity\nWhile the initial financial outlay for sustainability measures such as solar panels and water-efficient systems can be high, the long-term savings and benefits often offset these costs. The complexity of implementing these systems can be managed through phased approaches and potentially through subsidies or financial incentives from governmental or EU sources.\n\n### Enforcement and System Change\nCertification by third-party organizations (e.g., organic, Fair Trade) could enforce Azienda\u2019s sustainability claims and foster consumer trust. Regular supply chain audits would ensure compliance with sustainability standards. The complexity and costs of these initiatives are part of a broader investment in sustainability that could serve as a model for the industry.\n\n### Conclusion\nImplementing additional sustainability measures at Azienda Agricola Vittorio Cassini presents a compelling case for the benefits outweighing the burdens. The company&#x27;s commitment to traditional methods combined with modern sustainability practices can serve as a beacon for the olive oil industry, driving broader changes that benefit both the environment and the communities dependent on agriculture. This integration of new sustainability measures aligns with the broader movement towards more resilient and adaptive management of agricultural resources, as advocated by Ostrom and others\u301010\u2020source\u3011\u30109\u2020source\u3011."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).

But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).

But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).

But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.

But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

This interest led me to the Claremont Lincolns Organizational Leadership Master the holistic learning practices align well with my own thoughts, beliefs and phjilosophy towards living and working in community. I have always been particularly fascinated by the politics and interplay of personalities and egos that occur when an individual begins to influence a process towards a common goal or objective (Northouse, 2019). The mechanics of this influence process, especially in the context of sustainable resource management, sparks my interest and curiosity greatly. . \n Values and Perspectives on Resource Use\nGarrett Hardin&#x27;s &#x27;Tragedy of the Commons&#x27; posits that individuals acting independently and rationally according to each one&#x27;s self-interest behave contrary to the whole group&#x27;s long-term best interests by depleting a common resource. This theory is undergirded by the values of individualism and the assumption that resources are limited and must be protected from overuse by individual actors. Hardin&#x27;s approach often suggests regulatory or privatization solutions to manage resources.\nElinor Ostrom&#x27;s &#x27;Community Governance&#x27; counters the tragedy by showing how local communities can successfully manage resources without external controls or privatization, through collective action and self-governance. Her theory is grounded in values of community, mutual benefits, and adaptability, demonstrating that collective, context-specific solutions can sustainably manage resources.\nAssumptions in Hardin&#x27;s Theory\nHardin assumes that:\nRational Individuals: People act independently based on rational self-interest, leading inevitably to resource overuse.\nLimited Resources: Resources are finite and must be either regulated or privatized to prevent depletion.\nNecessity of External Intervention: External authorities or privatization are needed to manage resources sustainably.\nWhile I find Hardin&#x27;s view helpful in understanding certain dilemmas like pollution or overfishing, I also recognize its limitations in accounting for the complexities of human behavior and the potential for cooperative governance seen in Ostrom\u2019s work. Ostrom\u2019s approach, on the other hand, acknowledges the capabilities of communities to create rules and institutions that manage resources effectively without external enforcement. I respect both these theories and believe that a balanced discussion on them will enrich our understanding of sustainable resource management.\nSystems of Controls\nHardin\u2019s Solutions: Often involve top-down regulations or privatizing resources to align individual incentives with societal good.\nOstrom\u2019s Solutions: Focus on bottom-up, community-based management where rules are adapted to specific local conditions and resource systems, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87e14f5b5c07bb05-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "035b95b5-3ac8-431d-af56-8f7ca5286650", "children": ["47868233-2443-4e14-a517-dbb68d0f5bbc"]}, "47868233-2443-4e14-a517-dbb68d0f5bbc": {"id": "47868233-2443-4e14-a517-dbb68d0f5bbc", "message": {"id": "47868233-2443-4e14-a517-dbb68d0f5bbc", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714750437.032524, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The passage you provided does a good job of introducing the individual, their motivations for joining the program, and their interest in sustainable resource management. It also effectively outlines the fundamental differences and underpinning values of Hardin&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; and Ostrom&#x27;s &quot;Community Governance&quot; theories, as well as the assumptions of each and the types of controls they advocate. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how well it addresses each component of the prompt:\n\n1. **Introduction and Motivation**: Alexis introduces herself and explains her interest in the program and sustainable resource management. However, she could elaborate more specifically on what skills or knowledge she hopes to gain from the program.\n\n2. **Values and Perspectives on Resource Use**: The response clearly delineates the contrasting values between Hardin and Ostrom. It highlights individualism and communal approaches, effectively setting the stage for discussing their implications on resource management.\n\n3. **Hardin&#x27;s Assumptions**: The passage succinctly outlines Hardin\u2019s assumptions about rational self-interest and the necessity of external interventions like regulation or privatization. Alexis mentions her agreement with some of Hardin&#x27;s points but also acknowledges the theory&#x27;s limitations, which is a balanced approach.\n\n4. **Systems of Controls**: Both Hardin&#x27;s and Ostrom&#x27;s preferred systems of controls are explained, illustrating the difference between top-down regulatory approaches and bottom-up community-based approaches. This part of the response effectively contrasts the operational ideologies of both theorists.\n\n5. **Application of Learning**: This is one area where the response could improve. Alexis mentions her interest in the politics and personality interplay in resource management but does not specify a particular sector or issue where she aims to apply her learning. Clarifying this could strengthen her narrative and show a direct application of her anticipated learning.\n\n6. **Underlying Values and Community vs. Individualism**: The passage mentions the underpinning values of both theories but could delve deeper into how these values impact the theories&#x27; feasibility and effectiveness in different contexts. Discussing specific scenarios or case studies could enhance this section.\n\n7. **Agreement or Disagreement with Hardin**: Alexis does a good job of stating why she both agrees and disagrees with Hardin\u2019s assumptions, providing a nuanced view that recognizes the complexity of sustainable resource management.\n\nOverall, the passage adequately answers the prompt but could be enhanced by more explicitly stating the skills Alexis hopes to develop, detailing the specific applications of her learning, and providing examples to further illustrate the practical implications of Hardin\u2019s and Ostrom\u2019s theories in real-world scenarios."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The stage is set with three experts seated at a table with microphones: an environmental scientist (Dr. Green), an olive oil producer (Mr. Oliva), and a policy maker (Ms. Legis).\n\n---\n\n**Moderator**: Welcome everyone. Today, we&#x27;re diving into the sustainability of olive oil production in Italy. Let&#x27;s start with Dr. Green. Could you provide us with an overview of the current sustainability and ethical production ratings in this industry?\n\n**Dr. Green**: Certainly. The Italian olive oil sector has made strides in adopting sustainable practices, such as using organic farming methods and reducing pesticide use. However, the industry varies greatly in terms of ethical production standards. Water usage and the impact on biodiversity are ongoing concerns. There&#x27;s no standardized rating system across the board, which is something we could improve.\n\n**Moderator**: Interesting points. Mr. Oliva, as a producer, where do you see opportunities for improvement in your production processes?\n\n**Mr. Oliva**: We could definitely benefit from more consistent use of renewable energy sources in our operations. Solar energy, for instance, is underutilized. Additionally, improving waste management, like recycling olive pomace for bioenergy, could significantly enhance our sustainability.\n\n**Moderator**: Now, Ms. Legis, there&#x27;s often debate about whether the benefits of implementing stricter sustainability measures outweigh the costs. What&#x27;s your take?\n\n**Ms. Legis**: Absolutely, the benefits do outweigh the costs. By implementing sustainable practices, we not only protect our environment but also boost the long-term viability of the olive oil industry. These measures can increase consumer trust and open up new markets that value ethical production.\n\n**Moderator**: Dr. Green, how could these measures be enforced?\n\n**Dr. Green**: Enforcement would require clear regulations and a transparent certification process. This could involve regular audits and perhaps even incentives for producers to adopt greener methods. It\u2019s about creating a framework that supports sustainability at every step.\n\n**Moderator**: Mr. Oliva, could you describe the complexity or cost involved in making these changes?\n\n**Mr. Oliva**: Transitioning can be costly upfront. For example, installing solar panels or new water-efficient systems requires significant investment. However, these costs are offset by long-term savings in energy and water bills. Training staff and altering supply chains also add to the initial expense but are crucial for sustainable development.\n\n**Moderator**: And finally, Ms. Legis, how would you argue for the implementation of these sustainability measures?\n\n**Ms. Legis**: It&#x27;s not just about the environment or ethical production; it&#x27;s about future-proofing an entire industry. Italy&#x27;s reputation for quality olive oil can be enhanced with a strong commitment to sustainability, appealing to a global market that increasingly values these practices. The government should support this transition through subsidies and tax incentives to ease the financial burden on producers.\n\n**Moderator**: Thank you all for your insightful contributions. It&#x27;s clear that while challenges exist, the path to sustainability in the Italian olive oil industry is not only necessary but also beneficial for all stakeholders involved.\n\n---\n\n**End Scene**"]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

While some producers have adopted organic and sustainable practices, there is still considerable variability across the industry. Key areas for improvement include reducing water usage, minimizing the use of pesticides, and ensuring fair labor practices. These changes are essential not only for environmental health but also for preserving the industry&#x27;s longevity and reputation globally.\n\nImplementing additional sustainability measures, however, involves a complex balance of benefits against potential burdens. On one hand, adopting more sustainable practices could lead to improved soil health, reduced environmental footprint, and enhanced market positioning for Italian olive oil as a product of ethical production. On the other hand, the transition requires significant investment in new technologies and systems, as well as training for farmers to adapt to new sustainable methods. The costs and complexities associated with these changes pose a significant challenge for many producers, especially smaller operations.\n\nThe enforcement of these sustainability measures would likely require a robust framework of certification and regulation. While the initial costs and effort to shift toward complete sustainability are considerable, the long-term environmental and social benefits could outweigh these challenges. It is crucial to consider how these measures can be effectively enforced and supported by both national policies and international cooperation to ensure a successful transition for the industry.

This theory is undergirded by the values of individualism and the assumption that resources are limited and must be protected from overuse by individual actors.

Her theory is grounded in values of community, mutual benefits, and adaptability, demonstrating that collective, context-specific solutions can sustainably manage resources.\n\nAssumptions in Hardin&#x27;s Theory\nHardin assumes that:\n\nRational Individuals: People act independently based on rational self-interest, leading inevitably to resource overuse.\nLimited Resources: Resources are finite and must be either regulated or privatized to prevent depletion.\nNecessity of External Intervention: External authorities or privatization are needed to manage resources sustainably.\nI would argue that while Hardin&#x27;s view helps understand certain dilemmas like pollution or overfishing, it does not account for the complexities of human behavior and the potential for cooperative governance seen in Ostrom\u2019s work. Ostrom\u2019s approach acknowledges the capabilities of communities to create rules and institutions that manage resources effectively without external enforcement.\n\nSystems of Controls\nHardin\u2019s Solutions: Often involve top-down regulations or privatizing resources to align individual incentives with societal good.\n\nOstrom\u2019s Solutions: Focus on bottom-up, community-based management where rules are adapted to specific local conditions and resource systems, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87e0e17919210d68-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "fca1abca-6601-4197-90b1-ecd22173a83a", "children": ["0a3a215b-16b8-4bb6-8981-d36237eb3594"]}, "0a3a215b-16b8-4bb6-8981-d36237eb3594": {"id": "0a3a215b-16b8-4bb6-8981-d36237eb3594", "message": {"id": "0a3a215b-16b8-4bb6-8981-d36237eb3594", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714745917.597323, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Thank you for sharing such an interesting topic on resource use theories by Garrett Hardin and Elinor Ostrom.

The industry faces sustainability and ethical production challenges that are closely tied to environmental and social factors.\n\nSustainability Measures and Transparency\nItalian olive oil producers often adopt sustainable practices such as organic farming, which avoids the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, reducing environmental impact and promoting biodiversity. Some producers also use modern irrigation systems that conserve water, a critical resource in Mediterranean agriculture.\n\nEthical Production Ratings\nItaly, being part of the European Union, adheres to stringent EU regulations that cover environmental protection, labor rights, and food safety. These regulations ensure a high standard of ethical production. Additionally, certifications like the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) not only assure quality and region-specific characteristics but also promote ethical production practices by maintaining traditional methods that are often more sustainable.\n\nPotential Improvements\nWhile many Italian olive oil producers are moving towards sustainability, there is room for improvement, especially in reducing the carbon footprint associated with packaging and distribution. Producers could also enhance transparency in their supply chains, providing consumers with detailed information about the sourcing of olives and the production processes.\n\nArgument for Additional Sustainability Measures\nImplementing further sustainability measures in the Italian olive oil industry could lead to significant environmental benefits, such as greater soil health and reduced water use. Social benefits include sustaining rural communities and preserving traditional agricultural practices that are a part of Italy\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nEnforcement\nSustainability measures can be enforced through national regulations that align with EU policies, coupled with incentives for farmers to adopt sustainable practices. Industry associations like Assitol could play a critical role in promoting these practices through education and certification programs.\n\nComplexity and Cost\nAdopting advanced sustainable technologies and practices might involve high initial costs, but these can be offset by long-term gains such as increased efficiency, improved product quality, and access to markets that value sustainability. Costs might also be mitigated by government subsidies and EU funding aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture.\n\nSystem Change Challenges\nTransitioning to more sustainable production involves overcoming challenges like the small scale of many olive farms, which can make it difficult to invest in new technologies. However, cooperative models and shared resources among small producers can facilitate this transition.\n\nConclusion\nThe Italian olive oil industry&#x27;s move towards increased sustainability and ethical production is not only feasible but beneficial both environmentally and socially.

The industry faces sustainability and ethical production challenges that are closely tied to environmental and social factors.\n\nSustainability Measures and Transparency\nItalian olive oil producers often adopt sustainable practices such as organic farming, which avoids the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, reducing environmental impact and promoting biodiversity. Some producers also use modern irrigation systems that conserve water, a critical resource in Mediterranean agriculture.\n\nEthical Production Ratings\nItaly, being part of the European Union, adheres to stringent EU regulations that cover environmental protection, labor rights, and food safety. These regulations ensure a high standard of ethical production. Additionally, certifications like the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) not only assure quality and region-specific characteristics but also promote ethical production practices by maintaining traditional methods that are often more sustainable.\n\nPotential Improvements\nWhile many Italian olive oil producers are moving towards sustainability, there is room for improvement, especially in reducing the carbon footprint associated with packaging and distribution. Producers could also enhance transparency in their supply chains, providing consumers with detailed information about the sourcing of olives and the production processes.\n\nArgument for Additional Sustainability Measures\nImplementing further sustainability measures in the Italian olive oil industry could lead to significant environmental benefits, such as greater soil health and reduced water use. Social benefits include sustaining rural communities and preserving traditional agricultural practices that are a part of Italy\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\nEnforcement\nSustainability measures can be enforced through national regulations that align with EU policies, coupled with incentives for farmers to adopt sustainable practices. Industry associations like Assitol could play a critical role in promoting these practices through education and certification programs.\n\nComplexity and Cost\nAdopting advanced sustainable technologies and practices might involve high initial costs, but these can be offset by long-term gains such as increased efficiency, improved product quality, and access to markets that value sustainability. Costs might also be mitigated by government subsidies and EU funding aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture.\n\nSystem Change Challenges\nTransitioning to more sustainable production involves overcoming challenges like the small scale of many olive farms, which can make it difficult to invest in new technologies. However, cooperative models and shared resources among small producers can facilitate this transition.\n\nConclusion\nThe Italian olive oil industry&#x27;s move towards increased sustainability and ethical production is not only feasible but beneficial both environmentally and socially. While challenges exist, particularly in terms of cost and complexity, the long-term benefits of such initiatives significantly outweigh these difficulties. The application of Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s community governance approach could be particularly effective here, leveraging local knowledge and collective action to manage resources sustainably while preserving the cultural heritage of Italian olive oil production.\nthat answers these questions;\n Choose a real-world example in industry, manufacturing, or in a specific sector (i.e., agricultural company producing palm oil or foreign labor conditions for a U.S. brand of clothing) and research their sustainability measures, transparency, and supply chain management. Do they have a sustainability or ethical production rating? Where could they improve their production or manufacturing? Make an argument for or against implementing additional sustainability measures. Would the benefits to the environment or to people outweigh the burden of implementing these measures? How would they be enforced? Describe briefly, the complexity or cost that may be involved in the systems change necessary to bring the company or sector into sustainability.\n\nAnd follows this outline more or less : \n\nIntroduction\nBrief overview of the Italian olive oil industry and its significance.\nIntroduction to sustainability and ethical production issues.\nSustainability Measures and Ethical Production\nHighlighting organic farming, modern irrigation systems, and the role of PDO and PGI certifications.\nChallenges and Areas for Improvement\nDiscussion on the carbon footprint, need for transparency, and supply chain management.\nArguments for Additional Sustainability Measures\nEnvironmental and social benefits of proposed sustainability measures.\nEnforcement mechanisms and the role of industry associations.\nEconomic and System Change Considerations\nCost implications and potential long-term economic benefits.\nChallenges for small-scale farms and solutions.\nConclusion\nSummarizing the benefits and advocating for increased sustainability measures."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87dec469bf4ebb2b-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "449aa507-cb74-4161-b97f-d5ea28ecff0c", "children": ["1cfee6dc-f08f-4c8f-a159-998257aa0e18"]}, "1cfee6dc-f08f-4c8f-a159-998257aa0e18": {"id": "1cfee6dc-f08f-4c8f-a159-998257aa0e18", "message": {"id": "1cfee6dc-f08f-4c8f-a159-998257aa0e18", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714723759.69584, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["Hello!

To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

His legacy is far more than a single organization.\n\nDedication\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page v\n\n\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page vi\n\n\n\nPreface to the Second Edition x\n\nIntroduction to the Second Edition xvii\n\nChapter 1 Values: The Context for Philanthropy, Development, and Fundraising 1\nPhilanthropy Def ined 1\nThe Role of Values in the Nonprof it Sector 2\nDeveloping a Values-Based Approach 3\nA Model of Values-Based Philanthropy, Development, and Fundraising 5\nUnderstanding the Model 5\nA Paradigm Shift: Integrating Philanthropy, Development, and Fundraising 14\nSummary 15\n\nChapter 2 Putting Away the Tin Cup: Changed Attitude, Changed Practices 17\nWhy the Tin Cup Attitude Persists:Asker, Funder, and Institutional Reasons 17\nWhy Individuals and Institutions Must Change 24\nA New View of Funders: Donor-Investors 24\nThe Investor Relationship 25\nConveying a New Attitude:Whose Needs Are You Presenting? 28\nSummary 30\n\nChapter 3 Preventing Mission Drift: The Leadership Imperative 31\nMaintaining a Strong Organization and a Strong Mission 31\nDef ining Mission Drift 31\nAvoiding Mission Drift 32\nPractices of Able Nonprof it Leaders 33\nSpecial Challenges to Nonprof it Leaders: Balancing the Demands \nof Mission Fulf illment and Organizational Requirements 35\nThe Role of Leaders in Maintaining Ef fective Systems 39\nLeadership in Times of Change 40\nSummary 44\n\nContents\n\nvii\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page vii\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Successful Development: Partnership and Process 47\nPartnerships for Development and Fundraising 47\nCreating Development Partnerships 48\nStructuring a Successful Development Partnership 50\nThe Development Process:A Partnership for Donor and \nResource Development 55\nSummary 75\n\nChapter 5 Inviting Investment 77\nDef ining Donor-Investor 78\nBuilding a Base of Donor-Investors 78\nChallenges to Implementing an Investment Attitude 79\nAsking for Investment 79\nInviting Investment:The Solicitation Steps 80\nShedding Old Attitudes 90\nOvercoming Objections 97\nIncreasing Organizational Involvement in the Invitation to Invest 99\nWe Have Learned to Love the New Approach 100\nSummary 101\n\nChapter 6 Capitalizing on the Community\u2019s Investment\nPart One: Annual Campaigns 103\nAnnual and Capital Campaigns 103\nAnnual Campaigns 105\nAnnual Campaigns: Development as Well as Fundraising 105\nPresenting Multiple Gift Opportunities to Donors 120\nElements of a Successful Annual Campaign 121\nSummary 126\n\nChapter 7 Capitalizing on the Community\u2019s Investment\nPart Two: Capital Campaigns 127\nRationale for Capital Campaigns 128\nNeed to Capitalize Nonprof its 129\nAttracting Donors to Capital Campaigns 129\nWhat to Consider Before Undertaking a Capital Campaign 134\nDetermining Whether to Go Ahead with a Campaign 135\nSummary 140\n\nChapter 8 Stewardship: The Heart of the Development Process 141\nWhy Practice Stewardship? 141\nWhat Stewardship Means 142\nGiving and Stewardship 143\nStewardship and Belonging 143\nGetting Donors and Prospects into the Kitchen 144\nPutting Priority on Stewardship 145\nPrinciples for Creating a Stewardship Program 145\n\nviii contents\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page viii\n\n\n\nImplementing a Stewardship Program 150\nCreating a Culture of Philanthropy through Stewardship 155\nTwenty-f irst-Century Tools for Stewardship 155\nSummary 156\n\nChapter 9 Maximizing Board Development and Participation 159\nBoard Development:The Key to Fund Development 159\nReplace Your Nominating Committee with a Committee on Trustees or \nBoard Development Committee 160\nRecruitment 162\nEnlistment 168\nBoard Retention and Involvement 172\nBoard or Bored?

I remember receiving calls from perplexed colleagues\nacross America who questioned my use of the word \u201cinvestment\u201d in the subtitle\u2014par-\nticularly in the same breath with my rhapsodic approach to philanthropy. Then, and\nnow, I see no contradiction. And, over the last eight years, the idea of \u201cinvestment\u201d has\nbeen the take-f ire trend in philanthropy. Social investment is understood, sought, and\nwelcomed. Volunteer \u201ctool kits\u201d for campaigns list \u201cinvestment opportunities.\u201dThe idea\nis no longer dissonant with the values premise of giving. Indeed, we have seen how the\ninvestment approach to community building through philanthropy has been the for-\nmula for increasing success.\n\nThe other principle I advanced in 1997 was the need for innovation. I stand today\neven more f irmly behind that notion. Where I see success both in the United States and\nabroad, it is because of innovation and creativity. Where I see failure, it is from the\nopposite behavior: unwillingness to change, the creation of internal and external silos\nwithin organizations and the sector, the resistance to taking the best ideas from the busi-\nness sector and applying them to our organizations.The absence of shared vision in com-\nmunities and organizations continues to inhibit the realization of our sector\u2019s power.\n\nWe are in many ways the most powerful sector. Not the largest, but the most power-\nful. Rooted in community trust and meeting clear and pressing needs, we make a pro-\nfound dif ference and, in the words of Robert Payton,\u201cease human suffering and enhance\nhuman potential\u201d as no other community resources can. Our universities, schools, hospi-\ntals, arts and cultural centers, human and social services organizations, environmental\nservices and other organizations help determine the quality of society and life and\nadvance the ideas of personal and community fulf illment. Unhampered (we hope!) by\ngovernment\u2019s layered bureaucracy and freed from the pressure of purely bottom line\naccountability of corporations, we can be nimble as we assess, respond, reach out, accom-\nplish, evaluate, grow, and have an ever-expanding impact.\n\nPreface to the Second Edition\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page x\n\n\n\nRevising Beyond Fundraising has given me the gift of time to step back and ref lect on\nour sector today, at the beginning of the twenty-f irst century. I remain bullish. Recent\neconomic twists and turns and global events caused some small setbacks in fundraising\nbut strengthened our sense of mission. And that, after all, is what we are about.\n\nBeyond Fundraising: What It Means\n\nBecause this book is written for volunteers and staf f people working in a sector that is\nbased on the measurable success of its fundraising, the title may seem odd.The principle\nis simple: To go beyond fundraising, organizations must do more than fund raise. They\nmust also:\n\n\u2022 Believe and practice the principle that development is a comprehensive process of\nwhich fundraising is a pivotal part.\n\n\u2022 Understand that development is the series of deliberate activities by which we\ninvolve and retain funders in a donor-investor relationship with our organizations.\n\n\u2022 Give up the idea that \u201cdevelopment\u201d is synonymous with fundraising, the series of\napproaches to prospects and donors (direct mail, phone appeals, fundraising events,\nfall campaigns, winter campaigns) that yield revenues and donors from year to year.\nDevelopment is much bigger than fundraising. And fundraising alone is not enough.\n\nThe Need Continues to Grow\n\nThe need for the nonprof it sector to go \u201cbeyond fundraising\u201d and to understand and\napply development principles continues to grow. Increased competition among funders\nand a higher level of sophistication among donors have changed the nature of philan-\nthropy, development, and fundraising.\n\nOnce viewed as needy institutions to which people gave out of a sense of obligation,\nnonprof its now f ind they are being evaluated against dif ferent and tougher criteria\nbased on their own f inancial and community performance and their capacity to meet\ndonor needs. This shift in expectations requires organizations to practice the longer\nterm process of development; to go beyond fundraising.\n\nThe Origin of Beyond Fundraising and \nthe Basis for Its Revision\n\nAlthough I have written several other books since Beyond Fundraising was f irst published,\nthis book embodies my core beliefs and has been a continuous writing project for nearly\na decade. Many of its principles and strategies formed the basis of my f irst workshop\nwhen I began my consulting career. \u201cPutting Away the Tin Cup\u201d was, starting in 1987,\nmy \u201csignature seminar\u201d and was given for more than a decade to boards of trustees, other\nvolunteers, and staf f members of hundreds of not-for-prof it organizations in the United\nStates, Canada,Australia, the United Kingdom, and western Europe.\n\npreface xi\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xi\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of \u201cPutting Away the Tin Cup\u201d workshops was to raise the\ncomfort level of board and staf f members as they raised money for nonprof it organiza-\ntions. It challenged old notions about fundraising. The workshop introduced new con-\ncepts and new ideas that allowed organizations to position themselves more positively in\ntheir communities. These same ideas have also guided my consultation with scores of\norganizations, have grown out of and informed my more than 20 years of teaching with\nThe Fund Raising School and other organizations, and they are the basis of this book.\nImportantly, I was a good listener at those sessions. I heard what volunteers and profes-\nsionals were saying about the obstacles and challenges they faced, and I was heartened by\ntheir successes. I still am. And in my own volunteer work with Stanford University and\nserving on boards of other organizations, I saw things from the perspective of the busy\nvolunteer who wants time, tools, and training and to be a partner for change.\n\nOver the years, my insights have sharpened to ref lect the experience and needs of the\nthousands of volunteer and staf f leaders with whom I have worked. These leaders have\nrepresented many places and institutions: public television across America, a national\ndomestic violence policy and education organization headquartered in San Francisco, a\nuniversity in England, a library in Paris, a leukemia foundation in Australia, a land trust\nin California, a technical institute in New Zealand, a preparatory school in Seattle, a\nmedical center near Los Angeles, a children\u2019s hospital in Canada, a church organization\nin Sweden, opera companies in New York and San Francisco, orchestras from across\nAmerica, and museums in New Mexico, Colorado, and France. Although these organi-\nzations dif fer, and the volunteer and staf f roles vary, the concerns expressed by clients\nand workshop attendees have many common threads:\n\n\u2022 Fear of rejection and a reluctance to be viewed as beggars as their principal reasons\nfor feeling uncomfortable with fundraising \n\n\u2022 Worry about asking too often, and wanting strategies for asking more ef fectively \n\n\u2022 Weariness of the relentless cycle of fundraising activities that they must pursue to\ngenerate revenues for their programs, and wanting to know how to cultivate and\nretain donors by building relationships with them\n\n\u2022 Enthusiasm about their organizations and their own capacity to make a dif ference\nin their communities \n\n\u2022 An eagerness to learn how to position their organizations in their communities as\nthe constructive, vital, and important organizations they are \n\nPrincipal Concepts\n\nThe principal concepts in this book are the \u201caha\u201d ideas that have been formed from\nthese common needs and tested in these workshops and consultations. To go beyond\nfundraising, nonprof its need to:\n\n\u2022 Position themselves as organizations that meet needs, not as organizations that have\nneeds\n\nxii preface\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xii\n\n\n\n\u2022 Know that a gift to them is really a gift through them into the community\n\n\u2022 Focus on program results, not just on f inancial goals\n\n\u2022 Remember that the process of asking and giving is based in shared values \n\n\u2022 View our organizations, and encourage others to perceive them, as vital additions\nto communities whose services and enhancements must be balanced and strong\n\n\u2022 Engage nonprof it leaders and donors at all levels in a process that will convert them\nto donor-investors, committed to a long-term relationship based on shared values\nand vision\n\n\u2022 Position all contributions to nonprof it organizations as social investments and all\ncontributors as donor-investors\n\n\u2022 See the process of revenue generation and constituency involvement as a much\nlarger, inclusive, and energizing process called development.\n\nThe Breakthrough Innovation\n\nOrganizations try new fundraising tactics but do not see they still lack the development\nframework that will create a lasting base of donor-investors. They seek innovative strate-\ngies for increasing revenues: the event no one has tried, the cleverly (or emotionally)\ncrafted mailing that will survive the 15-second initial exposure test and result in a f irst-\ntime gift, or hiring the best possible \u201cfundraiser\u201d (as they persist in inappropriately\ncalling development professionals). None of these strategies is enough to bring a consis-\ntent and stable base of funding to an organization without the principal innovation that\ngoes beyond fundraising and inspires development.\n\nThe innovation that has the most singular impact on all organizations with which I\nhave worked during my years as a consultant and teacher to the philanthropic sector is\nthis: an innovation in attitude about the entire fundraising process, one that properly puts\nit into the larger context of development and philanthropy. Only then does true innova-\ntion occur. Attitudes shift. One person wrote, after a particularly rigorous workshop,\u201cI\nwill now feel proud to ask for money for our college.\u201d\n\nInnovation requires a willingness to set aside old ideas. A certain entrepreneurial spirit\nmust prevail; there must be a willingness to risk. Courage is fundamental and conf idence\nis critical. The enviable mystique that surrounds those who are successful at fundraising\nis nothing more, in my experience, than the attitude those individuals have about the\nprocess:\n\n\u2022 They know it is hard work, but it is worth it.\n\n\u2022 They are passionate about the causes for which they are raising money.\n\n\u2022 They come not as beggars, but as individuals of fering others opportunities to invest\nin the future of their communities.\n\n\u2022 They are the catalyst for converting citizens to donor-investors in the organizations\nwhose values they share.\n\npreface xiii\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xiii\n\n\n\n\u2022 They f ind the process to be satisfying and gratifying.\n\n\u2022 They see it as a way of involving people known and unknown to them in organi-\nzations that are making a dif ference in their communities.\n\nFor those who have made the attitudinal breakthrough, an invitation to provide or ask\nfor funds for an organization is an invitation to invest or ask others to invest. Each act of\ngiving and asking is an honor, a privilege, and a trust. We can measure the impact of\ngifts by the results the organization achieves.\n\nI have watched as board members, other volunteers, staf f members, and the curious\nwho are not yet involved with philanthropy realize that asking for money is an invita-\ntion to invest. I have heard their stories of the transforming nature of both asking and\ngiving, and I have listened as they relate their increased stakeholder role. I have seen\nwhat happens to attitudes about fundraising when people realize that the investment\ngoes beyond the organization: that an investment made in a not-for-prof it organization\nis an investment in the community. And I have seen donors transformed through their\ninvestments and their sense of involvement and belonging.\n\nThese are powerful realizations.We have been helped in the last f ive or more years by\nan increased awareness in the media of our power and impact. No longer relegated to\npage 16 of local and national newspapers and magazines (or to the local or social sec-\ntion), news of philanthropic investments is front page. Magazines understand us now as\na vital social force. We can hope that the old days of disparaging and ignorant coverage\nof our sector are gone. When I ref lect on the way things were, I remember how one of\nthe high-circulation magazines wrote about major university capital campaigns that were\nunder way a decade ago. The article was titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Top Universities Go Begging\nin Style.\u201d I hope we have gone beyond that image. We do not come from weakness. We\nhave no need to beg. We come from the strength of our visible impact, convictions, and\nvalues. The perception of our sector is changing, and with it the demands for account-\nability and disclosure are rising. We are meeting those demands, but still have a distance\nto go. We need to promote ourselves more vigorously as the \u201cpublic benef it sector\u201d and\nas public benef it organizations\u2014leaving the label of \u201ccharity\u201d to the more appropriate\ndescription of the purpose for which we have been created and the reasons that people\ngive (charitable intent, charitable purpose). \u201cCharity\u201d connotes to far too many people\norganizations that are needy. We are not needy: we meet needs. Even \u201cnonprof it\u201d has its\ndrawbacks\u2014what other sector of the economy describes itself by what it is not? (Peter\nHero, CEO, Community Foundation Silicon Valley)\n\nAs we go ever more deliberately beyond fundraising into systemic development prac-\ntices that focus on the donor, the community, social investment, and innovation, we will\nensure that the new perception of our sector holds.\n\nA Book of Tested Ideas\n\nIn 1997, with the f irst edition, I drew on my experience for the observations, strategies,\nand tips in this book. As I reviewed them in 2005, the vast majority remained true.\n\nxiv preface\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xiv\n\n\n\nClients and audiences change, the marketplace has def initely changed, donors are vastly\ndif ferent, and yet the core principles set forth in this book have lasted. Perhaps it was\nahead of its time.\n\nMy passions about the not-for-prof it sector are many. These passions include ethics,\nvalues, creativity, innovation, professionalism, board participation, pride in the sector,\npartnerships at all levels of an organization and in the community, and a keen sense of\nmission and vision. My passions are characterized by an absence of cynicism and an abun-\ndance of enthusiasm. Recently a colleague asked me if I am always \u201cso optimistic.\u201d My\nanswer was yes. I remain optimistic about the power and potential of philanthropy and\nthe great gains we are making in America and around the globe.The late John W. Gardner,\nboth mentor and friend to me, instructed us that as leaders we must of fer hope.That has\nalways been my goal.\n\nA Book for Volunteers and Staff \nThroughout the World\n\nThis book is for both paid and unpaid leaders and servants of the not-for-prof it sector\nthroughout the world. Its principles are universal. Many philanthropic practices and\nstrategies, long a part of the American tradition, have been implemented with vision\nand success in countries throughout the world. Cross-cultural adaptations will of course\nbe made by those in other countries implementing American ideas\u2014even by our close\nneighbors and colleagues in Latin America and Canada\u2014but the kernel of each strategy\nis sound.\n\nAs my work has expanded globally in recent years, so has my perspective and under-\nstanding of both common and divergent practices.\n\nCertain ideas and issues have distilled with force and clarity. Although the primary\nfocus of the sector will always be on ways to generate more revenue, it is a growing reality\nthat fundraising is not enough. Experienced organizations know this is so. In practice,\nunfortunately, they too often ignore this crucial truth. They do not take the time to do\nthe kind of relationship building that is indispensable for long-term development. Even\nif they cultivate their prospects well\u2014building relationships as a prelude to asking for\nthe gift\u2014they often fail repeatedly at donor stewardship. In a recent survey done to\nassess factors that would lure lapsed members back to public television, one woman\nresponded:\u201cThey would have to show me that they know me.\u201d\n\nStewardship is not just diligent monitoring of the way in which a person\u2019s gift is\ninvested or used. Stewardship is the process of involving and appreciating donor-investors\nand bringing them into a deeper relationship with the organization after the gift is\nmade. Stewardship is the most critical development practice. It encourages long-term\ninvestment in our sector. The importance of stewardship threads its way through this\nbook, and there is an entire chapter dedicated to it as well.\n\nWith business and government unable, unwilling, or ill-equipped to do what we do,\nwe play an increasingly vital role. In a healthy society, nonprof its must provide both\n\npreface xv\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xv\n\n\n\ninitiative and response. We need only ref lect on the outpouring of sympathy and sup-\nport following the 9/11 terrorist attack in the United States and the Tsunami that dev-\nastated South Asian and African communities on the Indian Ocean in December, 2004,\nto see the capacity of people to care. Organizations quickly positioned themselves to\nmeet the desperate human needs of these communities and people responded.\n\nGoing forward into the twenty-f irst century, the philanthropic sector has an oppor-\ntunity to build stronger communities through boldness, innovation, and new models for\naction that are based on results, not needs; investment opportunities, not institutional\nf inancial urgency. As observer, counselor, teacher, constructive critic, and conf idante, I\nhave been privileged beyond expression to work with staf f and volunteer leaders who\nare truly making a dif ference in the health and stability of our society. This book is for\nyou, and for all those who wish to bring innovation and investment to their communities.\n\nKAY SPRINKEL GRACE\n\nMarch 2005\n\nxvi preface\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xvi\n\n\n\nxvii\n\nIntroduction to the Second Edition\n\nThe changes that have occurred in philanthropy since I began writing Beyond Fund-\nraising in 1995 and since it was published in 1997 are substantial. We have seen the Amer-\nican economic bubble swell and burst and begin to grow again.With the unprecedented\ngrowth in wealth came an extraordinary and generation-spanning awareness of the power\nof philanthropic investment.\n\nCover stories during 1999\u20132001 in Business Week, Forbes, Success, Fortune and com-\nprehensive articles in publications as far-reaching as The New York Times and The Econo-\nmist focused on the awakening of widespread interest in ways for individual social\ninvestors, through philanthropic gifts, to help meet the needs of their communities. The\n\u201cgolden age\u201d of philanthropy came upon us: Vast wealth was created, and the \u201cnew phi-\nlanthropists\u201d (whether in their 20s or their 70s) recognized the satisfying return of this\nnew kind of investment. But that satisfaction was based on new demands on the sector.\nAccountability and transparency became the requirement for philanthropic investment,\nand public benef it corporations (nonprof its) not only began providing more information\nbut began offering more opportunities for donor involvement in their organizations.\n\nAstride this fast-paced movement toward greater and deeper investment, which was\ninf luenced in tempo and leadership by young entrepreneurs impatient to change the\nworld, our sector rode a roller coaster. Eager for the investment, some organizations\nagreed to conditions that placed undue strain on their management and boards, and\noften led to disappointed investors. \u201cVenture philanthropy\u201d became a hotly debated\ntopic, and standards for performance by organizations in our sector were scrutinized.\n\nParallel with these changes in the United States, our active exportation of philan-\nthropy to far-f lung corners of the world f lourished. Many of our great social entrepre-\nneurs and investors\u2014Bill and Melinda Gates, George Soros\u2014saw with keen vision that\nglobalization was not just about economics. It was about our interconnectedness with\npeople and our common quest to improve education, eradicate poverty, and eliminate\nboth chronic and catastrophic diseases. Our greatest social export, philanthropy, found\nnew markets\u2014driven by new freedom in eastern Europe, a rising epidemic of AIDS in\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xvii\n\n\n\nxviii introduction\n\nAfrica, a persistent need for social services and change in western Europe and Asia, and\na growing recognition in all parts of the world that governments were never again going\nto fund community organizations at the level many countries had experienced in pre-\nvious centuries.\n\nAs social investors demanded more oversight of their investment and wanted more\ncontrol over their wealth while considering to what philanthropic purpose it would be\nput, another change occurred. Community foundations in the United States burgeoned,\nswelled by donor-advised funds and supporting organizations that provided investors\nwith advice from experienced philanthropic managers while of fering them the desired\ncontrol over their money and their investments. This movement, too, resonated with\nresourceful people outside the United States and the community foundation movement\ntook f ire.WINGS (Worldwide Initiatives for Grantmaker Support), in its May 2004 \u201c2004\nCommunity Foundation Global Status Report,\u201d highlighted these developments among\nothers:\n\n\u2022 42 countries have community foundations, up from 36 in 2003, and 8 more coun-\ntries are seriously considering forming foundations.\n\n\u2022 1,120 community foundations exist worldwide with another 142 in active formation.\n\n\u2022 37.5 percent of these exist outside the United States, up from 34 percent in 2003;\nCanada and the United States together represent 47 percent of the foundations,\ndown from 52 percent in 2003.\n\n\u2022 Between 1999 and 2004, the number of community foundations outside North\nAmerica grew by 176 percent.\n\n\u2022 The f irst ever global meeting of community foundation practitioners from around\nthe world gathered at the Community Foundation Symposium in Berlin in Decem-\nber 2004\u2014 a \u201crecognition of how far the global movement has progressed in just\nten years.\u201d\n\nThe truly remarkable aspect of all of this is that the core philanthropic interest, curiosity,\nand energy of the late twentieth and early twenty-f irst centuries persists in spite of the\nfact that we have, since September 11, 2001, been coming to grips with enormous\nchanges in our economy, our sense of personal safety, and the overall stability of the\nworld.The War on Terrorism will most likely be the long war that politicians and scholars\npredict, and no country is immune. From the United States to Indonesia to Spain to parts\nof the former Soviet Union, the threat of terrorism spawns fear and distracts people from\nthe dreams and vision they once had.\n\nThe inf luence on philanthropy of the focus on global safety has been visible in meas-\nurable ways (giving was down in the United States in 2002 as philanthropy did not\nrespond with its usual safety net to the economic downturn and loss of public funding)\nand in the most subtle ways (people feel a sense of \u201cpsychic poverty\u201d that causes even\nthose who maintained or have now restored their wealth to feel less inclined to give it\naway). In the hierarchy of human needs that Abraham Maslow listed so many decades\nago, we slipped down from the lofty perch of focusing on self-actualization and began\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xviii\n\n\n\nintroduction xix\n\nto worry about food, shelter, and other basic needs as the economy continued to remain\nvolatile even late into 2004. Philanthropy is recovering, and we need only ref lect on the\noverwhelming response from individuals around the world to the plight of those who\nendured and survived the Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 2004 to see that once\nagain, when confronted with extreme human tragedy, people give as much as they can\nto help others.\n\nSo what is philanthropy\u2019s role today? And how does this book\u2014whose ideas seem\nremarkably resilient even 10 years later\u2014become your travel guide for the uncertain\nand sure to be surprising road ahead?\n\nPhilanthropy\u2019s role today is, for me, more important than ever. When kept free of pol-\nitics and based on a mission-secured vision of meeting community needs and enhancing\nthe quality of life, what greater safety line can we grasp in these uncertain times? Com-\nmunity problems do not recede in times of international crisis, they grow. And while our\nsense of helplessness or powerlessness may rise during times of threats to health, security,\nor social conditions, what better way to restore our sense of being able to have an impact\nthan by investing in organizations that are making a dif ference in lives nearby or those far\naway? And there is no more ef fective way to bridge both of these worlds: last year for\nChristmas I \u201cgave\u201d my grandchildren goats, chickens, and rabbits through Heifer Interna-\ntional, animals that are now providing food and industry for families in Asia. Even the\nsmallest children in the family understood the message of philanthropic outreach.\n\nBeyond Fundraising has sold more than 12,000 copies in its f irst edition and is still\nselling well. This new edition incorporates the new context for philanthropy, but the\nsolid principles that have led to this book\u2019s success have not been altered.The values basis\nfor philanthropy is still the only basis; mission is still a ref lection of why an organization\nexists, not just what it does; the importance of regarding donors as donor-investors (or\njust as investors) has grown; vision is still the star to hitch your wagon to; and the basic\nstrategies for annual and capital fundraising are little altered. There is one entirely new\nchapter, the two chapters on planning in the f irst edition have been combined into one,\nand the remainder have been revised, edited, and updated.\n\nIn the near decade since I began the f irst writing of this book, my insights and career\nhave changed along with the philanthropic environment. The variety of clients has not\nchanged (arts and culture, public broadcasting, secondary and higher education, health\nand human services, environment, and religion), but I now spend more time speaking\nand writing. Annual exposure to hundreds and hundreds of people who work or volun-\nteer in philanthropy has spiked my passion for what our sector accomplishes. Increased\nwork with boards of directors has increased my respect for the changes we may have to\nmake in governance policies and procedures to accelerate access by investors. My work\nwith public broadcasting, now an all-consuming role that will continue for the next sev-\neral years, is a microcosm of each of our communities here in the United States, inte-\ngrating arts, education, health, public af fairs, and other programming with community\npartnerships that are based on the reality that broadcasting is not what public broadcast-\nings does, it is how it does what it does. It has provided me a window into all of your\nworlds, and the view is one of potential realized and potential that remains. My work\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xix\n\n\n\ninternationally has likewise given me a new f ilter\u2014to see the life cycle of philanthropy\nref lected in its entirety in a classroom at the International Fundraising Congress is a rare\ngift\u2014and I become less a teacher than a facilitator; less a pedant than a midwife. When\nI hear how an African gentlemen who administers a trust has the responsibility to spend\n$1 million a year on children orphaned by AIDS\u2014and he then tells me there are 1 mil-\nlion children in his country already orphaned\u2014I am humbled by the wisdom he must\nuse to make his decisions. And when I see how philanthropy is soaring in Australia and\nNew Zealand, I am thrilled by the changes I have seen since I f irst went there 11 years\nago to speak at a fundraising conference.\n\nWe work and volunteer in a remarkable sector. Our capacity to build long-term rela-\ntionships will be critical to its further impact. These relationships must be based on an\nunderstanding between organizations and their donor-investors of their mutual respon-\nsibilities. It needs to be a relationship based on partnership, respect, and vision.\n\nThis book is about building those relationships. It is about strengthening the platform\nfrom which you operate so that you can truly soar. Filled with concrete examples and\ntips, it is also abundantly stocked with philosophical and strategic morsels that will sat-\nisfy your appetite for something more meaningful than what is in your in-box\u2014but\nsomething that will help you deal better with the pile of daily duties.\n\nYour role is great and important. Our sector represents hope for the future.\n\nxx introduction\n\nfm.qxd (i-xx)  3/3/05  3:04 PM  Page xx\n\n\n\nPhilanthropic behavior is motivated by values. Board member commitment to serve\nand ask, volunteer enthusiasm, and a donor-investor\u2019s sense of satisfaction in giving are\nbased on an implicit search for ways to act on their values. Matching volunteer, funder,\nand institutional values is a critical practice of successful nonprof it organizations.\n\nPhilanthropy Defined\n\nHistorically, philanthropy was \u201clove of mankind\u201d or (later) \u201clove of humankind.\u201d Its\nmanifestation, particularly in the United States where philanthropy has been practiced\nconsistently since the earliest years of its founding, has included voluntary of ferings of\ntime, money, and goods to meet the needs of communities. The popular perception of\nphilanthropy that grew during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries focused on major\nf inancial support of wealthy individuals like Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and\nin more recent times, David and Lucile Packard, and Bill and Melinda Gates. Recogniz-\ning that philanthropy is historically and in practice much more than giving money, a\nnewer def inition of philanthropy was developed decades ago by Robert Payton in his\nbook Philanthropy:Voluntary Action for the Public Good (1988): all voluntary action for the\npublic good. Based in values, voluntary action includes giving, asking, joining, and serving.\n\nWe know by observation and experience that people do not engage in philanthropic\nactivities on behalf of organizations1 whose values they do not share.The match between\nthe values of our organizations and the values of our constituencies predicts the level and\nintensity of the response a donor or volunteer will have to a cause.\n\nTo be innovative and attract long-term donor investment, organizations in the non-\nprof it sector must def ine and apply their values. They should organize their internal\nsystems, marketing and communications programs, and community outreach to maximize\nthe understanding of, response to, and impact of those values. Only then can organizations\n\nValues: The Context for Philanthropy,\nDevelopment, and Fundraising\n\n1\n\n1\nchapter\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 1\n\n\n\nattract supporters for the right reasons and engage them in a lasting and mutually satis-\nfying relationship.\n\nThe Role of Values in the Nonprofit Sector\n\nComplex and passionate values are often present at the creation of nonprof it organizations.\nWishing to act meaningfully on those values, people create and help sustain organizations\nthat meet a variety of community needs. They do this through their philanthropic gifts\nof time and money.\n\n\u2022 Parents whose son or daughter dies of a drug overdose channel their grief into con-\nstructive options for other young people by creating a counseling program at the\nlocal high school.\n\n\u2022 Because she values independent living and the dignity deserved by all individuals,\nthe grandmother of a developmentally disabled young adult helps create a center for\nher grandchild and for others with similar disabilities.\n\n\u2022 The American Library in Paris is founded by the father of an American poet-sol-\ndier killed in World War I.\n\n\u2022 The families of leukemia patients in Queensland,Australia, help create an apartment\nbuilding where they can stay while loved ones receive hospital treatment.\n\nOther motivations may be less personal but are no less value-driven.\n\n\u2022 In the United States, the movement to keep local and regional symphonies strong and\naccessible is based in values: Community leaders realize that live music performances\nenhance the attractiveness of their communities, that children and adults need oppor-\ntunities to appreciate and learn about music, and that local musicians need to play\ntogether as an orchestra.\n\n\u2022 Public school districts in California and other parts of the United States, constrained\nby cuts in tax revenues, create private foundations to raise money to support jeop-\nardized school programs. They are the invention of parents motivated by values of\nquality and opportunity in education.\n\n\u2022 In Slovenia, citizens ensure the creation of a children\u2019s services agency to replace vital\nhealthcare programs previously provided by government.\n\n\u2022 In countless public broadcasting stations across America, staf f and volunteers wish-\ning to sustain the independent and local media voice in their communities create and\nimplement new ways for their members to invest at higher levels in support of pro-\ngrams that advance classroom education, children\u2019s programming, arts and culture,\ncivil discourse, lifelong learning, and other basic needs of their communities.\n\nGlobal philanthropy is growing exponentially.Throughout the world, communities are\nresponding to changes in traditional sources of services and revenue by creating and sus-\ntaining support for museums, schools, social and human service agencies, and other vital\n\n2 beyond fundraising\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 2\n\n\n\ninstitutions. Motivated by their own values and the values of their communities, leaders\nare taking on new roles as community builders.\n\nWhile inspired by America\u2019s globally unique nonprof it leadership, international phil-\nanthropic organizations are developing their own unique character, ref lecting the values\nand needs of the communities they serve. The growth of the ResourceAlliance, a global\nphilanthropic organization headquartered in the United Kingdom that provides confer-\nences and training to professionals throughout the world, is a stunning sign of this growth.\nFrom a single, modestly attended annual International Fundraising Congress held 25 years\nago in The Netherlands, the organization has grown to sponsor not only its annual con-\nference with capacity attendance but regular regional conferences throughout the world\n(Africa, South Asia, Latin America) that are dedicated to increasing the capacity of orga-\nnizations in these countries to meet pressing community needs through appropriate and\neffective philanthropy.The rapid spread of philanthropy is an unexpected benef it of glob-\nalization, accelerating needed change by drawing on resources and ideas that are readily\nshared among caring people and organizations.\n\nDeveloping a Values-Based Approach\n\nSystems and structures that successfully attract volunteers and funding rely on the iden-\ntif ication of common values. These values become the foundation of all outreach and\noperations. Board members, other volunteers, and staf f know intuitively why they are\ncommitted to an organization or to the voluntary sector, but most have not articulated\nthe values that attract them. Nonprof it leaders, who may be stymied in their ability to\nconvey a fresh or convincing message asking for community support, benef it from revis-\niting the core values of their organizations as a f irst step in addressing their mission and\nmarketing. The results of such an exercise are heartening. Renewed motivation is often\nimmediate, and there is reaf f irmation of founding or sustaining principles.They take the\nf irst step toward values-directed outreach to the community that can result in revitalized\nsupport. One venerable organization, preparing for a campaign to coincide with its 150th\nanniversary, engaged board and senior staf f in a \u201cdeep-dive\u201d session that identif ied their\ncore values.Two outcomes were important: (1) the sense of unity that came from the real-\nization of the extent of their shared values and (2) the ease with which these identif ied\nvalues formed the basis for an entirely new marketing program.\n\nWhether an organization is long-established and looking for a current perspective or\nnew and looking for a solid basis on which to construct its outreach, the identif ication\nof values is a signif icant f irst step.\n\nIdentifying Values\n\nValues orientation is outward. It requires organizations to replace their windows with\nmirrors and identify those aspects of their beliefs and practices that will link with the\nneeds of the community and the values of their existing and potential constituencies. In\n\nchapter 1 values 3\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 3\n\n\n\norganizations that are evolving from a focus on the needs they have to an emphasis on\nthe needs they are meeting, this can be a dif f icult step. Used to conducting community\noutreach and fundraising based on internal f inancial needs, they require some coaching\nto transcend old habits and focus on the core values that can attract and retain like-\nminded people.\n\nValues vary among organizations and donors. Here are some examples of core values\nexpressed by staf f and volunteers in organizations during sessions conducted to discuss\nthe values that motivate people to give to and serve their organizations:\n\n\u2022 A YMCA: youth, leadership, families, community, health\n\n\u2022 An arts education organization: creativity, expression, learning, opportunity, family\ninvolvement\n\n\u2022 A children\u2019s services organization: safety, health, care, concern, families, healing,\nopportunities\n\n\u2022 A medical center: healing, continuum of care, excellence, compassion\n\nSome will argue that the values which drive some people to support highly visible arts,\ncultural, and educational organizations are self-serving: recognition, opportunity to mingle\nwith the rich and famous, or prestige. These motivations should be viewed without crit-\nicism and as opportunities for exploration of other values. A person\u2019s motivation for giving\nan annual or capital gift, as long as it is within the ethical and values framework of the\nrecipient organization, should be the starting point of a relationship. Over time, the ini-\ntial WIIFM (What\u2019s in it for me?) motivation can be converted to a desire to work together\nwith an organization to make a difference in an area of mutually perceived importance.\n\nThe identif ication and nurturing of the values that people bring to their initial inter-\naction with an organization are the f irst steps toward going beyond fundraising.\n\nOrganizations that position themselves as facilitators rather than judges create oppor-\ntunities that bring people into a larger understanding of the impact of their involvement.\nMany initial gifts, given in response to peer pressure during an annual or capital campaign,\ncan, with patience and the application of good listening skills, be not only renewed but\ngrown when the donor\u2019s values are uncovered and matched with the values of the orga-\nnization. While some gifts should not be accepted, and your organization should have\npolicies that indicate sources or purposes that are inappropriate, most volunteers and pro-\nfessionals are wise enough to know when donor motivation is inconsistent with the mis-\nsion of the organization and could lead to a compromise of the institution\u2019s values. Such\ninstances are quite rare, and these gifts are almost always rejected. Many years ago,Yale\nUniversity returned a $20 million gift to the donors. The gift had come with a string\nattached:The donors wished to inf luence the curriculum in the academic area for which\nthe gift was designated. Yale\u2019s commitment to the integrity of its curriculum develop-\nment process prevailed. In another instance, an environmental organization rejected the\noffer of a gift from a corporation whose purpose was counter-value to the mission of the\nnonprof it.\n\n4 beyond fundraising\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 4\n\n\n\nexhibit 1.1 interrel ationship of \nvalues-based phil anthropy,\nde velopment,  and fundr aising\n\nchapter 1 values 5\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nBased in values\n\nDevelopment\n\nUncovers shared values\n\nFundraising\n\nProvides people \nopportunities to\n\nact on their values\n\nA Model of Values-Based Philanthropy,\nDevelopment, and Fundraising\n\nMastery of the interrelationship of values-based philanthropy, development, and fundrais-\ning is a critical achievement for organizations seeking innovative and powerful ways to\nposition themselves in their communities. Exhibit 1.1 shows how these three functions\noperate as one seamless context for donor development. The integration of these func-\ntions is the primary catalyst for going beyond fundraising.\n\nUnderstanding the Model\n\nThe largest element of this model is philanthropy, as redef ined by Payton and others. It\nis the context in which development and fundraising must be set.\n\nMost nonprof it volunteer and staf f leaders, introduced to the bigger idea that philan-\nthropy is all voluntary action for the public good, not just gift-gathering, immediately\ngrasp its role as a larger and more exciting framework in which to plan and set priori-\nties. The challenge to old ways of thinking comes even more forcefully in understand-\ning the dif ference between development and fundraising. In a survey administered as part\nof a video teaching guide by the BoardSource (formerly the National Center for Nonprofit\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 5\n\n\n\nBoards), the majority of participants indicated that \u201cdevelopment\u201d was just a \u201cnicer way\u201d\nof saying fundraising. This model illustrates why that is not true.\n\nThis three-part model distinguishes between development and fundraising and places\nthese functions as embedded in philanthropy. It separates the process of development\nfrom the activities of fundraising and assigns each a dif ferent function within the values-\nframed structure.\n\nThe model has three elements: philanthropy, development, and fundraising.\n\nPhilanthropy: Based in Values\n\nPhilanthropy is the largest part of the model. It is based on the belief that philanthropy\nis directed by values. The research of Payton and others has verif ied this conclusion. We\ndo not give to, ask for, join, or serve those organizations whose values are inconsistent\nwith our own. At the most altruistic, this motivation draws people into a rewarding\ninvolvement with organizations that are advancing and strengthening basic community\nand individual values. At the other end of the continuum, there will be those whose ini-\ntial motivation is WIIFM (What\u2019s in it for me?). These initial motivations (recognition,\nenhanced community position), as discussed previously, can be grown over time into a\ndeeper understanding of mutual benef its for donor and organization.\n\nBecause core values are broad (e.g., dignity, independence, excellence, compassion,\nquality of life), they permit access to organizations by a wide range of donors with dif fer-\ning needs and perceptions. Messages can encompass all or one of these values. Values also\ncross boundaries from one organization to another. Those who value families or health\nor safety will f ind several organizations in a community in whose work they can invest.\nThis reduces the sense of competition among organizations and focuses instead on the\nimportance of fulf illing a values-centered community mission that may be acted on by\nseveral institutions.\n\nTwo Institutions: Common Mission, Common Values\nIn one community, two organizations working with women and their children who had\nexperienced domestic violence combined their ef forts in one community campaign. An\nemergency shelter and a transition housing/job training program conducted a joint fund-\nraising campaign one year under the mutual banner of \u201cbreaking the cycle of violence.\u201d\nAn advertising agency provided high-quality pro bono print and electronic public serv-\nice promotional materials, and a well-respected county supervisor was the keynoter at the\ncampaign kickoff.The two organizations shared more than $75,000 in contributions from\nthe joint campaign. Each organization also conducted its own fundraising activities that\nyear, separate from the joint campaign but ref lecting the common mission. Community\nawareness of the issue of domestic violence was heightened by the joint campaign, and\nresponse to the individual agency campaigns ref lected this as well. The public service\nannouncements were timeless in their production and appeal, and still are seen occasionally\non the local television station.The two organizations attracted new donors who identif ied\nwith their shared values and renewed existing donors who saw with fresh clarity the\nimportance of breaking the cycle of violence.\n\n6 beyond fundraising\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 6\n\n\n\nTranslating Philanthropy: In Conveying Values, the Mission Is the Message\nThe invitation to participate as a donor-investor or volunteer in values-based philan-\nthropy is best of fered through a mission statement that ref lects those values. Many non-\nprof it organizations have succumbed to the pressure of people who are uncomfortable\nwith statements that incorporate values or emotions and have created mission statements\nthat are \u201ccorporate,\u201d describing what the organization does, rather than why.\n\nTo embark on successful values-based philanthropy, development, and fundraising, it is\nvery important to have a mission statement that states why the organization exists. It may\nalso say what the organization does, but the function (what) should be secondary to the\npurpose (why). One major donor to a midwestern public broadcasting licensee parsed a\nmodel mission statement and observed that a good one combines the \u201cusers\u2019 emotions\nwith the station\u2019s (or organization\u2019s) functionality.\u201d An astute observation with applica-\ntion far beyond public broadcasting.\n\nWhat Mission Statements Should Say and Do\nNonprof it organizations exist to fulf ill community needs. People do not give time and\nmoney to organizations because organizations have needs; they give because organizations\nmeet needs. In that spirit, we know that a gift to an organization is really a gift through the\norganization: It is an investment in the community. These are the two key premises for\ngoing beyond fundraising.\n\nMission statements that describe only the function of an organization need to frame that\nfunction with the purpose: Why does an organization exist? What need is being met?\nAlthough some values are present in a statement of what an organization does, the core\nvalues that will ignite interest are more boldly expressed in a statement of why the orga-\nnization exists. The Fundraising School, a program of Indiana University\u2019s Center on\nPhilanthropy, has generated the seminal work in values-based mission statements. Its basic\ncourse materials include numerous examples of statements that answer the question \u201cWhy\ndo you exist?\u201d\n\nTwo Examples of Values-Based Mission Statements\nOver the years, certain organizations have framed and used mission statements that are\npowerful invitations to invest. Vector Health Programs of Eureka, California, which spe-\ncializes in procedures for repairing severe injuries to hands, developed one nearly 15 years\nago that, although no longer in use, remains a stunning model. Its executive director at\nthat time, Karen Angel, prepared the statement as part of a workshop exercise. Her initial\nmission statement, which was a description of Vector\u2019s services, was challenged as not\nanswering the \u201cwhy\u201d question and lacking an expression of core values. In response to\nthe question \u201cWhy do you exist?\u201d she wrote:\n\nNext to the human face, hands are our most expressive feature. We talk with them. We work\nwith them.We play with them.We comfort and love with them. An injury to the hand af fects\npeople personally and professionally. At Vector Health Programs, we give people back the use\nof their hands.\n\nchapter 1 values 7\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 7\n\n\n\nThe statement went on to describe how Vector restores the use of people\u2019s hands. The\nboard chair, hearing this statement the f irst time, was moved to tears. She said she had\nnot realized, until then, just why she was involved.The mission statement had intersected\nwith, and revealed, her values of full participation in life, love, work, and play.\n\nIn another example,Yale University School of Medicine positioned this values-based\nmission statement as the lead to its case materials for a capital campaign conducted nearly\nthree decades ago, when the scientif ic world was in the beginning of the explosion of\nknowledge about genetics. Like Vector\u2019s mission statement, time has not tarnished the\nluster of this strong example of an excellent mission statement:\n\nWe are in the midst of one of the most profound intellectual revolutions of all time, the rev-\nolution in the biological sciences. Its implications for understanding life processes and for com-\nbating disease are boundless.Yale is in the forefront of this revolution.\n\nSuccinct and potent, this brief statement ref lects values of excellence, innovation, and\ninvolvement, and invites those who share those values to participate in the campaign.\n\nA recent example (October 2004) comes from public broadcasting.WVIA in Pittston,\nPennsylvania (western Pennsylvania) has drafted this new mission expression:\n\nPeople change and lives improve when powerful ideas confront us. WVIA is a regional cata-\nlyst, convener and educator, using media, partnership, ideas and programs to advance the best\nattributes of an enlightened society.\n\nGetting Comfortable with Expressing Values\nIt is not enough to have values.To attract those who share them, values must be expressed.\nIf organizations are reluctant to present a values-based mission statement to an increas-\ningly critical and pragmatic public, they still should go through the exercise of identify-\ning their core values and incorporating them into a written expression. The statement\nthey develop may be for internal use only, but its presence will serve to inspire and moti-\nvate those who must engage others in institutional advancement.\n\nOrganizational reluctance to create and publish a values-based mission statement is\npuzzling. A look at most American and international advertising shows how emotions and\nvalues are used for commercial gain. Makers of automobiles, soft drinks, food products,\ncleaning goods, ice cream, insurance, health plans, and other consumer goods are not at\nall reluctant to use values language and benef its in their marketing. A nonprof it\u2019s mission\nstatement is not an advertisement, but it is used to attract potential donors and volunteers\nin the way an advertisement is used to convince the consumer to purchase a product or\nservice. As ref lected in the three mission statements just quoted, there is room for modest\nexpression of emotion in nonprof it mission statements. This emotion is anchored by\nvalues and is never excessive or of fensive. Most nonprof it organizations have an emo-\ntional basis to their origin and impact: To deny this in a mission statement or other mate-\nrials seems oddly contradictory to purpose.\n\nAn advertising executive of fered himself as a constructive critic of his alma mater\u2019s\nseries of fundraising mailings. He cited an overintellectualism that did not ignite any\n\n8 beyond fundraising\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 8\n\n\n\nmemories or emotions for him. He admonished the university\u2019s development staf f to\nevoke the images that stirred nostalgia, a key value among alumni: the smell of a campus\ngrove after a rain, the sound of the stadium at a football game\u2019s halftime, the taste of\ncof fee hastily drunk between classes and with friends. His ideas were incorporated into\nthe next year\u2019s mailings, with positive results.\n\nCreating a Values-Based Mission Statement\nCreating a values-based mission statement is not easy, but it is important to do. The\nembodiment of values in a mission statement can inspire other materials including mail-\nings and proposals. It can be a talking point when recruiting volunteers and the core of\nspeeches and presentations. A mission statement cannot be written by a committee, but\nit will benef it from an initial idea-generating session that involves key constituents. Iden-\ntifying core values is the f irst step.\n\nIn the previously mentioned session at the 150-year-old institution, each person wrote\ndown what he or she believed to be the three core values of the organization.The facili-\ntator then asked each person to state one value from their list. After the f irst round,\nparticipants were asked to repeat the process, stating any values on their lists that were \nnot yet on the master list. Duplications arose by the second round, which is why it is\nimportant to request just one value from each person at the outset. A side benef it of\nthis process is participant awareness of the degree to which they recognize and share the\norganization\u2019s values.\n\nOrganizations will f ind this exercise very helpful in focusing board and staff on common\nvalues. Once these values have been identif ied, the same participants are asked to com-\nplete this sentence:\u201c(Our organization) exists because. . . .\u201dThey should be coached that\nthe statements are not to be written using the inf initive form of the verb (to inform,\nto educate, etc.), but rather as a statement incorporating the values just identif ied and\nexpressing the reasons why the organization exists. This instruction was the inspiration\nfor the mission statement about hands from Vector Health Programs. Examples help get\npeople started on this new approach to mission statement creation.\n\nThese \u201cwhy\u201d expressions, and the lists of core values, provide the raw material for shap-\ning the f irst draft of a mission statement. Assign the writing task to an individual with\nwriting skills and a command of institutional history and priorities. Establish agreements\nregarding the review process and the extent to which the statement will be edited before\nthe writing begins. Many f ine, nimble, evocative, and inspiring statements turn into\nclumsy, inclusive, meaningless, and rambling paragraphs because too many people are\ngiven opportunities to whittle and alter the f irst or subsequent drafts. In one organiza-\ntion, a whole board meeting was devoted to the subtle yet substantial dif ference between\n\u201csocial injustice\u201d and \u201csocial injustices\u201d as contained in the draft mission statement. The\ngroup was divided irreconcilably over the nuance of these phrases, and the mission writing\nprocess was blocked.\n\nOnce a draft has been approved internally, organizations can benef it from circulating\nthe statement to a select group of donor-investors.This group may include former board\n\nchapter 1 values 9\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 9\n\n\n\nmembers, major donors, and others who will respond to and appreciate being included\nin this \u201cinsider\u201d communication. One organization, testing concepts derived from its mis-\nsion for use in a capital campaign, received valuable feedback that led it to shape the cam-\npaign materials in a slightly dif ferent way. The modif ication created a more broadly\nappealing message and resulted in participation by a constituency that otherwise might\nhave not been involved.\n\nAccepting and Using Values-Based Mission Statements\nSome mission statements, ref lecting organizational values and the need the organization\nis meeting, may never receive endorsement by boards or staf f. Instead, leaders may approve\nand publish a more expository statement of the organization\u2019s functions. Although almost\nalways uninspiring, these statements satisfy the need people have within and outside an\norganization for a mission statement that more closely matches those written for corpo-\nrations or law f irms. It is still prudent, however, to have an expression of the institution\u2019s\nvalues on hand.\n\nSometimes a values-based mission statement will be adopted later or integrated into\nmaterials not as a mission statement, but as a framework for expressing the organization\u2019s\npurpose. On numerous occasions, organizations have turned to values-driven expressions\nof their mission when making tough decisions about their future. An organization that\noperated summer camps for a large religious organization found itself turning toward a\nstatement of values and purpose at a decisive moment in its history. The development\ndirector had participated in a workshop in which he was asked to create a mission state-\nment. On his return to his organization, the statement was received negatively.The direc-\ntor kept what he had written, feeling there might be use for it some day. There was. A\nyear later, at a board-staf f retreat, the participants were at loggerheads about the direc-\ntion in which the organization should be heading. Hours of debate created acrimony and\ndissent. A proposed action was outside the mission according to some; to others, it was\nthe next logical step. The development director saw this as the moment to reintroduce\nhis values-based mission statement to the group.When he f inished reading his statement,\nthere was no longer any question about what direction they should take. He had aff irmed\nfor each person the basic purpose of the organization and had redirected their focus onto\nthe need they were committed to meet.\n\nAnother key aspect of writing a values-based mission statement is to position the\nvalues or the need being met as the primary or opening phrase. (This was the case with\nthe Vector,Yale, and WVIA statements discussed earlier.) In this way, people of like values\nare attracted prior to being introduced to the name or function of an organization. By\nstarting with a description of the need that exists and continuing with succinct and pow-\nerful words that tell what the need is and why meeting the need is critical, people who\nshare similar concerns and values are alerted to a deeper purpose. When organizations\nbegin their mission statements with the name of the organization or its principal func-\ntion, some listeners or readers may tune out before the values or purposes are revealed.\nWhen that happens, the opportunity to draw people into the organization\u2019s mission may\nbe delayed or lost. The perceived need must be identif ied f irst.\n\n10 beyond fundraising\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 10\n\n\n\nIt is perhaps apocryphal, but there is a story from Black and Decker that sums up this\napproach. It concerns the Black and Decker drill and the way in which sales associates\nare trained to sell it.They are asked,\u201cWhy do people buy a Black and Decker drill?\u201dThe\nanswer most immediately given is \u201cBecause they want a drill.\u201d But that is not the right\nanswer.The reason people buy a Black and Decker drill, the trainees learn, is \u201cBecause they\nwant a hole.\u201d It is the same with nonprof it organizations. People need to see what need the\norganization fulf ills before they will invest in what the organizations does. Just as people\nonly buy a drill if they want a hole, they only invest in organizations if what the organiza-\ntions provide is something they see as important to themselves and/or the community.\n\nThe philosophical mission statement, expressing institutional values, is a fundamental\ntool for creating a solid constituency and donor development program. It can convey a\nmessage that moves people to action and communicates the impact the organization has\nin the community. It is the context for philanthropy and a fundamental building block\nfor development.\n\nDevelopment: The Process of Uncovering Shared Values\n\nThe second element of the model is development, which functions in the larger context\nof philanthropy. Development embraces, but is not synonymous with, fundraising. Often\nconsidered a euphemism for fundraising, development is much more. Philanthropy is\nbased in values, and development is the process of uncovering shared values\u2014 a process that\nincludes their identif ication, nurturing, and reinforcement through publications, actions,\nand community impact. It is a process driven by the importance of providing potential\nand current funders with opportunities to explore and apply these values on behalf of\norganizations.\n\nOrganizations seldom realize the full potential of the development process. Here are\nsome important insights that can be gained with a more inclusive view of development.\n\n\u2022 Development is a series of deliberate activities through which organizations involve\nand retain funders in a donor-investor relationship.\n\n\u2022 Organizations that realize the power of the development process regard their new\nknowledge as the basis for the revitalization of their development and fundraising\npractices.\n\n\u2022 Development is understood as a much larger and deliberate process, characterized\nby patience and focused on initializing, nurturing, and maintaining relationships.\n\n\u2022 Development is the way nonprof its bring their potential and existing donors into\nan understanding of the impact of their investment on the organization and on the\ncommunity.\n\n\u2022 Development creates donor-investors, individual and institutional funders who seek\nand receive a lasting and dynamic relationship with an organization.\n\n\u2022 Development is based on the premise that all giving is a form of community invest-\nment, the return on which is the knowledge that those values which the organiza-\ntion, the community, and the donor-investor share are being acted on.\n\nchapter 1 values 11\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 11\n\n\n\nWhy Development Must Be a Priority\nTo be successful at fundraising, it is important to spend a lot of time on the development\nprocess.When development is crafted and pursued as the sensitive and systematic process\nit can be, organizations increase their funding stability.\n\nThose organizations that implement long-term strategies for identifying and devel-\noping the match between donor and institutional values, and then focus on develop-\ning relationships based on those shared values, are better able to withstand change. They\nsurvive, and can even benef it from, shifts in the economy, evolutionary funding patterns,\npendulum political changes, and other forces that mar the capacity of some organizations\nto retain donors.We saw this with the economic downturn of the late twentieth and early\ntwenty-f irst centuries and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on America on Sep-\ntember 11, 2001. The pressures on organizations were huge;The environment for rais-\ning funds was softer than it had been in decades. Arts organizations in particular suf fered\nas people turned their philanthropy toward what they felt were more \u201cbasic\u201d human\nneeds.The institutions that suf fered but still attracted investment were those universities,\ncultural organizations, schools, and others that had a solid base of good relationship-\nretaining development practices. Unwavering, even in dire times and with an economy\nturned on its head, these organizations continued their outreach, stewardship, and com-\nmunication. Finally, the recovery began, and these organizations were the benef iciaries.\nDonors embraced their constancy.\n\nBut for every organization that meets this description and is admired as a pacesetter\nlocally, nationally, or internationally, there are too many others whose annual campaigns\nf lounder and whose capital campaigns, when attempted, are either extended repeatedly\nto ensure f inancial success or wither into obscurity without reaching their goal.\n\nThe problem is simply this:When development is not a f irm and deliberate practice\nin an organization, when human and f inancial resources are not deployed toward this vital\nfunction, then fundraising ultimately fails.\n\nDef ining Development\nSo what is \u201cdevelopment\u201d? Development consists of those often subtle, frequently in-\ntangible, and not immediately measurable acts that draw donors and volunteers closer \nto the organization and more deeply into an understanding of shared values. These acts\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 A prospect identif ication and qualif ication process that engages board, other vol-\nunteers, and staf f in the regular and willing generation and screening of lists of\npotential donors and volunteers\n\n\u2022 Development of strategies for approaching potential and existing donor-investors\nutilizing a plan of action based on volunteer-staf f resources and donor interests\n\n\u2022 Cultivation of prospects and donors through a well-articulated series of activities,\nmailings, and opportunities based on a strategic cultivation plan to heighten interest\nand build relationships\n\n12 beyond fundraising\n\nc01.qxd (001-016)  3/3/05  3:02 PM  Page 12\n\n\n\n\u2022 Solicitation of gifts using a donor-centered process that results in the transforma-\ntion of prospects into donor-investors\n\n\u2022 Stewardship practices that engage the donor in a way that is desired and appreciated\nby the donor and that strengthen the donor\u2019s understanding of the extent to which\nthere are shared values with the organization\n\n\u2022 Promotion of overall community visibility of the values-based impact the organi-\nzation is making in the community\n\nStrategic implementation of development practices is the critical prelude to successful\nfundraising and is the key to growing the relationship after the gift has been solicited.\n\nThe exposition and application of these practices is a principal focus of this book.\n\nFundraising\nThe file is too long and its contents have been truncated.\n", "title": "Beyond Fundraising New Strategies for Nonprofit Innovation and Investment, 2nd Edition (Kay Sprinkel Grace) (Z-Library).pdf", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa29d40-3ece-41c7-b999-1735a6168bfd", "request_id": "87de4f7198515244-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa29d40-3ece-41c7-b999-1735a6168bfd", "children": ["9167d084-5ec1-417c-b519-e5a5624c62ca"]}, "9167d084-5ec1-417c-b519-e5a5624c62ca": {"id": "9167d084-5ec1-417c-b519-e5a5624c62ca", "message": {"id": "9167d084-5ec1-417c-b519-e5a5624c62ca", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714718977.566515, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\nPlease remember to search the user&#x27;s documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "78549a2b-95e0-4e6b-ac7c-85674c936cdb", "request_id": "87de4f7198515244-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "78549a2b-95e0-4e6b-ac7c-85674c936cdb", "children": ["03f517ab-7f68-4324-9d4e-1352fe37e9d9"]}, "03f517ab-7f68-4324-9d4e-1352fe37e9d9": {"id": "03f517ab-7f68-4324-9d4e-1352fe37e9d9", "message": {"id": "03f517ab-7f68-4324-9d4e-1352fe37e9d9", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714718977.566699, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["### Chapter 2: &quot;Putting Away the Tin Cup: Changed Attitude, Changed Practices&quot;\nIn Chapter 2, the book discusses the persistent &quot;Tin Cup Attitude&quot; and its implications for fundraising. It explains why this mindset continues due to factors related to the asker, funder, and institutional reasons, and emphasizes the necessity for change in both individual and institutional perspectives. The chapter introduces the concept of viewing funders as &quot;Donor-Investors&quot; and shifts the focus from fundraising to building investor relationships, thereby conveying a new, more empowered attitude towards fundraising. This change advocates for presenting the needs of the organization in a manner that aligns with the interests and values of the donors, rather than a simple plea for funds.\n\n### Chapter 5: &quot;Inviting Investment&quot;\nChapter 5 explores the strategies behind inviting investment from donors. It defines what a &quot;Donor-Investor&quot; is and the importance of building a base of such investors. This chapter discusses the challenges in implementing an investment attitude among organizations and the necessary steps for asking for investment. It outlines the solicitation steps involved in inviting investment, shedding old attitudes, overcoming objections, and increasing organizational involvement in the invitation process. The chapter stresses the importance of adopting a new approach to fundraising that sees donors as partners in the mission, rather than mere sources of money.\n\nThese chapters collectively suggest a significant paradigm shift from traditional fundraising to a more relationship and investment-oriented approach, where the focus is on creating and maintaining long-term engagement with donors as investors in the organization&#x27;s mission and vision. This approach not only helps in securing funds but also ensures that the donors feel valued and connected to the cause they are supporting."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

After an introduction to the problem of overcoming social dilemmas\n\nthrough collective ac t io ,th e  remainder of this article is divided into six sections. The first briefly reviews the\ntheoretical predictions of curently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second\nsection summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by\nextensive erperimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to\nshow how individuals achieve results that are &quot;better than rational&quot; by building conditions where reciprocity,\nreputation  and trust can help to overcome the stong temptations of short-nun self-interest. The fourth\nsection raises the possibiliry of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops\nan  initial theoretical sc ea rio , and the  final section concludes by examining the implications o f  placing\nreciprocity reputation  and  trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.\n\nwe are hand-waving at  our central questions. I am\nafraid that  we do a lot of hand-waving.\n\net me start with a provocative statement. You\nwould not be reading this article if it were not for\nsome of our ancestors learning how to undertake\n\ncollective action to solve social dilem mas. Successive\ngenerations have added to the stock of everyday knowl-\nedge about how to instill productive norms of behavior\nin their children and to craft rules to support collective\naction that produces public goods and avoids &quot;trage-\ndies of the commons.&quot;I What our ancestors and con-\ntemporaries have learned about engaging in collective\naction for mutual defense,child rearing,and survival is\nnot , however, understood or explained by the extant\ntheory of collective action.\n\nThe lessons of effective collective action are not\nsimple\u2014as is obvious from human history and the\nimmense tragedies that humans have endured ,as  well\nas the successes we have realized. As global relation-\nships become even more intricately intertwined and\ncomplex,however, our survival becomes more depen-\ndent on empirically grounded scientific understanding.\nWe have not yet developed a behavioral theory of\ncollective action based on models of the individual\nconsistent with empirical evidence about how individ-\nuals make decisions in social-dilemma situations. A\nbehavioralcommitment to theory grounded in empir-\nical inquiry is essential if we are to understand such\nbasic questions as why face-to-face communication so\nconsistently enhances cooperation in social dilemmas\nor how structural variables facilitate or impede cffec-\ntive collective action.\n\nSocial dilemmas occur whenever individuals in inter-\ndependent situations face choices in which the maxi-\nmization of short-term self-interest yields outcomes\nleaving all participants worse off than feasible alterna-\ntives. In a public-good dilemma, for example, all those\nwho would benefit from the provision of a public\ngood\u2014such as pollution control, radio broadcasts  or\nweather forecasting\u2014find it costly to contribute and\nwould prefer others to pay for the good instead. If\neveryone follows the equilibrium strategy, then the\ngood is not provided or  is underprovided  Yet, every-\none would be better off if everyone were to contribute.\n\nSocial dilemmas are found in all aspects of life,\nleading to momentous decisions affecting war and\npeace as well as the mundane relationships of keeping\npromises in everyday life.Social dilemmas are called by\nmany names, including the public-good or collective-\ngood problem(Olson 1965, P.  Samuelson 1954),shirk-\ning(Alchian and Demsetz 1972), the free-rider prob-\nlem(Edney 1979,Grossman and Hart 1980),moral\nhazard(Holmstrom 1982),the credible commitment\ndilemma(Williams, Collins, and Lichbach 1997), gen-\neralized social exchange (Ekch 1974; Emerson 1972a,\n\nYet, the theory of collective action is the central\nsubject of political science  It is the core of the justifi-\ncation for the state.

She argues that traditional models of rationality fail to account for how individuals collectively overcome social dilemmas. Instead, she points to empirical evidence suggesting that individuals can achieve outcomes better than those predicted by rational choice theory through the development of social norms like reciprocity, reputation, and trust.\n\nThe article outlines the limitations of current rational choice theories and highlights the importance of empirical research in understanding how collective action can be facilitated in practice. Ostrom suggests the necessity of developing &quot;second-generation&quot; models of rationality that better reflect observed behaviors in social dilemmas.\n\nThis address serves as a pivotal point for political science and related disciplines, urging a reevaluation of how theories of collective action are conceptualized and applied, especially in complex and interdependent global relationships.\n\nFor a detailed exploration and specific textual references from the article, consider viewing the document through a PDF viewer or upgrading to AI Drive Pro for enhanced features and document access."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The theory is used extensively in economics, sociology, and political science to model human behavior in various contexts, from market transactions to social interactions and political decision-making.\n\n### Key Points of Rational Choice Theory:\n\n1. **Self-Interest**: It posits that individuals act in their own best interest, carefully weighing the costs and benefits of possible alternatives before making decisions.\n\n2. **Utility Maximization**: The core idea is that individuals seek to maximize their utility, or satisfaction, from the choices they make.\n\n3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Decisions are made by comparing the expected costs against the benefits of an action. A rational actor would only engage in an action if the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\n4. **Preferences**: Individuals have clear and consistent preferences among the available choice alternatives that allow them to order these choices.\n\n5. **Optimal Decision**: It assumes that individuals have the capability and necessary information to assess the choices available to them and select the best possible option according to their goals and constraints.\n\n### Applications and Criticisms:\n\n- **Applications**: Rational choice theory is foundational in theories of market behavior and is also used for models in other social sciences, such as sociology and political science, to explain phenomena like voting behavior, crime, and family relationships.\n\n- **Criticisms**: Critics argue that the theory may oversimplify human behavior, ignoring emotional, ethical, and social influences that can also significantly impact decision-making processes. Critics also point out that access to complete information and the capacity to process it are often unrealistic.\n\nDespite criticisms, rational choice theory remains a fundamental concept used to understand and predict decisions in a broad array of academic fields and practical applications."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

It explores two enduring lessons she taught: a \n\nsubstantive lesson that involves embracing complexity and context, and a methodological lesson \n\nthat involves embracing a framework-driven approach to systematic, evolutionary learning \n\nthrough various interdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches. \n\n \n\nFirst, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons. I illustrate the two lessons through a \n\ndiscussion of the tragedy of the commons. Next, I explain how the two lessons play a significant \n\nrole in recent efforts to extend Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural \n\ncommons. I draw a parallel between the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider \n\nallegory, and show how many of the problems Ostrom explored in the environmental context are \n\nmanifest in the cultural environmental context. I discuss an ongoing research project that follows \n\nthe path that Ostrom blazed and systematically studies commons in the cultural environment. \n\n \n\n******************************** \n\n \n\nElinor Ostrom taught many lessons, as an amazing mentor, teacher, scholar, and human being.  \n\nShe had a profound influence on me, and I am honored to offer this tribute to her.   \n\nLike many others, I was inspired by Ostrom\u2019s design principles for natural resource commons \n\nand the demonstrated feasibility of community-based management for shared resources, and I \n\ntried to follow her lead.  In fact, my first academic talk was about lessons from the literature on \n\nenvironmental commons that map to the study of other types of resource commons, such as \n\ninformation and Internet commons.  I will return to the theme of that talk here.  I will not discuss \n\nher theoretical or empirical contributions as such; many others have done so and will continue to \n\ndo so, and for good reason.  Instead, I will discuss two enduring lessons Ostrom taught about \n\nsocial science research.\n2\n   \n\nThe two lessons can be summarized as follows: \n\n                                                             \n1 The author wishes to thank the editor-in-chief, two anonymous referees, Michael Burstein, Daniel Cole, Michael \n\nMadison, Al Roundtree, Charles Schweik, Alex Stein, and Katherine Strandburg for their constructive comments \n\nand suggestions. The usual disclaimer applies. \n2 Throughout this article, I refer to contributions made by Ostrom and do not list all of her many collaborators \nor people who also made related contributions.  But I want to be clear that she collaborated with many others \nand she readily acknowledged the independent contributions of many others working on similar issues. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nSubstantive Lesson:  Embrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality; avoid \n\ndistorting reductionism and overstated gains from simple models. \n\nMethodological Lesson:  Embrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various \n\ninterdisciplinary methodologies, theories, and empirical approaches, including case \n\nstudies; be aware of, and try to avoid, path dependencies from disciplinary or \n\nmethodological blinders. \n\nThe first lesson leads to the second.  Anyone can say that one should embrace complexity and \n\nstudy reality, and many people do.  What makes Elinor Ostrom incredibly special is that she \n\nworked tirelessly to develop a robust framework for doing it, and she did it, time and again, and \n\nin a collaborative way that built an international interdisciplinary community. \n\nIn Part I, I discuss Ostrom\u2019s work on environmental commons.  I illustrate the two lessons in the \n\nenvironmental context with a discussion of the tragedy of the commons.  Ostrom\u2019s theoretical \n\nand empirical contributions probably are best recognized in the environmental context.  Her \n\ncontributions extend much further, as the Nobel Prize Committee recognized when it awarded \n\nher the 2009 prize along with Oliver Williamson.  Still, there is plenty of work to be done in \n\nexploring and extending her contributions in other contexts.  In Part II, I focus on that \n\nexploration and explain how the two lessons play a significant role in recent efforts to extend \n\nOstrom\u2019s work on environmental commons to knowledge/cultural commons.  I draw a parallel \n\nbetween the tragedy of the commons allegory and the free rider allegory, and then show how \n\nmany of the problems Ostrom identified and explored in the environmental context are manifest \n\nin the cultural environmental context.  I briefly discuss an ongoing research project that aims to \n\nfollow the path that Ostrom blazed and systematically study commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment. \n\nI. Two Lessons from Ostrom\u2019s Work on Environmental Commons \n\nElinor Ostrom\u2019s pioneering work challenged the notion that rational human beings would be \n\nhelplessly trapped in social dilemmas.  Much of her work focused on environmental commons \n\nand confronted the then-dominant and still powerful concept of the tragedy of the commons. \n\nThe term \u201ccommons\u201d generally conjures up the notion of a shared community resource, such as a \n\npublic park or a common pasture. The term gained considerable notoriety among economists, \n\npolitical scientists, and other social scientists after the publication of Garrett Hardin\u2019s essay The \n\nTragedy of the Commons in Science (1968).  Hardin (1968: 1244) described the tragedy of the \n\ncommons as follows: \n\nPicture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep \n\nas many cattle as possible on the commons. \u2026.  As a rational being, each herdsman \n\nseeks to maximize his gain. Explicitly or implicitly, more or less consciously, he \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nasks, &quot;What is the utility to me of adding one more animal to my herd?&quot; This utility \n\nhas one negative and one positive component. \n\n1) The positive component is a function of the increment of one animal. Since the \n\nherdsman receives all the proceeds from the sale of the additional animal, the \n\npositive utility is nearly +1. \n\n2) The negative component is a function of the additional overgrazing created by \n\none more animal. Since, however, the effects of overgrazing are shared by all the \n\nherdsmen, the negative utility for any particular decision-making herdsman is only \n\na fraction of -1. \n\nAdding together the component partial utilities, the rational herdsman concludes \n\nthat the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. \n\nAnd another; and another.... But this is the conclusion reached by each and every \n\nrational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked \n\ninto a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit\u2014in a world that is \n\nlimited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own \n\nbest interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a \n\ncommons brings ruin to all.\n3\n \n\nHardin\u2019s formulation has been the subject of extensive analysis and critique.  At its core, the \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each individual \n\nrationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs, i.e., the costs \n\nimposed on others.\n4\n  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the \n\nshared resource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption is not sustainable, and thus, constraints \n\nmust be introduced if the resource is to be sustained.   \n\nWhat should the constraints consist of?  Hardin recognized two (top-down) solutions:  government \n\nregulation and privatization.  Government can constrain consumption by directly managing or \n\nregulating use of the shared resource.  Alternatively, government can establish a system of private \n\nproperty rights delineating ownership of the resource.  The former presumes that the government \n\nwill take into account the aggregate effects and manage use of the resource efficiently over time, \n\nand the latter presumes that well-defined private property rights will facilitate market exchanges \n\nand lead to an efficient allocation of access and use rights, and consequently, efficient management \n\nof the resource over time (Demsetz, 1967). Both approaches eliminate the commons; no longer do \n\ncommoners freely choose for themselves how to manage a shared resource, for such freedom, \n\nHardin claims, \u201cbrings ruin to all.\u201d  Both approaches rely on collective action through government \n\nto introduce constraints.  The approaches differ substantially in terms of the manner in which \n\nongoing (month-to-month, day-to-day, minute-to-minute) resource allocation decisions are made.   \n\n                                                             \n3 I include the block quote because it is useful to see what Hardin actually said.  Paraphrasing Hardin often leads to \n\nadjustments that obscure or improve Hardin\u2019s simple story.  \n4 In Coasian terms, it is a joint cost problem (Coase, 1960). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\nThe tragedy of the commons allegory became the starting point for examining common pool \n\nresource problems and solutions.  Many analysts assumed the tragedy of the commons model \n\ndescribed a normal problem (at least for common pool resources) and a binary solution set \n\nfollowed:  To avoid tragedy, society must turn to government command-and-control (micro-\n\nmanagement) or private property-enabled markets.  Economists, political scientists, and many \n\nothers analyzed and debated how well these two types of regulatory solutions work.  Will \n\ncommand-and-control regulation by government lead to efficient outcomes or would society be \n\nbetter off relying on private ordering by markets? \n\nElinor Ostrom challenged the entire enterprise at its roots by asking two foundational sets of \n\nquestions:  First, how well does the tragedy of the commons allegory describe reality?  Is it a \n\nuseful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals sharing common \n\npool resources?   Does it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis \n\nfor choosing or designing regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between \n\ngovernment command-and-control regulation and private property-enabled markets reflect the full \n\nrange of options?  Are there alternative (bottom-up) institutions and/or means for collective \n\naction? \n\nCritically, the two sets of questions are related, particularly when one begins with the tragedy of \n\nthe commons allegory.  Hardin blurred resource system with resource management.  In his \n\nallegory, the shared resource system is the pasture, and open access sharing among herders is the \n\nresource management or governance regime.  As did many social scientists, Hardin made a series \n\nof assumptions with respect to both resource and resource management that limit the \n\ngeneralizability of his allegory.  As Ostrom (2007: 15183) explained: \n\nHardin envisioned a pasture open to all in which each herder received a direct \n\nbenefit from adding animals to graze on the pasture and suffered only delayed costs \n\nfrom overgrazing. Translating his metaphor into a theory requires five assumptions:  \n\n(i) the resource system is a pasture;  \n\n(ii) no governance system is present related to the resource system;  \n\n(iii) the mobile individual resource units (the animals grazing on the \n\npasture) can be identified and are the property of their owners and, when \n\nfattened, can be sold for cash;  \n\n(iv) a sufficient number of users, given the size of the pasture, are using the \n\npasture to adversely affect its long-term productivity; and  \n\n(v) the resource users independently make decisions to maximize their own \n\nshort-term returns.  \n\nThese five assumptions \u2026 lead to a theoretical prediction of very high harvesting of \n\nthe pasture grasses and severe overharvesting or destruction of the ecological \n\nsystem.  \n\n \n\n* * * \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nSituations characterized by these assumptions, in which individuals independently \n\nmake anonymous decisions and primarily focus on their own immediate payoffs, do \n\ntend to overharvest open-access resources. Researchers have repeatedly generated a \n\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in experimental laboratories when subjects make \n\nindependent and anonymous decisions in a common-pool resource setting. \n\n \n\nMaking one small change \u2026 in the structure of laboratory experiments, a change \n\nthat is predicted by game theory to make no difference in the predicted outcome, \n\nhas repeatedly had major impacts on interactions and outcomes. Simply enabling \n\nsubjects to engage in face-to-face communication between decision rounds enables \n\nthem to approach socially optimal harvesting levels rather than severely \n\noverharvesting the commons. In the face-to-face discussions, participants tend to \n\ndiscuss what they all should do and build norms to encourage conformance.5 \n\n \n\nNote that when the assumptions hold and fully describe the resource setting, the theory\u2019s \n\npredictions may be useful.  But this is exceptional.  Reality is considerably more complex.  The \n\ntragedy of the commons allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently \n\ncomplete manner as to qualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing regulatory \n\nsolutions.  More is needed. \n\nOf course, it may be convenient to work within the confines of the allegory or model\u2014and \n\nperhaps to assume that reality conforms to those confines\u2014because doing so makes analysis \n\ntractable and leads to a well-defined problem and possible solutions to compare and evaluate. \n\nBut this is a fundamental mistake and an example of distorting reductionism. It can lead the \n\nanalyst to miss what is most important and focus on what is least relevant. \n\nAs Ostrom (2007) explained in the quote above, a slight change, which takes you outside the \n\nconfines of the model, gives rise to solutions that completely escaped attention and would not be \n\npredicted to be relevant.  Relaxing one of the assumptions, or just recognizing that some other \n\nfactor is relevant to the situation, can change everything; cooperation to avoid tragedy becomes \n\ntheoretically feasible without resort to one of the two \u201csolutions.\u201d  As is now well understood in \n\nthe field of institutional economics generally, community management, social norms, and other \n\n                                                             \n5 Ostrom (2000) also critiqued reliance on the rational actor model when analyzing collective action and social \n\ndilemmas.  After establishing a series of \u201cwell-substantiated facts\u201d about human behavior based on extensive \n\nfieldwork: \u201cI believe that one is forced by these well-substantiated facts to adopt a more eclectic (and classical) view \n\nof human behavior\u201d (Ostrom, 2000: 141). She developed a \u201csecond-generation model of rationality\u201d in which \n\nhumans are \u201ccomplex, fallible learners who seek to do as well as they can given the constraints that they face and \n\nwho are able to learn heuristics, norms, rules, and how to craft rules to improve achieved outcomes\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998:  \n\n9).  The second-generation model of rationality predicts that reciprocity, reputation, and trust as \u201ccore relationships\u201d \ncan lead to increased net benefits  (Ostrom, 1998: 13).  This theoretical model identifies \u201cindividual attributes\u201d that \n\nare particularly important in explaining behavior in social dilemmas: these attributes include \u201c[1] the expectations \n\nindividuals have about others&#x27; behavior (trust), [2] the norms individuals learn from socialization and life&#x27;s \n\nexperiences (reciprocity), and [3] the identities individuals create that project their intentions and norms \n\n(reputation)\u201d  (Ostrom, 1998: 14). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\ninstitutional arrangements are relevant solutions that can and often do outperform government \n\nregulation and market regulation.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s contribution goes well beyond recognizing the limits of models and acknowledging \n\nwhat is theoretically feasible.  While it is important to understand Ostrom\u2019s concerns about \n\nmodel-induced myopia, it is equally if not more important to appreciate how she responded to \n\nthose concerns.   In Governing The Commons: The Evolution Of Institutions For Collective Action, \n\nfor example, Ostrom (1990) explained how models such as the tragedy of the commons lead to \n\nmyopic analysis of solutions and policy prescriptions.  She suggested that neither the Leviathan \n\n(government regulation) nor Privatization (market regulation) is a panacea, and that model-induced \n\nmyopia leads analysts to ignore alternative institutional arrangements that may be more effective \n\ntools for governance.  But that is merely the beginning\u2014literally, chapter one of the book (Ostrom, \n\n1990). \n\nOstrom was a scientist.  Her response to concerns about model-induced myopia was to do the \n\nscientific work of systematically studying actual resource systems and governance institutions.   \n\nOver decades, Ostrom demonstrated through a rich empirical program how self-organized \n\ncommunity governance often is an effective alternative for a wide range of shared resources.  In \n\nsome contexts, communities can and do solve tragedy of the commons, collective action, and other \n\nrelated resource management problems without (turning to) government regulation or market-\n\ndriven allocation as a panacea.  They do so in a variety of ways, often relying on informal \n\nmechanisms for coordinating behavior.  Community solutions do not always succeed or always \n\nfail; they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  \u201cThe temptation to seek out regulatory panaceas \n\nbased on universal models, whether through private property, state action, or even notions of \n\ncommunity, must be resisted in favor of a more nuanced approach\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 676). Context matters.     \n\nRecognizing that people sometimes cooperate effectively and build institutions to enable \n\nsustainable shared use of common pool resources opened up the \u201csolution space\u201d and focused \n\nscholarly attention on complexity, context, communities, and institutions.  This broader field of \n\nvision not only brought informal institutions into view and encouraged their systematic study, \n\nbut it also improved our understanding of formal institutions by revealing the many different \n\nways that government, market, and community institutions depend on each other to be \n\nsuccessful.\n6\n And it yielded two significant lessons, one substantive and one methodological. \n\nOstrom\u2019s Substantive Lesson:   \n\n                                                             \n6 As explored in a recent book, Ostrom\u2019s vision allows us to appreciate that government regulation of shared \n\nenvironmental resources does not replace or eliminate the commons altogether\u2014for that would be the true tragedy!  \n\nRather, in many cases, government regulation constructs a semi-commons where a narrow range of resource \n\nusers/uses are constrained in order to sustain \u201cfreedom in the commons\u201d for a wide range of other resource \n\nusers/uses (Frischmann, 2012). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nEmbrace complexity and context\u2014or simply, reality.  There is tremendous value in \n\nsystematically studying actual contexts that present potential tragedies and institutional \n\narrangements aimed at averting tragedies.   \n\nBe wary of model-induced myopia, supposed panaceas, and binary thinking.  The deep problem \n\nwith Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons allegory is not the allegory itself or its translation into a \n\nmodel or even a theory about how people might externalize costs in specific settings.  The deep \n\nproblem is the myopia that the model induced and the binary government-or-market thinking \n\nthat followed.  We consistently make the mistake of thinking in binary terms, individual or social, \n\nprivate or public, market or government.  This leads to great distortions in our perceptions about \n\nthe world and the plans we make.  Reality is much more complicated. \n\nStanding alone, this lesson may be underwhelming, or perhaps even offensive to the scholar.  You \n\nmight be thinking, \u201cThis is not a lesson.  We all know that studying reality beats studying fictitious \n\nscenarios that do not match reality.\u201d Naturally, the next question is how should one go about \n\nstudying reality?  This leads to the second lesson.\n7\n \n\nOstrom\u2019s Methodological Lesson:   \n\nEmbrace systematic, evolutionary learning through various interdisciplinary methodologies, \n\ntheories, and empirical approaches, including case studies.  There is tremendous value in a \n\nresearch framework that facilitates such learning while itself being subject to adaptation and \n\nrefinement over time. \n\nOstrom did not presume community based institutions were successful or ubiquitous.  \n\nCommunity based institutions required systematic study.  To facilitate research on these \n\ninstitutions across diverse resource systems, Ostrom worked for decades on developing a \n\nscientific approach to studying and evaluating institutions.  She devoted incredible energy to \n\nmethodology, bridging disciplines, and enabling systematic, collaborative social science. \n\nTo systematize research, she developed the Institutional Analysis and Development (\u201cIAD\u201d) \n\nframework.\n8\n  It encourages interdisciplinary research and seeks to avoid path dependencies from \n\n                                                             \n7 The risk of model-induced myopia that Ostrom identified also provides a strong basis for taking a pluralistic \n\napproach to thinking about, and teaching, economics, especially if one cannot go out and study reality as Ostrom \n\ndid. \n8 I discuss the IAD framework as a prominent example, but the reader should understand that Ostrom extended her \n\nideas to the development of a more complex framework for the analysis of Social-Ecological Systems (Ostrom, \n\n2009).  Moreover, even when applying the IAD framework, the specific context shaped the research protocols.  For \nexample, as reported in Hayes and Ostrom (2005), Ostrom and colleagues associated with the Center for the Study \n\nof Institutions, Population, and Environmental Change (CIPEC) and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy \n\nAnalysis, both at Indiana University, developed a complex question-based framework tailored for analyzing forests:  \n\n\u201cOur research team spent two years developing a series of ten protocols,\u201d that \u201cenable scholars to examine the \n\nimpact of diverse ways of owning and governing forests (such as individual ownership, joint ownership by a \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\ndisciplinary or methodological blinders, problems akin to the model-induced myopia discussed \n\nabove.  The IAD framework structures a common set of research questions to apply across \n\ndiverse contexts.  Ostrom (2005: 28-29) explained the relationships between a research \n\nframework, theories, and models: \n\nThe development and use of a general framework helps to identify the elements \n\n(and the relationships among these elements) that one needs to consider for \n\ninstitutional analysis.  Frameworks . . . provide the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for the framework.  . . \n\n.  \n\nThe development and use of theories enable the analyst to specify which \n\ncomponents of a framework are relevant for certain kinds of questions and to \n\nmake broad working assumptions about these elements. Thus, theories focus on \n\nparts of a framework and make specific assumptions that are necessary for an \n\nanalyst to diagnose a phenomenon, explain its processes, and predict outcomes. . . \n\n.  Microeconomic theory, game theory, transaction cost theory, social choice \n\ntheory, public choice, constitutional and covenantal theory, and theories of public \n\ngoods and common-pool resources are all compatible with the IAD framework \n\n\u2026. \n\n \n\nThe development and use of models make precise assumptions about a limited set \n\nof parameters and variables. Logic, mathematics, game theory models, \n\nexperimentation and simulation, and other means are used to explore the \n\nconsequences of these assumptions systematically on a limited set of outcomes. \n\nMultiple models are compatible with most theories. . . . \n\n \n\nThe framework-driven approach is functionalist.  It seeks to integrate theoretical and empirical \n\nresearch in coherent manner.  Critically, Ostrom did not reject theories or models, but instead \n\nembraced the idea that different theories and models could work better for some observed \n\nphenomena than for others.\n9\n  The IAD framework aims to systematize research efforts by \n\nfacilitating \u201ca more rigorous evaluation by matching and testing of theories and models with \n\nobserved phenomena, and most generally, enable learning over time\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg, 2010a: 678). It depends heavily on empirical data, and consequently, on a systematic \n\napproach to gathering data.   \n\nThe IAD framework identifies the most general set of variables that should be used to analyze all \n\ntypes of settings relevant for the framework and divides the investigation of such variables into \n\ngroups.\n10\n\n The first group is exogenous variables and includes biophysical characteristics, \n\ncommunity attributes, and \u201crules-in-use\u201d (or governance mechanisms).  With respect to the \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncommunity, and different forms of government ownership) on investment, harvesting, protection, and managing \n\nactivities and their consequences on forest conditions, including biodiversity\u201d (Hayes and Ostrom, 2005: 603-604).   \n9 She did reject the idea of a one-size-fits-all theory. \n10 The following four paragraphs are adapted from Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a: 678-680). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nanalysis of a particular situation, these attributes of a commons are fixed. In the case of the \n\nlobster fishery, for example, these attributes might include the relevant biological characteristics \n\nof lobsters, such as the rates at which they age and reproduce; attributes of the community of \n\nfishermen, such as the proximity in which they live to others, the existence of familial \n\nrelationships, and the skill sets needed for lobster fishing; and the rules\u2014explicit or informal\u2014\n\nthat govern fishing. \n\nThe second group is the \u201caction arena,\u201d which \u201crefers to the social space where participants with \n\ndiverse preferences interact, exchange goods and services, solve problems, dominate one \n\nanother, or fight (among the many things that individuals do in action arenas)\u201d (Ostrom, 2005: \n\n14). In other words, the \u201caction arena\u201d is the context in which the exogenous variables combine \n\nin particular instances, leading over time to observed patterns of interactions and outcomes. \n\nOstrom\u2019s work emphasizes the diversity of possible combinations of exogenous variables that \n\ndetermine what actually happens in particular instances and, hence, the outcomes that result. The \n\nrules governing lobster fishing contribute to the activity\u2019s long-term sustainability, for example, \n\nbut the patterns of interaction actually observed depend on the richness of the particular \n\nenvironment for lobsters, the degree to which rules are actually enforced, seasonal factors such \n\nas weather, and interaction with outside influences such as pollution and the state of the larger \n\neconomy.  Understanding the observed success or failure of a commons enterprise such as a \n\nlobster fishery may require accounting for all of these factors, even though it may turn out that \n\noutcomes are relatively impervious to some of them. \n\nThe foundation of the framework-driven analysis is structuring questions in clusters about the \n\nexogenous variables, the action arena, and the patterns of interactions and outcomes.  This \n\napproach aims to systematize data gathering across complex, diverse phenomena while \n\nremaining amenable to diverse disciplinary perspectives and empirical methodologies. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the IAD framework is its accommodation of and heavy reliance on case \n\nstudies.  Case studies are an important component to the research program because case studies \n\nprovide rich, detailed descriptions of institutional arrangements in context.  In addition, case \n\nstudies provide feedback for the research framework itself.\n11\n\n  Of course, case studies also slow \n\n                                                             \n11 To implement the IAD framework, Ostrom and her collaborators employed a three-pronged approach:  First, they \n\nengaged in a broad range of case studies of natural resource commons to form a basis for a bottom-up practice-based \n\ntaxonomy of successful and unsuccessful approaches to resource management.  Second, they developed a \n\nframework, based on the initial case studies, for identifying the variables that are significant in determining the \n\nsuccess or failure of a commons enterprise and of the viability of institutions in particular contexts.  Third, they \n\npreserved flexibility in their framework so that it could be adapted and revised in response to learning derived from \n\nthe case studies.  Based on the information obtained by applying their framework to structured case studies, they \n\ndeveloped theories and models for particular commons situations, designed experiments to test those theories, and \n\nadvanced a set of design principles for successful natural resource commons (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, \n\n2010a: 676-677). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthings down, making the empirical work more laborious, contentious, and incremental.  \n\nArguably, this is a virtue.  Good (social) scientific research often takes time.  A framework \n\ndriven approach is particularly attractive for studying the complex interactions between \n\necological and social (institutional) systems because of the many different disciplines and \n\nmethodologies that must be brought to bear if progress is to be made (Ostrom, 2009). \n\nOstrom\u2019s embrace of complexity goes further than studying reality and adopting a framework to \n\naccommodate different theories and methodologies.  She also embraced collaboration among \n\ndifferent people, disciplines, and cultures.  She worked hard to \u201cestablish[] a common ground in \n\nthe fractured academic world of the natural and social sciences\u201d (Becker and Ostrom, 1995: \n\n114).  Her work was forcefully interdisciplinary, and throughout her career, she called on various \n\ndisciplines to remove their disciplinary blinders.  In her Presidential Address to the American \n\nPolitical Science Association, for example, Ostrom called for expansion of the \u201ctype of research \n\nmethods regularly used in political science\u201d and suggested that more understanding is required \n\nacross the social and biological sciences (Ostrom, 1998).   \n\n \n\nOstrom recognized that studying commons requires a kind of commons of its own, an \n\ninterdisciplinary community for sharing skills, knowledge, research, and experience.  So she \n\nbuilt one.\n12\n\n  With \u201can ad hoc group of scholars including political scientists, anthropologists, \n\neconomists, historians, and natural resource managers\u201d she founded the International Association \n\nfor the Study of the Commons.\n13\n\n  She was the first President of the IASC.  The IASC\u2019s three \n\ngoals are  \n\n1. to encourage exchange of knowledge among diverse disciplines, areas, and \n\nresource types; \n\n2. to foster mutual exchange of scholarship and practical experience; and \n\n3. to promote appropriate institutional design. \n\n \n\nIn pursuit of these goals, the IASC hosts major international conferences, publishes The \n\nCommons Digest and the International Journal of the Commons, and engages in many other \n\nactivities that promote knowledge sharing and build social capital and connections among those \n\nconcerned with commons.\n14\n\n  Ostrom\u2019s legacy is most vividly seen in the thousands of people \n\naround the world, in many different disciplines and professional settings, who consider \n\nthemselves a part of the research commons she helped construct. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n12 Actually, she built many.  Of particular note, with her husband Vincent Ostrom, also a renowned political \n\nscientist, she founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.  The Workshop is an autonomous \nresearch center at Indiana University dedicated to the interdisciplinary, collaborative, and comparative study of \n\ninstitutions (see Indiana University Bloomington, 2008).  In honor of the couple, IU renamed the workshop, The \n\nVincent and Elinor Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis.   \n13 See International Association for the Study of the Commons (2012b). \n14 For more details, see International Association for the Study of the Commons (2012a). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\nhttp://www.iasc-commons.org/commons-digest\nhttp://www.iasc-commons.org/commons-digest\nhttp://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nII. Applying Ostrom\u2019s Lessons to Commons in the Cultural Environment (or Knowledge \n\nCommons) \n\nOstrom may be most well known among environmental scholars, but her lessons extend well \n\nbeyond natural environmental resources.  Here, I focus on commons in the cultural environment.  \n\nThis label sometimes confuses people; so let me briefly explain.  I use the term \u201ccultural \n\nenvironment\u201d to refer to the various cultural, intellectual, scientific and social resources/systems \n\nthat we inherit, use, experience, interact with, change, and pass on to future generations.  \n\nCommons in the cultural environment thus refers to information commons, science commons, \n\ncultural commons, data commons, and other types of intellectual resource commons \n\n(Frischmann, 2012: 253-314; Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, 2010a; Frischmann, 2007).  \n\nAs shorthand, I and others sometimes refer to these as knowledge commons (Hess and Ostrom, \n\n2005).  There are good reasons for casting a wide net and grouping information, science, \n\nknowledge, culture, data, and so on together.  For brevity, I may refer to one member or another, \n\nbut the analysis that follows applies to all. \n\nIt turns out that intellectual resources have their own \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d-type allegory.  It \n\nis usually invokes the \u201cfree rider\u201d as the selfish actor.  Replace Hardin\u2019s pasture with an \n\nintellectual resource\u2014for example, an idea\u2014and consider what happens when the resource is \n\nopenly accessible to all.  Everyone who can profitably make use of the idea will do so, as much \n\nand as often and in whatever manner suits them.  \u201cSo what?\u201d you may ask, \u201cWhere is the tragedy \n\nin that?  There is no depletion and so there is no ruin.\u201d  Ideas are public goods, not common pool \n\nresources; ideas are consumed nonrivalrously; they have infinite capacity and are not congested \n\nor depleted.  Unconstrained consumption does not seem to pose a problem.  However, there is a \n\ncatch.  We posited an existing idea.  The trouble is that, unlike a pasture, ideas are products of \n\nhuman intellect; they must be created and often require investment.  Unconstrained consumption \n\nof intellectual resources presents a risk for potential investors because it may be difficult to \n\nrecover a sufficient return from those who consume the idea.  We might call these consumers \n\n\u201cfree riders\u201d because they are getting a free ride on the idea creator\u2019s investment.\n15\n\n The result of \n\nfree riding is not too much consumption; rather, it is consumption without payment, and that \n\nmight lead to underproduction of the shared resource, that is, the idea. \n\nWhen viewed from a dynamic perspective, tragic underproduction of intellectual resources \n\nappears to be an inevitable social dilemma so long as consumption is unconstrained.  In fact, the \n\nunderlying problem can be modeled to look exactly like Hardin\u2019s tragedy of the commons \n\n                                                             \n15 There are a number of complications.  First, even if consumers pay something to contribute to the production of \n\nthe public good, they may behave strategically and misrepresent their actual preferences with the objective of letting \nothers bear a greater proportion of the costs (Samuelson, 1954).  This is a variant of the free-riding problem \n\ndiscussed in the text, but it does not correspond to ex post opportunism and is not solved by exclusion via \n\nintellectual property rights (Frischmann, 2012:  265). Second, some consumers (competitors) who obtain access to \n\nthe resource can share it with others at a marginal cost of zero.  Such sharing may fuel competition but undercut \n\ninvestors\u2019 ability to secure a return.     \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nallegory.  At its core, the free rider allegory also illustrates a standard externality problem\u2014each \n\nindividual rationally maximizes his or her private welfare without accounting for external costs.  In \n\nthis context, the social costs encompass the risk to investment and resulting underproduction of \n\npublic goods over time.  Again, the model can be easily translated into a classic collective action \n\nproblem.  Avoiding tragedy seems to require collective action to manage use of the shared \n\nresource.  Simply put, unconstrained consumption appears unsustainable.  A solution is needed.  \n\nIn remarkable parallelism, many analysts simply assume the free rider allegory describes a \n\nnormal (rather than exceptional) problem.  Again, a binary solution set naturally follows:  To \n\navoid tragedy, society must turn to production subsidized by government or to intellectual \n\nproperty-enabled markets.  Government subsidization does not involve introducing constraints \n\non consumption.  Instead, the underproduction problem is dealt with head on.  Government \n\ndirects funds to research activities that yield intellectual resources and thus investment risks no \n\nlonger matter.  These intellectual resources can be shared openly and freely.  On the other hand, \n\nintellectual property rights, such as patents and copyrights, lower the costs of exclusion, enable \n\ntransactions, and mitigate the risk to investment posed by free riders. Intellectual property rights \n\nthus enable markets to function more effectively in supplying intellectual resources.  Both \n\napproaches rely on collective action through government but differ substantially in terms of the \n\nmanner in which resource allocation decisions are made.\n16\n\n    \n\nThe free rider allegory, like the tragedy of the commons allegory, has played a powerful role in \n\nshaping the relevant discourse, policy, and law (Lemley, 2005).  It figures prominently in the \n\nclassroom (textbooks), courtroom (legal opinions), and halls of Congress (political debate).  \n\nYet we should focus on reality and be wary of powerful allegories.  Following Ostrom, we \n\nshould ask two foundational sets of questions:  First, how well does the free rider allegory describe \n\nreality?  Is it a useful theory for making predictions about real-world behavior of individuals?   \n\nDoes it describe a normal or exceptional situation?  Does it provide a useful basis for choosing or \n\ndesigning regulatory solutions?  Second, does the binary choice between government subsidization \n\nand intellectual property-enabled markets reflect the full range of options?  Are there alternative \n\ninstitutions and/or means for collective action? \n\nFree riding\u2014the act of freely using resources generated by another person without payment or \n\neven authorization\u2014is normal.  As I (Frischmann, 2012: 161) argued recently: \n\nfree riding is pervasive in society and a feature, rather than a bug, of our economic, \n\ncultural, and social systems. There are innumerable examples of free riding in society, and \n\nthere is little reason to think that such behavior is inefficiently suppressing investment \n\nincentives systematically throughout society.  Rather, idea diffusion and competition, \n\n                                                             \n16 For a discussion of how government and market resource allocation decisions depend on fundamentally different \n\ndemand signals and evaluation, and how these differences impact the cultural environment, see Frischmann (2012: \n\n109-110, 253-314 ).  \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\namong other important social processes, depend significantly on free\u2014unauthorized, \n\nunlicensed, unapproved and often unpaid\u2014riding.  \n\nThe more difficult question is whether free riding that involves intellectual resources \n\nsystematically reduces incentives to invest in such resources.  Does such free riding normally lead \n\nto a social dilemma?  The claim that it does hinges on certain premises about the behavior of \n\ninvestors.  How does free riding impact actual people who invest time, money, effort, or other \n\nresources to produce intellectual resources?  Does the risk of free riding diminish their incentives \n\nto invest?\n17\n\n   \n\nWhether private incentives are in fact inefficiently suppressed by this risk depends on the type of \n\ninvestment, the intellectual resource in question, and the particular context.  Many intellectual \n\nresources plainly are not subject to this particular concern, as evidenced by the fact that people \n\nconsistently generate the resources without being disabled by concerns over misappropriation.  In \n\nmany situations, people make investments because the expected private benefits exceed their fixed \n\ncosts, regardless of whether or not others free ride.  Appropriating benefits through market \n\nexchange of the intellectual resource or some derivative product may not be relevant to the \n\ninvestor.  For example, we engage in many intellectually productive activities because participation \n\nitself provides sufficient private benefits (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, 2010a; Frey, \n\n2008: 35). Participation can be fun, intellectually stimulating, educational, service-oriented, among \n\nother things (Benkler, 2006; Schweik and English, 2012).  Participation may not be effortless or \n\nfree; it may require substantial investment.  Regardless, the private value derived from \n\nparticipation may be sufficient, and external benefits conferred to others that use or consume the \n\noutput (i.e., the intellectual resource) may be irrelevant to incentives to invest.\n18  \n\nSimilarly, in many \n\nsituations, people create, invent, and innovate because the anticipated returns from their own use of \n\nthe results are sufficient to justify the investment.  There is a rich literature on user innovation that \n\ndemonstrates how many significant innovations result from users seeking to solve their own \n\nparticular problems, needs, or curiosities (Von Hippel, 2006; Strandburg, 2009: 871-888). People \n\noften engage in such activities without disabling concern over free riding.  \n\nThere are many other examples, but the point should be clear.  Free riding does not necessarily \n\nreduce incentives to invest and does not inevitably lead to a social dilemma.  Reality is \n\nconsiderably more complex than the free rider allegory suggests, and there is no good reason for \n\nsystematically marginalizing the many situations in which free riding that involves intellectual \n\nresources does not reduce incentives to invest.  Such myopia is inexcusable.  The bottom line is \n\n                                                             \n17 If free riding does diminish incentives to invest, we would still need to investigate how and to what degree.  \n\nAmong other things, reducing free riding via intellectual property rights likely exhibits diminishing returns in terms \n\nof the impact on incentives.  For further discussion, see Frischmann and Lemley (2007). \n18 Even if those benefits could be internalized, such internalization could potentially decrease incentives to invest \n\nand prove quite costly (Pink, 2010: 37; Amabile, 1996: 17; Benkler, 2006: 298; Frischmann and Lemley, 2007). \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nthat the allegory rarely describes shared resource settings in a sufficiently complete manner to \n\nqualify as a useful theory for making predictions or prescribing solutions.  Much more is needed. \n\nMy hypothesis is that free riding negatively impacts investment incentives and leads to social \n\ndilemmas in only exceptional circumstances, but frankly, I do not have empirical evidence to test \n\nthis hypothesis (nor does anyone else, to my knowledge).  My hypothesis is based on anecdote and \n\nobservation, as well as a broad conception of the relevant universe of free riding phenomena and \n\ncircumstances (investment opportunities).  Regardless, as noted above, I confidently claim that \n\nfree riding is ubiquitous and often quite beneficial in the sense that it is an important feature of \n\ncompetition and idea diffusion in society, often generating positive externalities as free riders use \n\nideas productively (Frischmann, 2012).  Consequently, we must take care when prescribing \n\nsolutions to solve supposed social dilemmas associated with free riding. \n\nEven in situations where free riding reduces incentives to invest and a social \u201cunderproduction\u201d \n\ndilemma arises,\n19\n\n it turns out that there are many complications that are too easily overlooked.  \n\nOstrom\u2019s substantive lesson applies with equal force.  First, there are no panaceas.  Government \n\nsubsidies and intellectual property rights are prominent means for addressing social dilemmas, \n\nbut both \u201csolutions\u201d are far from perfect; both are incomplete and introduce their own \n\ncomplications, biases, and inefficiencies.\n20\n\n  Second, and more important for purposes of this \n\narticle, there are many alternative solutions that people regularly employ to avoid tragedy.   \n\nCommons in the cultural environment are an important set of alternatives that deserve systematic \n\nstudy (Hess and Ostrom, 2005).  \n\nBefore proceeding, it is important to be clear about what I mean when I refer to commons; the \n\nconcept is remarkably fluid and varies considerably in its usage across different disciplines.  \n\nHere is how I use it:   \n\nCommons is an institutionalized community practice, a form of community management or \n\ngovernance.  It applies to resources, and it involves a group or community of people, but the \n\ncommons itself is not the resources, the community, a place, or a thing. Commons is the \n\ninstitutional arrangement of these elements.  \u201cThe basic characteristic that distinguishes \n\ncommons from noncommons is institutionalized sharing of resources among members of a \n\ncommunity\u201d (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, 2010b: 841).  Critically, there is incredible \n\nvariance among commons in terms of the types of resources and communities, and consequently, \n\nin terms of the institutions through which governance is practiced or implemented.  Of course, \n\nthere are various obstacles to sustainable sharing.  The tragedy of the commons allegory \n\nhighlights one, and the free riding allegory highlights another.  In reality, communities can and \n\noften do overcome these and other obstacles through constructed as well as emergent \n\n                                                             \n19 The classic example of a context in which this dilemma arises is the pharmaceuticals industry (Burk and Lemley, \n\n2009.) \n20 There is a rich literature that defies a brief summary.  \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\ncommons.\n21\n\n  And yet, as Ostrom made clear, commons can and often do fail, and thus demand \n\nsystematic study. \n\nCommons in the cultural environment refers to the institutionalized community practice of \n\nsharing information, science, knowledge, data, and other types of intellectual and cultural \n\nresources.  Many communities regularly share such resources and overcome concerns about free \n\nriding and other dilemmas.\n22\n\n  \n\nMost obvious may be research commons, given the importance of sharing and collaboration \n\nnorms within scientific research communities (Reichman and Uhlir, 2003; Merton, 1973).  \n\nReichman and Uhlir (2003) examined scientific data commons, pressures on the \u201csharing ethos\u201d \n\nwithin various scientific communities, and institutional means for reconstructing commons.  \n\nCook-Deegan and Dedeurwaerdere (2006) examined research commons in the life sciences and \n\nmapped out some of the relationships between the structure and function of the resource \n\ncommons and the relevant community.  The National Research Council of the National \n\nAcademies sponsored an international conference in 2009 that explored microbial research \n\ncommons.  Participants examined how upstream microbial research inputs\u2014microbial data, \n\nliterature, and research materials\u2014can be managed as a commons (Uhlir, 2011; Reichman, \n\nDedeurwaerdere and Uhlir, forthcoming).   \n\nMadison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a) discussed the following less obvious examples:  \n\nintellectual property pools, in which owners of patents in a technological domain license their \n\npatents to a common \u201cpool\u201d from which producers of complex products can obtain all of the \n\npermissions needed to make and sell goods that use the patents; open source computer software \n\nprojects, which offer users of open source programs the ability to create and share modifications \n\nto the programs;\n23\n\n Wikipedia, which offers users of this Internet encyclopedia the power to add to \n\nand edit its contents; the wire service for journalism operated by the Associated Press, which \n\nallows individual member media outlets the opportunity to publish work produced by other \n\nmembers; and \u201cjamband\u201d fan communities, which record, share, and comment on musical \n\nperformances of their favorite groups\u2014with the permission of the artists themselves.  We \n\nmentioned additional examples, including medieval guilds, \u201cthe modern research university and \n\n                                                             \n21 The distinction between constructed and emergent commons arose in the exchange we had with Professors Wendy \n\nGordon and Gregg Macey in the Cornell Law Review (Gordon, 2010: 735,n.14; Macey, 2010: 785-780; Madison, \n\nFrischmann and Strandburg, 2010b: 846-847). \n22 Some dilemmas arise from the traditional solutions to the free rider problem.  For example, intellectual property \n\nrights can interfere with productive use of intellectual resources and deter investments in areas where investors \n\nperceive a threat of exclusive rights \u201cblocking\u201d utilization or further development.  I will not explore the various \n\ndilemmas here, but I would like to make clear that commons are sometimes constructed to overcome problems \ncreated by intellectual property rights (e.g., avoiding a so-called anti-commons).  Yet in other contexts, intellectual \n\nproperty rights are critical inputs for creating a commons and facilitating cooperation and joint production (e.g., \n\nopen source software development projects, such as Linux) (Madison, Frischmann and Strandburg, 2010a). \n23 For a systematic study of open source software projects using the IAD Framework, see Schweik and English \n\n(2012).   \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nthe departmental and disciplinary structures that lie within and above it,\u201d and the Request for \n\nComments (\u201cRFCs\u201d) series that defines the technical protocols of the Internet.  During a \n\nconference hosted at New York University in 2011, scholars presented case studies that ranged \n\nfrom rare disease research consortia to recreational roller derby leagues.   \n\nThere are many different commons in the cultural environment.  Yet we know very little about \n\nthem:  How do such commons work?  Where do they come from, what contributes to their \n\ndurability and effectiveness, and what undermines them?   \n\nIn the past decade, scholars in various disciplines have become interested in studying these types \n\nof commons, and some have begun case studies.  However, their research too often is focused \n\nnarrowly on the specific case or an isolated area, such as academic publishing or open source \n\nsoftware, and fails to investigate the broader institutional questions and to appreciate the need for \n\nsystematic analysis.\n24\n\n  As a result, they tend to consider only a limited number of descriptive \n\nvariables, which makes integration and learning from a body of case studies quite difficult. \n\nGuided by Ostrom\u2019s methodological lesson and building on her IAD framework as well as her \n\npioneering book with Charlotte Hess (Hess and Ostrom, 2005), Madison, Frischmann and \n\nStrandburg (2010a) developed a research framework to facilitate systematic study of commons in \n\nthe cultural environment.  The underlying nature and structure of the inquiry as well as the focus \n\non complexity, context, communities, and institutions unites our project with her legacy.  \n\nNonetheless, we needed to adapt and extend the IAD framework to account for significant \n\ndifferences between commons in the natural environment and commons in the cultural \n\nenvironment.  Most obvious, the resources are different, and as a result, the obstacles that must \n\nbe overcome for institutionalized sharing to work are different.  Thus, for example, the \n\ngovernance structures for commons in the cultural environment manage existing resources as \n\nwell as production and integration of new resources.  Another interesting complication is the \n\ncomplex role of legal institutions in delineating intellectual resources, for example, by defining \n\nwhat constitutes the expression in software that might be governed by open source software \n\nlicenses.  Notably, this complication raises resource boundary and corresponding resource \n\nmanagement issues that are less salient for commons in the natural environment. \n\nMadison, Frischmann and Strandburg (2010a) explored these and other differences extensively, \n\nand explained why the differences call for a series of inquiries specifically tailored to commons \n\nin the cultural environment.  It turns out that the exogenous variables are more intertwined in this \n\ncontext because separating the managed resources from the attributes and rules-in-use of the \n\ncommunity that produces them can be incredibly difficult, if not impossible in some \n                                                             \n24 This is not a critique of those scholars.  The point is that someone carefully studying a particular information \n\ncommons\u2014say, a patent pool\u2014may not appreciate\u2014much less have the tools or incentives to observe, record, and \n\nevaluate\u2014the many descriptive variables concerning the shared resources, community members, institutions, and \n\ncontext that would facilitate comparison with other commons in the cultural environment\u2014say, other intellectual \n\nproperty pools, open source projects, online commons-based peer-production, jambands, and so on.  \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\ncontexts.  Moreover, distinguishing outcomes from resources and community attributes is not \n\nalways strictly possible, since the interactions of the participants in these commons are \n\ninextricably linked with the form and content of the knowledge output, which in turn is itself a \n\nresource for future production.  At this stage, we have identified the most general set of variables \n\nthat should be used to analyze all types of settings relevant for our framework and divided the \n\ninvestigation of such variables into groups of questions, summarized in the following \n\nabbreviated outline: \n\nI. Background Environment \n\na. What is the background context (legal, cultural, etc.) of this particular commons? \n\nb. What is the \u201cdefault\u201d status of the resources involved in the commons?  Patented?  \n\nCopyright? Open? \n\n \n\nII. Attributes of the Commons \n\na. Resources \n\ni. Identify all resources being pooled and how they are created or obtained \n\nii. Describe the characteristics of the resources, such as whether they are rival \n\nor non-rival, whether they are tangible or intangible, the technologies \n\nneeded to create, obtain, or maintain them, and the technologies and skills \n\nrequired to use them \n\nb. Community Members \n\ni. Identify community members and describe their roles \n\nii. Describe the degree and nature of openness of the community with respect \n\nto each type of community member and the general public \n\nc. Goals and objectives of the commons \n\ni. Identify the goals and objectives of the commons \n\nii. Identify the history and narrative of the commons \n\n \n\nIII. Governance \n\na. What are the governance mechanisms of the commons (e.g., membership rules, \n\nresource contribution or extraction standards and requirements, conflict resolution \n\nmechanisms, sanctions for rule violation) \n\nb. Who are the decision-makers and how are they selected? \n\nc. What are the institutions that govern decision-making? \n\nd. What informal norms govern the commons? \n\ne. How do nonmembers interact with the commons?  What institutions govern those \n\ninteractions? \n\nf. What legal structures (including intellectual property rules, subsidies, contract and \n\nlicensing law, antitrust provisions) govern the functioning of the commons? \n\n \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nIV. Patterns and Outcomes \n\na. What benefits are delivered to members and to others (including innovations and \n\ncreative output, production, sharing, and dissemination of those innovations and \n\noutput to a broader audience, and social interactions that emerge from the \n\ncommons?) \n\nb. What costs and risks are associated with the commons, including, for example, \n\nany negative externalities? \n\n \n\nEssentially, these clusters of issues guide more detailed inquiry.  Case studies across disciplines \n\nand reviews of existing literature that address commons in the cultural environment will help \n\nspecify relevant attributes within each cluster.  We are developing a coding manual for case \n\nstudies, and we expect the framework to evolve further as researchers apply it to specific case \n\nstudies.  This process is currently underway.   \n\nTaking another page from Ostrom\u2019s lesson book, we have begun to build an international and \n\ninterdisciplinary research community.  Many case studies are underway; more are being planned.  \n\nIt may be a while before we have any major scientific findings to report; it may be slow-going, \n\nlaborious, and incremental.  But that is fine because, as Ostrom showed us, good (social) \n\nscientific research often takes time. \n\nConclusion \n\nElinor Ostrom received the Nobel Prize because of her groundbreaking and path-setting research.  \n\nMany people are only starting to realize and understand the import of her theoretical and \n\nempirical contributions to institutional economics.  These contributions will continue to shape \n\nresearch and education in economics, political science, law, and other disciplines concerned with \n\ninstitutions that shape collective action and community governance of shared resources.   \n\nThe two enduring lessons I highlighted in this article are more basic.  They derive from her \n\nscientific approach to research, and her corresponding demand for rigorous, systematic inquiry.  I \n\nam grateful to have learned these lessons, as I believe they provide a basis for continuing her \n\nwork and extending it to other contexts.  Commons in the cultural environment are one example, \n\nbut there are others\u2014e.g., infrastructure commons and privacy commons.  Simple models of \n\nsocial dilemmas, as well as binary thinking about solutions (government versus market), are \n\nlegion. \n\nI am grateful to have known Elinor Ostrom and to have learned all that she taught me.  She is \n\nmissed, but she remains present in the minds and hearts of the many people she influenced, as \n\nher dedication and insights inspire and fuel future work. \n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2252133\n\n\n\nJournal of Institutional Economics (forthcoming 2013) \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n  \n\nAmabile, T.

Frischmann, &quot;Two Enduring Lessons from Elinor Ostrom,&quot; pays homage to Ostrom&#x27;s profound influence on understanding and managing commons\u2014resources shared by a community, whether they be environmental, cultural, or knowledge-based. The article distills two major lessons from Ostrom&#x27;s work:\n\n1. **Embrace Complexity and Context**: Ostrom advocated for recognizing the nuanced realities of managing commons, which often defy simplistic theoretical models. Her work demonstrated that local, community-based management could successfully govern shared resources without the need for heavy-handed governmental or private control, challenging the prevailing &#x27;tragedy of the commons&#x27; narrative.\n\n2. **Systematic, Evolutionary Learning**: Ostrom promoted a methodological approach that spans various disciplines and emphasizes continuous learning and adaptation. This approach involves detailed case studies and the development of frameworks like the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which guides the systematic study of different commons arrangements.\n\nFrischmann discusses how these lessons apply not only to environmental resources but also to knowledge and cultural commons, where issues of access and management resemble those in environmental contexts. The author emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research and the need for a flexible, evolving approach to studying and managing commons, reflecting Ostrom&#x27;s legacy of innovative, applicable research methodologies.\n\nOverall, the article serves as both a tribute to Ostrom&#x27;s enduring influence and a call to apply her insights more broadly across disciplines to better understand and manage shared resources."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Beier 1,2, Amy Lauren Lovecraft 1, and F. Stuart Chapin, III 1\n\nABSTRACT. Large-scale government efforts to develop resources for societal benefit have often\nexperienced cycles of growth and decline that leave behind difficult social and ecological legacies. To\nunderstand the origins and outcomes of these failures of resource governance, scholars have applied the\nframework of the adaptive cycle. In this study, we used the adaptive cycle as a diagnostic approach to trace\nthe drivers and dynamics of forest governance surrounding a boom\u2013bust sequence of industrial forest\nmanagement in one of the largest-scale resource systems in U.S. history: the Tongass National Forest in\nsoutheastern Alaska. Our application of the adaptive cycle combined a historical narrative tracing dynamics\nin political, institutional, and economic subsystems and a longitudinal analysis of an indicator of overall\nsystem behavior (timber harvests). We found that federal policies in concert with global market changes\ndrove transformative change in both forest governance (policy making) and forest management (practices),\nthrough creation and dissolution of subsidized long-term lease contracts. Evidence of the systemic resilience\nprovided by these leases was found in the analysis of industry responses to market volatility before and\nafter Tongass-specific federal reforms. Although the lease contracts stabilized the Tongass system for a\nperiod of time, they fostered a growing degree of rigidity that contributed to a severe industrial collapse\nand the subsequent emergence of complex social traps. Broader lessons from the Tongass suggest that\nlarge-scale changes occurred only when the nested economic and policy cycles were in coherence, and a\nsystemic effort to minimize social and ecological variability ultimately resulted in catastrophic collapse of\ngovernance. This collapse resulted in a pervasive and challenging legacy that prevents Tongass\nreorganization and limits the adaptive capacity of the larger social\u2013ecological system of southeastern\nAlaska. Although this legacy has inhibited system renewal for two decades, recent trends indicate the\nemergence of new opportunities for progress toward sustainable governance of the Tongass National Forest.\n\nKey Words: adaptive cycle; Alaska; forest management; resource governance; rigidity traps; U.S. National\nForests\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGovernment efforts to stimulate the development of\nnatural resources for public benefit often seek to\nimplement a vision at grand scales that, over time,\ncreates a cycle of dependency that undermines the\noriginal social purpose as well as the resource base\nthat was intended to be sustained. In the United\nStates, this has occurred with respect to agriculture\n(Light et al. 1995), forestry (Repetto 1998, Trosper\n2003), fisheries (Francis and Reiger 1995, Pauly et\nal. 2005), water (Ostrom 1990, Lee 1995), and many\nother types of resource systems (Holling and Meffe\n1996). Similar cycles of dependency have emerged\n\nthrough international aid programs to developing\nnations that were intended to create self-sufficiency\nthrough resource development. Although the goals\nof these programs are often socially admirable and\nprovide an economic stimulus to initiate changes\nthat would otherwise lack the resources to emerge\n\u2014i.e., to escape from poverty traps (Carpenter and\nBrock 2008)\u2014they often result in challenging\nsocial traps (Costanza 1987) that can constrain\noptions for future generations. Why have these\ngovernance efforts failed so consistently, and what\nlessons can be learned that would enlighten efforts\nto address new frontiers of resource governance and\npublic welfare in a rapidly changing world?\n\n1University of Alaska-Fairbanks, 2SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\nmailto:cbeier@esf.edu\nmailto:ffall@uaf.edu\nmailto:terry.chapin@uaf.edu\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nIn this article, we analyze the rise, collapse, and\naftermath of one of the largest resource governance\nprograms in the history of the United States:\nindustrial timber production in the Tongass National\nForest (Tongass) of southeastern Alaska. Although\nlarge-scale industrial forestry emerged as a\nmechanism for stimulating social welfare and\neconomic growth, the Tongass has become one of\nthe most controversial issues of public land\nmanagement in the United States (Wilkinson 1997).\nAs such, its story has been framed in several ways:\nas the central theme in the history and purpose of\nthe U.S. Forest Service in Alaska (Rakestraw 1989);\nas an acute example of political influence,\nmismanagement, and corruption resulting in\nenvironmental degradation (Durbin 1999); as a\ncomplex situation governed by entrenched\ninfluences and acrimonious personal relationships,\nas described by a former agency chief (Steen 2004);\nas a local drama of lost jobs and livelihoods due to\n\u201ceconomic vandalism\u201d by environmentalists\n(Soderberg and DuRette 1988); and as a study of\ncumulative regulatory complications and policy\nreforms resulting in conflicted governance and a\n\u201cdeadlock\u201d among institutions and stakeholder\ngroups (Nie 2006).\n\nAlthough each account yields valuable insights,\nthey present an incomplete and often normative\npicture of the Tongass case and its broader\nimplications for the regional social\u2013ecological\nsystem (SES) of southeastern Alaska; and therefore,\nprovide little guidance on how resource systems\nmight be more effectively governed for long-term\nsustainability and greater public benefit. In this\narticle, we present the first analysis that examines\nthe links among policy, institutions, economies, and\necosystems that shaped the governance of the\nTongass during the 20th century. We apply a\nresilience lens and use the framework of the\nadaptive cycle (Holling and Gunderson 2002) as a\ndiagnostic tool to investigate the nested attributes\nof the Tongass system (Ostrom 2007). Building on\na previous group of adaptive-cycle studies of\nmanagement and governance systems (Gunderson\net al. 1995), we (1) developed an adaptive-cycle\nnarrative of the Tongass coupled with a quantitative\nindicator of system behavior (annual timber\nharvests), (2) traced the adaptive cycles of policy,\ninstitutional, and economic subsystems to identify\nsynergistic feedbacks that drove transformative\nchange at larger scales, and (3) compared adaptive-\ncycle interactions among subsystems to identify\nsources of resilience and vulnerability.\n\nObjectives and Key Questions\n\nIn this case study, we apply the adaptive cycle as\nboth a theoretical framework and a diagnostic\nmethod to reveal the dynamics and interactions of\na resource governance and management system\nnested within a larger SES. We chose the adaptive\ncycle because the Tongass boom\u2013bust cycle typified\nthe \u201cpathology of resource management\u201d (Holling\nand Meffe 1996), characterized by a cyclical pattern\nof dynamics that links ecological (resource) and\nsocial (governance) systems in a higher-order\ncoupled system (SES) (Gunderson et al. 1995,\nHolling et al. 2002b). The adaptive cycle explains\nthe dynamics of a system that is initiated\n(organization [\u03b1]), mobilizes and develops (growth\n[r]), attains a stable configuration (conservation\n[K]), changes to a different structure (collapse [\u2126]),\nand begins the process anew (reorganization [\u03b1]).\nOur focus is on the coupled cycles of change in\ngovernance (through policy and leadership),\nresource management (through practices and\nplanning), and private industry (through processing\nand sale of forest products), and their overall\nimpacts on the southeastern Alaska SES. The\nadaptive-cycle framework supports the systematic\nidentification of key interactions and feedbacks\namong system components that drove system\ndynamics, allowing us to address the following\nquestions:\n\n\u25cf What factors (ecological, economic, cultural,\npolitical) had the greatest overall influence\non stability and change in Tongass\ngovernance and management?\n \n\n\u25cf What aspects of Tongass governance (via\npolicy) and forest management (via practice)\nwere especially vulnerable to drivers of\nchange?\n \n\n\u25cf How did the system stabilize itself against\nexternal perturbation?\n \n\n\u25cf What was the source of this resilience and\nhow was it eventually lost? Was collapse\ntriggered by changes in one or many aspects\nof the system?\n \n\n\u25cf What aspects of the Tongass system resulted\nin the social\u2013ecological legacy that currently\ninhibits renewal toward a more sustainable\nsystem of forest governance?\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n \n\u25cf How does this legacy inhibit progress? How\n\ncan this legacy be overcome to facilitate\nsystem renewal and restore adaptive\ncapacity?\n\nA Systems Framework\n\nWe define the \u201cTongass system\u201d as a coupled\nsystem of governance (the set of structures and\nprocesses by which people make decisions and\nshare power) and management (the set of actions\nthat manipulate a system to achieve desired\noutcomes) nested within in the larger SES. We\nrecognize three nested subsystems of the Tongass\nsystem (Fig. 1): the \u201cinstitutional subsystem,\u201d\nincluding the U.S. Forest Service, principally the\nTongass administration; the \u201cpolicy subsystem\u201d\nthat governs Tongass management and land-use\ndecision making; and the \u201ceconomic subsystem\u201d\nthat defines the structure, capacity, and efficiency\nof the regional industry and market value of its\nproducts. Each subsystem may experience adaptive\ncycles of change influenced by internal components\nand drivers of change (e.g., Tongass managers and\ntheir preferences, legislation specific to Tongass\ngovernance, and economic factors pertaining to\nlocal industry) as well as external components and\ndrivers (e.g., national leadership in the Forest\nService, federal legislation, and global timber\nmarkets) (Fig. 1). Our approach is to explain larger-\nscale SES dynamics by describing the subsystem\ndynamics, which are more easily observed and can\ngenerate transformative feedbacks at larger scales\n(Walker et al. 2004).\n\nIn this article, governance concerns the decisions\nmade regarding the policy goals for the Tongass in\nthe context of a broader vision and purpose for the\nregion of southeastern Alaska, specifically its\ncommunities and natural resources. Management is\nthe active implementation of specific practices, such\nas industrial even-aged forestry, to reach these\nobjectives. Governance emerges primarily from the\npolicy subsystem and management emerges\nprimarily from the institutional subsystem, although\nthe two are functionally coupled.\n\nFor this case study, we narrowly define the regional\necosystem with a focus on environmental factors\nthat directly influenced governance and management,\n\nand the processes that controlled ecological\nresponses to management practices. These include\nthe condition of the old-growth forest resource,\nspatial variation in forest productivity, and the\nremote and rugged geography of the region that\nshaped the options available for resource\ndevelopment (Fig. 1). We did not address\nsuccessional dynamics because these primary\nforests were largely unmodified by human actions\nwhen industrial forestry began, and because second-\ngrowth forests did not reach a harvestable age during\nthe short lifespan of industrial forestry in the region.\nHanley et al. (2005) and Beier et al. (2008) address\nthe longer-term ecological implications of clearcut\nharvesting and even-aged management practices in\nthe temperate rainforests of southeastern Alaska.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nUsing this system structure and the adaptive-cycle\nframework, we developed a historical narrative of\nthe Tongass system that traces a complete loop of\nthe adaptive cycle, beginning with the creation of\nthe Tongass National Forest (1908), passage of key\nlegislation fostering industrial development (1947),\nboom years during which timber production peaked\n(1970), collapse of the regional industry (1997), and\nthe contentious stalemate of the present day (2009).\nIn parallel with this narrative, we traced system\ndynamics using annual timber outputs, a\nquantitative variable reflecting an emergent\nproperty of the Tongass system. Based on this\nlongitudinal analysis (Fig. 2) and a historical\ntimeline of key events in Tongass governance and\nmanagement (Appendix 1), we described the\nadaptive cycle of each subsystem, the cross-\nlinkages among adaptive cycles, and events that\ntriggered \u201ctipping points\u201d in the larger SES. In\nsummarizing the narrative, we address our research\nquestions and revisit Holling and Meffe\u2019s (1996)\n\u201cpathology of resource management\u201d concept to\ndraw broader conclusions from the Tongass case.\n\nSYSTEMS NARRATIVE\n\nOrganization Phase [\u03b1] 1908\u20131947\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the foundations\nof the Tongass system emerged during its\norganization [\u03b1] phase\u2014analogous to the \u201cpioneer\u201d\nstage of forest succession, when several interacting\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nFig. 1.

In\nthe Tongass, the arrival of new actors, conditions,\nand drivers of change interacted to dictate the\nstructure, dynamics, and controls over the future\nsystem.\n\nDuring the 19th century, forests in southeastern\nAlaska were harvested only for local use, primarily\nto support fur traders, the salmon industry, and the\n\nGold Rush. In 1908\u2014a decade after the U.S. Forest\nService was established, four decades after Alaska\u2019s\npurchase from Russia, and coincident with public\nrecognition of Alaska\u2019s natural wealth in gold,\nsalmon, and timber\u2014the 6.7 million acre Tongass\nNational Forest was established, and within a year,\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt and U.S. Forest\nService founder Gifford Pinchot expanded the\nTongass by an additional 8.7 million acres to create\nthe largest national forest in the United States.

Longitudinal analysis of annual timber harvest outputs from the Tongass National Forest and\nsubsystem dynamics (see Appendix 2), divided into the four phases of the adaptive cycle: organization,\ngrowth, conservation, and collapse.\n\nits earliest beginnings, Tongass managers were\npioneers of a broad vision to encourage regional\npopulation growth and establish a clear U.S.\npresence in Alaska by developing a strong, self-\nsufficient economy based on timber production\n(Rakestraw 1989, Nie 2006). The roots of the\nTongass approach\u2014to convert old-growth forests\nto \u201cmore manageable\u201d second-growth stands, while\nfueling a forest-products industry based on pulp and\nsawtimber\u2014were evident upon completion of the\nfirst federal inventories. In 1909, Tongass officials\nsuggested that pulp production was the best use of\nold-growth rainforests, that \u201cthe chief need is for a\n\nplanned harvest of the mature timber\u201d (Rakestraw\n1989:23), and recommended revision of federal law\nto allow the sale of National Forest lands for\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, this industrial approach required\nsignificant private investment to establish a\nsufficient economy of scale to make Tongass timber\nprofitable. Despite the pursuit of such investments\nby key figures, including U.S. Forest Service Chief\nWilliam Greeley in the 1920s and Alaska Regional\nForester Frank Heintzleman throughout the 1930s\nand 1940s, these efforts were thwarted by economic\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nconstraints, including poor regional infrastructure,\ndistance from markets, and the Great Depression.\n\nWorld War II and its aftermath provided the catalyst\nto implement industrial forestry in the Tongass,\nbecause American wartime demand for airplane\nlumber exceeded supplies in Oregon and\nWashington, which had been depleted during World\nWar I. To capture this opportunity, Heintzleman\nsought the advice of timber-industry executives in\npresenting his case for what became the Alaska\nSpruce Log Program (ASLP). Created as an agency\nin 1942, ASLP supplied mills in the continental\nUnited States with high-grade Sitka spruce logs\nfrom the Tongass. At the time, Tongass logging\noccurred primarily by hand-felling the best trees in\naccessible sites, such as beach fringes and river\nbottoms. However, the collective opinion of\nTongass managers, many of whom were\nprofessionally trained foresters, was that clearcutting\nwas a far superior method (Rakestraw 1989).\nTaylor\u2019s (1935) Ecology article provided scientific\njustification for the change from high grading to\nclearcutting in the Alaskan rainforest. With this\njustification, Tongass managers shifted the\nsilvicultural prescription to clearcutting and sought\nto demonstrate the economic viability of harvesting\nthe low-grade timber that comprised the majority of\nthe Tongass timber base.\n\nIn the 18 months of ASLP operation, the program\nexported 38.5 million board feet (MBF) of high-\ngrade spruce to continental U.S. mills, and\ntransferred 46 MBF of lower (utility) grade material\nto local Alaska mills. The ASLP-legislated target\nwas 100 MBF/year of high-grade Sitka spruce, with\nno mention of low-grade materials whatsoever.\nAlthough short lived, the wartime program\ndemonstrated the commercial viability of both\nsawtimber and utility-grade materials from the\nTongass. It also forged strong relationships among\nTongass officials, national policy makers, and\ntimber-industry representatives (Rakestraw 1989).\n\nIn summary, the organization [\u03b1] phase consisted\nof a series of events that initiated adaptive cycles\nsimultaneously in the institutional, policy, and\neconomic subsystems. These adaptive cycles in the\nsubsystems defined the future configuration of the\nTongass system and prepared it for transformation\n(Appendix 2). Key actors in these subsystems\nworked together to shape a common vision of\nindustrial forestry in Alaska (i.e., built the horizontal\nlinks among subsystems), which they viewed as\n\nboth the best path to economic growth and self-\nsufficiency and the best practice for using and\nmanaging the region\u2019s abundant forest resources.\n\nGrowth Phase [r] 1947\u20131975\n\nThe passage of the Tongass Timber Act (TTA) in\n1947 was a landmark event in forest governance that\nmoved the Tongass system into the growth [r] phase.\nWith the TTA, Tongass officials applied a federally\nmandated blueprint to mobilize the resources and\nexpertise required to make industrial forestry a\nreality in Alaska\u2014analogous to the rapid biomass\naccumulation and altered competitive balance\namong species in an early successional forest. In the\nTongass, this involved development of a trained\nworkforce and infrastructure; long-term timber\nleases that altered the relationship between forest\nmanagers and forest users; and increased production\nof forest products (Fig. 2). By authorizing long-term\nguaranteed contracts, favorable scaling and pricing\nrules, and several other subsidies, the TTA provided\nthe impetus needed to overcome economic\nthresholds and transform to a new state of industrial\nforestry.\n\nThe provisions of the TTA were framed by\nlegislators, Tongass officials, and timber-industry\nexecutives. The latter two groups of actors had\nnegotiated terms of lease contracts before the\nlegislation\u2019s passage (Rakestraw 1989). Other\ninterests, including other federal agencies with\nstakes in Alaska land management, were summarily\nexcluded from negotiations, and the bill received\nlittle debate in Congress. The preparation and\npassage of the TTA galvanized the close links\namong agency, legislative, and private-industry\nactors (Rakestraw 1989, Nie 2006), forming a\n\u201cpolicy monopoly\u201d (Baumgartner and Jones 1993,\nKingdon 1995, True et al. 1999) of the Tongass\nsystem, which achieved unprecedented measures to\nfoster industrial-scale forestry, including long-term\nleases that guaranteed non-competitive access to\nmillions of acres of publicly owned forest land.\nLease holders were required to operate pulp mills\nin the region and, in return, received low-interest\nloans, a favorable log-scaling system, and refunds\nof road-building costs (Soderberg and DuRette\n1988). Harvest units in leases were planned largely\nby company foresters and then released to lease\nholders on demand (without open bidding) by the\nTongass. The U.S. Forest Service planning process\nat this time was relatively unfettered by legislative\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\ncomplications, public participation, or judicial\ndecisions (Nie 2006). As a result, there was a low\ndegree of transparency and a high degree of internal\ncontrol in the execution of the long-term timber\ncontracts; such traits are characteristic of industries\noperating on public resources through a policy\nmonopoly (Repetto 1988).\n\nEarly in this period, the Tongass system mobilized\nrapidly in the direction prescribed and supported by\nits policy monopoly. Immediately after the TTA,\nthe U.S. Forest Service and the newly formed\nKetchikan Pulp Company (KPC) agreed to\npreliminary terms of a lease contract. The KPC\ncontract was finalized in 1951 and guaranteed over\n8.5 billion board feet of timber over 50 years, subject\nto 5-year reviews by the U.S. Forest Service; the\nKPC contract set aside nearly one-fifth of the\nTongass for exclusive bidding rights (Soderberg and\nDuRette 1988). In 1953, the Japanese-owned\nAlaska Pulp Development Co. was incorporated in\nthe United States and signed a 50-year, 4.5 billion\nboard foot contract requiring construction of a large\nsawmill and pulp mill in Sitka. By 1959, the Alaska\nPulp Company (APC) was in operation in Sitka.\nAnother long-term contract with the Pacific\nNorthwest Timber Co. was finalized with the\nconstruction of large sawmill in Wrangell. Other\nlease offerings included large tracts in some of the\nmost biologically rich areas of the Tongass, e.g.,\none lease included nearly 90% of productive forests\non Admiralty Island, which today exists as a\nkeystone reserve of regional biodiversity (Beier\n2008).\n\nWithin 5 years of passage of the TTA, roughly 14\nbillion board feet of Tongass timber was under\ncontract to lease holders. In 1953, Regional Forester\nHeintzleman retired from the U.S. Forest Service\nand was appointed Territorial Governor of Alaska,\nwhere he continued vigorous pursuit of\nprogressively larger timber leases in the region\n(Rakestraw 1989). The three existing lease contracts\nproduced over 90% of Tongass timber harvested\nduring the 1960s and 1970s. In the early 1970s, the\nsystem\u2019s growth phase reached several milestones:\nmaximum annual harvest from the Tongass (560\nMBF), maximum Alaskan share of U.S. timber\nexports to Japan (42%), and the small town of\nKetchikan became the third-largest producer of\ncellulose pulp in the world.\n\nDuring this period, a series of legislative and judicial\ndecisions (Appendix 3), beginning in 1960 with the\n\nMultiple Use Sustained Yield Act (MUSYA), began\nto erode the discretional authority of the U.S. Forest\nService (LeMaster 1984). These \u201cperturbations\u201d to\nthe Tongass policy subsystem were largely driven\nby the growing influence of the U.S. environmental\nmovement. With the exception of one major lawsuit\n(Sierra Club v Hardin), these events were not\nspecific to the Tongass and did not significantly\ninfluence system behavior, based on harvest trends\n(Fig. 2). However, these events did begin to\nchallenge the Tongass policy monopoly and its\ncontrol over forest governance by establishing new\nrules and venues for debate and decision making.\nFor this reason, these events provide a window into\nhow the Tongass system was stabilized, or\nconserved, in the face of change\u2014these interactions\nare the focus of the following section.\n\nIn summary, during the growth [r] phase, Tongass\ntimber outputs grew rapidly and stabilized at a\nharvest level roughly 20 times greater than during\nthe organization [\u03b1] phase (Fig. 2). This\ntransformation in the Tongass system resulted from\na solidification of the links among the institutional,\npolicy, and economic subsystems, creating a rigid\nsystem that had minimal transparency or links to\nother processes such as the environmental lobby or\nsmall-scale logging companies that had interests in\nTongass governance. The mills in Ketchikan, Sitka,\nand Wrangell prospered, and the regional industry\nsupported an estimated 3500 local jobs and\nnumerous local schools, which benefited from\ndirect transfers of timber-based revenues (Allen et\nal. 1998). At the beginning of the [r] phase,\nlegislation created positive feedbacks in the policy\nsubsystem that triggered implementation of the\nTongass system; and toward its conclusion,\nlegislation created negative feedbacks that\nincreased the rigidity of internal links among all\nsubsystems of the Tongass. During this period, the\neconomic subsystem was driven largely by positive\nfeedbacks fostering continued growth in forest-\nproducts manufacturing (Appendix 2), which\npeaked in 1970. Because of the tight links among\nthe three subsystems, the positive feedbacks in the\npolicy and economic subsystems drove the growth\nof the Tongass system.\n\nConservation phase [K] 1975\u20131990\n\nBefore 1975, the Tongass system and its policy\nmonopoly remained largely unfettered by changes\nin public opinion and federal policy associated with\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nthe environmental movement. In 1975, for the first\ntime, a federal court ruled against the practice of\nclearcut logging in the Tongass. This event moved\nthe Tongass system into a conservation [K] phase\n\u2014a state analogous to the \u201cclimax\u201d stage of a mature\nforest when the dominant canopy trees strongly\ninfluence endogenous conditions and the system is\nlargely resilient to disturbance (Holling and\nGunderson 2002). During this phase, the Tongass\nsystem faced external, converging drivers of change\nin public policy (Nie 2006), institutional\ngovernance (LeMaster 1984), and global markets\n(Crone 2004). The interactions of these drivers with\ncomponents of the Tongass system revealed the\nmechanisms providing stability and resilience, as\nwell as incipient vulnerabilities. The conservation\nphase is aptly named in two senses: it was a period\nof growing influence of environmental (conservation)\nadvocates in Tongass governance; and it was a\nperiod in which the Tongass system was stabilized\n(or conserved) against directional and mostly\nexternal drivers of change. The latter meaning\u2014\nmaintenance of the system status quo\u2014is our focus.\n\nIn lawsuits against the U.S. Forest Service in\nMontana and West Virginia, federal courts ruled\nthat clearcutting in National Forests was in violation\nof the intent and language of the Organic Act of\n1898 (Nie 2006). Immediately afterward,\nenvironmentalists filed suit (Zieske v Butz) to\nprevent further Tongass clearcut logging by KPC\nand won an initial victory. This ruling was the first\ndirect challenge to the legality of an existing\nTongass long-term contract. By contrast, the Sierra\nClub v. Hardin action (1965\u20131971) sought to\nprevent a pending contract by opposing its\nassociated pulp mill on environmental grounds. The\nZieske v Butz decision set a powerful, albeit brief\nprecedent against industrial-scale logging in the\nTongass; if broadly applied, the decision would\nhave forced the U.S. Forest Service to default on the\ntimber contracts upon which the regional industry\ndepended. The Tongass decision, and those that\npreceded it, led to a stalemate that required\nimmediate intervention by the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe National Forest Management Act (NFMA),\ndrafted largely to allow National Forest timber\noperations to resume, prescribed broad reforms to\nthe U.S. Forest Service planning process. Adding\nfurther to complications created by earlier\nlegislation, the NFMA required each National\nForest to complete a comprehensive management\nplan using an interdisciplinary approach with\ngreater opportunities for public participation.\n\nMoreover, the NFMA strongly reiterated the\nmultiple-use concept (of MUSYA), but neither\nprovided specific guidelines for its application, nor\nreduced the agency\u2019s discretion in achieving the\nmultiple-use objective. As a result, legislators left\nNFMA\u2019s intent open to debate and effectively\ntransferred the venue of that debate to federal courts,\nin turn fostering the legal \u201cobstructionism\u201d that has\nbecome the principal source of paralysis in U.S.\nForest Service planning (Nie 2006). With growing\nopposition to the long-term leases, the Tongass\nplanning process became one of the most\ncontentious in the nation (Malmsheimer et al. 2004).\n\nTongass governance was further complicated by the\nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act\n(ANILCA) of 1981, which reserved nearly one-\nthird of Tongass lands as protected areas. As a result,\nthe ANILCA effectively reduced the operable\nTongass timber base (productive forest land), also\nby roughly one-third (Beier 2008). The Tongass was\none of the most contentious issues in the ANILCA\ndebate (Cahn 1982) because of vehement opposition\nby the Tongass policy monopoly and local\nstakeholder groups who viewed land withdrawals\nas a direct threat to regional economic welfare\n(Nelson 2004). In exchange for difficult\ncompromises on wilderness designation in the\nTongass, a number of provisions supporting the\nregional industry and assuring subsidies to lease\nholders were included in the ANILCA (Beier 2008).\nThe most significant Tongass-related provision\nnegotiated into the bill by Senator Ted Stevens\nauthorized at least $40 million annually to support\nthe timber-sale program. With this guaranteed\nfunding, the Tongass was instructed to supply the\nregional industry 4.5 billion board feet of timber\nvolume per decade. This provision had the effect of\nformally redefining the allowable (maximum) sale\nquantity prescribed in the 1979 Forest Plan as the\ntarget harvest quantity. Tongass managers\ninterpreted this as a mandate to harvest 450 MBF\neach year regardless of market demand (Nie 2006),\nin turn creating an additional source of rigidity in\nthe institutional subsystem of the Tongass. The\nfunding also supported low-interest loans for lease\nholders, research for improvement of forest yields\nand processing efficiency, and new markets for\nTongass forest products. The ANILCA also\nexempted the Tongass from federal guidelines\nrequiring removal of non-commercial-grade forests\nfrom the operable timber base. In total, these\nprovisions had the effect of reaffirming timber\nproduction as the \u201cbest use\u201d of all non-reserved\nTongass lands.\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nDuring this period, increased volatility in timber\nexport markets, and the industry response to these\nfluctuations, signaled the shift of the economic\nsubsystem into the [K] phase (Appendix 2). In 1979,\nexport markets for Tongass pulp products\nexperienced a dramatic decline that lasted\nthroughout much of the 1980s, due mostly to shifts\nin global demand and increased competition\n(Rakestraw 1989). Tongass harvests declined\nclosely in parallel with market fluctuations (Fig. 2),\nsuggesting that much of the regional industry was\noperating at or near the margin, despite the\nconsiderable subsidies received by the long-term\nlease holders. Meanwhile, increased competition\nand the growing disparity between Alaskan mills\nand their competitors, in terms of technology and\nefficiency, posed major challenges to the regional\nindustry (Crone 2004).\n\nIn summary, during the conservation [K] phase, the\nTongass system proved resilient to multiple\nperturbations from legal challenges and new\nlegislation that had either a national focus (NFMA,\nEndangered Species Act (ESA), National\nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA)) or an Alaska-\nwide focus (ANILCA), as well as market\nfluctuations driven by global demand and increased\ncompetition. Although federal environmental\nlegislation and subsequent judicial decisions began\nto erode the primacy of U.S. Forest Service\ndiscretion in governance, the Tongass policy\nmonopoly was able to minimize the impact of these\nchanges; and in response to its most direct threat (to\ndate), was able to safeguard its authority in the\nANILCA debate (Beier 2008). Hence the policy\nsubsystem was in a [K] phase because the policy\nmonopoly remained resilient in the face of rapidly\nstrengthening and expanding drivers of change\n(Appendix 2). Resilience in the policy subsystem\nprevented these perturbations from strongly\ndestabilizing either the institutional or the economic\nsubsystems, thus stabilizing the entire Tongass\nsystem. However, this stability arose entirely\nthrough the addition of rigidity to existing links\namong subsystems, setting the stage for collapse of\nthe entire Tongass system, as we describe below.\n\nCollapse Phase [\u2126] 1990\u20132008\n\nPassage of the Tongass Timber Reform Act (TTRA)\ninitiated the collapse [\u2126] phase of Tongass\nmanagement\u2014analogous to the release stage\ntypically initiated by a stand-replacing event, such\n\nas a fire or disease outbreak, that exceeds the\nresilience of the mature forest. Likewise, the\n\u201cmature\u201d Tongass system became rigid and\nmaladaptive in response to a confluence of events\nthat fostered simultaneous collapse dynamics in the\npolicy and economic subsystems. Within 5 years of\nthe passage of the TTRA, Tongass timber\nproduction declined by roughly 85% and stabilized\nat an output level equivalent to the pre-industrial\nproduction level (Fig. 1).\n\nIn a 1983 lawsuit, Reid Bros. Logging v Ketchikan\nPulp Co., the plaintiffs claimed that KPC unfairly\nforced smaller operators out of the industry. The\ncourt ruled that KPC had engaged in illegal\nconspiracy and anti-competitive practices, and in\nsubsequent lawsuits, ruled that KPC and APC had\ncolluded to marginalize the smaller timber\ncompanies (Durbin 1999). These rulings did not\nimmediately affect the long-term leases, but\ncertainly contributed to the legislative rebuke of the\nlease structures codified several years later in the\nTTRA (Nie 2006).\n\nIn a strong rebuke of the legitimacy of the long-term\nleases, the TTRA essentially dismantled the\nTongass policy monopoly, which in turn drove the\npolicy subsystem to collapse. First and foremost,\nthe TTRA repealed the minimum annual harvest\nmandate and associated subsidies that were won by\nTongass advocates in the ANILCA debate and\ninstead instructed managers to \u201cprovide for the\nmultiple use and sustained yield of all renewable\nforest resources,\u201d to \u201cseek to provide a supply of\ntimber\u201d according to market demand, and to\n\u201cpromote fair competition\u201d in the regional industry\n[emphasis added]. The law modified the lease\ncontracts by eliminating bidding preferences,\npurchaser road credits, and pricing advantages\ngiven to lease holders. The TTRA also created\nTongass-wide stream buffers to protect local\nfisheries, which removed some of most productive\n(and valuable) remaining Tongass stands from\npotential harvest (Nie 2006). As interpreted by the\n9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the TTRA\ninstructed that Tongass management was to be\nguided by \u201cnot an inflexible harvest level, but a\nbalancing of the market, the law, and other uses,\nincluding preservation\u201d [emphasis added].\n\nIn the economic subsystem, investors and industry\nexecutives viewed the TTRA as a sign that Tongass-\nbased operations would no longer be predictable or\nprofitable (Nie 2006). A number of other indicators,\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nmostly related to market volatility and aging mill\ninfrastructure, also pointed to industry collapse.\nFirst, the APC contract depended on the sustained\nlevels of high Japanese demand for Alaskan\nsawtimber and cellulose pulp, even after post-war\nreconstruction had been completed. By 1985, due\nto a decline in pulp markets, the Tongass share of\nU.S. timber exports to Japan dropped to its lowest\npoint (6%) since APC began operations in Sitka.\nSecond, by the 1980s, most mill facilities in Alaska\nlagged far behind regional and global competitors\nin terms of efficiency and technology. Yet because\nof the age and capital amortization of most mills in\nthe region, decisions about both production levels\nand mill improvements were largely driven by\nshort-term profitability. Coupled with the high\noperating costs in southeastern Alaska, poor\nmarkets triggered sporadic mill closures and re-\nopenings throughout the 1980s and 1990s (Morse\n2000). Between 1984 and 1987, all of the major\nmills in the region\u2014except those owned by KPC\nand APC\u2014closed for at least a 3-year period, and\ntwo of these mills never reopened (Brackley et al.\n2006). This volatile economic environment, in\nconcert with growing political uncertainty, strongly\ndiscouraged further investment in mill operations\nor improvements.\n\nSoon after the TTRA, Alaskan export markets\nexperienced another cyclical downturn similar to\nthat of the 1980s, although of lesser magnitude in\nterms of price deflation (Crone 2004). This time,\nhowever, lease holders decided to close the major\npulp mills in Sitka (in 1994) and Ketchikan (in\n1997). These mill closures violated the terms of the\nlease contracts, which were subsequently\nterminated by the U.S. Forest Service, prompting a\nround of lawsuits by the lease holders; APC lost\ntheir case, and KPC settled for $140 million.\n\nIn the institutional subsystem, the TTRA ushered in\nan era in which Tongass decision making effectively\nshifted to judicial and political venues outside of the\nagency (Nie 2006). A recent study estimated that\nfrom 1997\u20132003, 88% of NEPA-required\nenvironmental impact statement (EIS) decisions\nwere appealed on the Tongass; of these, nearly all\nconcerned timber sales, road permits, and other\nrelated development activities (U.S. Department of\nAgriculture (USDA) Forest Service 2004). The\naccumulation of several decades of environmental\npolicies and planning statutes concerning the U.S.\nForest Service fostered an environment where \u201cthe\nthreat of judicial review, injunction, remand, and\n\nthe like cast a very long shadow on agency decision\nmaking\u201d (Nie 2006). Two events immediately\nfollowing the TTRA created further uncertainty in\nthe Tongass administration: first, a 1991\nmoratorium on National Forest logging in Oregon\nand Washington was enacted in response to the\nnorthern spotted-owl (Strix occidentalis caurina)\ncontroversy and the ESA (Trosper 2003); second,\nthe election of President Clinton (1992) caused\nmajor political shifts in the U.S. Forest Service,\nsymbolized most clearly by the appointment of\nwildlife biologist Jack Ward Thomas as agency\nchief, the first non-forester in agency history to hold\nthat position (Steen 2004).\n\nDuring this turbulent period, the Forest Service was\nin the process of revising the 1979 Tongass Forest\nPlan, as required by NFMA. Because the TTRA was\nenacted 3 years into the Forest Plan revision process,\nthe law required Tongass officials to \u201cgo back to the\ndrawing board,\u201d which eventually resulted in a\ndecade-long, $13 million planning effort (Nie\n2006). In many ways, this planning process and its\npriorities suggested a new direction for Tongass\ngovernance, as the new Forest Plan and the process\nof its development were starkly different from its\npredecessor. The 1997 Tongass Land Management\nPlan (TLMP) incorporated the principles of\necosystem management, species conservation, and\nold-growth forest reserves, and designated roughly\n36% of the Tongass in a land-use category of\n\u201cNatural Setting,\u201d where minimal timber harvesting\nand road construction is allowed. In doing so, the\n1997 TLMP reduced the operable Tongass timber\nbase and maximum allowable annual sale quantity\nby nearly half. Including the reserves created by the\nANILCA in 1980, the 1997 TLMP left 28% of the\nTongass land base for timber production. By\ncontrast, roughly 95% of productive forest lands\nwere scheduled for harvest when Congress passed\nthe Tongass Timber Act in 1947. Clearly, the\nTongass had reorganized its institutional priorities,\nas forced primarily by \u201cnew\u201d factors, namely\ndecades of policy reforms and political shifts related\nto public opinion against clearcutting (Bliss 2000).\n\nDespite new factors shaping the Tongass system,\nthis period has been consistently influenced by\npowerful remnants of the erstwhile policy\nmonopoly. Although the Alaska congressional\ndelegation unsuccessfully obstructed the passage of\nthe TTRA and strongly opposed the conservation\ndirectives of the 1997 TLMP, they effectively used\nlegislative committee positions and seniority to\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nexert their influence through budget \u201criders\u201d\u2014\nadditions to bills unrelated to their intent\u2014and other\ninstruments, some of which have been adversarial\nin nature. For example, in exchange for allowing\nthe TLMP planning process to proceed with\nadditional conservation areas and reduced emphasis\non timber operations, Senator Stevens appropriated\n$110 million of \u201cTongass Disaster Relief Funds\u201d\nfrom the federal budget, yielding individual payouts\nranging from $30 000 to $100 000 per lost job\n(Whitney 1996). Senator Stevens and the Alaska\ndelegation also used, with varying levels of success,\nnumerous riders to influence Tongass governance,\nincluding: a separate annual payment of\napproximately $30 million in \u201crelief funds\u201d to the\ncity of Ketchikan; a 1995 provision that would have\nstrictly limited the discretion of Tongass managers\nto set new logging limits and conduct NEPA-\nrequired environmental research; and a 1998\nprovision that would have instructed the Tongass to\nprepare exactly 253 MBF for sale the following\nyear. This last provision, which was removed from\nthe budget before passage, outlined specific legal\nand fiscal consequences if Tongass managers did\nnot fully comply. As of 2008, these \u201cappropriation\npolitics\u201d have remained the dominant way the\nTongass is governed by the Congress (Nie 2006).\n\nIn summary, the collapse [\u2126] phase was initiated by\ndramatic and Tongass-focused policy changes\n(TTRA) that effectively dismantled the Tongass\npolicy monopoly and thus irreversibly transformed\nthe policy subsystem. Closure of the pulp mills in\nSitka and Ketchikan, triggered largely by fiscal\nconcerns arising from both loss of lease subsidies\nand market volatility, forced action in the\ninstitutional subsystem to terminate the long-term\nlease contracts. As the glue that held the entire\ngovernance system together\u2014i.e., coupling the\ninstitutional, economic, and policy subsytems of the\nTongass into a rigid configuration\u2014the dissolution\nof lease contracts had catastrophic consequences.\nRigidity in the system, created initially to promote\ngrowth but increased over time as a mechanism to\nresist external changes, precluded any efforts to\nadapt or transform. Since collapse, Tongass\ngovernance has been largely incapable of\nreorganization.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe preceding narrative suggests the importance of\nchanges in federal policy and larger-scale economic\nfactors as the key drivers of adaptive-cycle\ndynamics in Tongass governance. Policy mobilized\nmuch of the initial growth, provided much of the\nstability during the conservation phase, and served\nto destabilize\u2014at first incrementally and then rather\nsuddenly\u2014the industrial forestry regime of the\nTongass. The changing economic context dictated\nthe timing of policy implementation (growth phase)\nand eroded the resilience of the Tongass system\nduring its collapse. We found that, in both the\ninitiation and collapse of the Tongass system,\ntransformative change occurred only when the\nadaptive cycles of two or more subsystems were in\ncoherence\u2014in other words, when some synergy\nexisted in economic, political, and institutional\ncomponents. Our observation that policy drivers\nresulted in brief, dramatic changes (or \u201clurches\u201d)\ninterspersed with long periods of relative stability,\nis consistent with punctuated equilibrium theories\nof policy making (True et al. 1999). As observed in\nother forest-governance systems (Baskerville\n1995), this suggests that non-linear shifts in policy\ncan drive similar dynamics in larger-scale\ngovernance systems involving ecological, economic,\nand institutional components and controls (Holling\net al. 2002b).\n\nWe can trace the importance of the policy monopoly\nthroughout the Tongass adaptive cycle. In the \u201cfore-\nloop\u201d of growth [r] and conservation [K], the policy\nmonopoly fostered change by creating the long-term\nleases and subsequently provided stability to the\nsystem against external perturbations. Growth was\nfostered by policies that created incentives for local\ninvestment to capture the market opportunities\nemerging from post-World War II reconstruction.\nThese horizontal links between the policy and\neconomic subsystems fostered resilience. Stability\nwas also fostered in the institutional subsystem by\nmaintaining exclusive control over venues of\ndecision making and planning, by ensuring lease\nholder subsidies, and by influencing policy making\nat various scales as it pertained to the Tongass.\nOverall, by maintaining the legitimacy of the long-\nterm leases, the policy monopoly conserved the\nentire system\u2019s stability. Over time, however, this\nmonopoly was eroded as the feedbacks of\nenvironmental and regulatory reforms accumulated\nin both the institutional and policy subsystems.\nThese reforms reflected broader changes in public\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nopinion (Bliss 2000) associated with the\nenvironmental movement at scales larger than the\nTongass and were specifically provoked by\nmanagement outcomes and legal actions in other\nNational Forests (Trosper 2003). As these cross-\nscale feedbacks (panarchy) drove collapse in the\npolicy subsystem, the Tongass system lost its\nresilience to market-oriented perturbations and\nexperienced a precipitous decline in output\u2014\ninitiating dynamics of collapse [\u2126] and providing\nopportunities for potential reorganization [\u03b1] that\nhave not yet been realized.\n\nEvidence of this policy-supported resilience can be\nfound by comparing system dynamics (annual\nharvest outputs) during two periods of price\ndepression in Alaskan export markets: (1) during\nthe 1980s while the long-term lease subsidies were\nin place and (2) during the 1990s after the TTRA\neliminated lease subsidies. During the first severe\nprice depression faced by the Tongass-based\nindustry, although the long-term leases and\nsubsidies were considered safe, market volatility\nresulted in similar fluctuations in harvest output.\nWhen market prices recovered and stabilized,\nharvests rebounded to previous levels (Fig. 2). In\nother words, when the policy subsystem was\nresilient, it afforded resilience to the economic\nsubsystem by assuring investor confidence in the\nlong-term leases and future profit potential (Nie\n2006). In contrast, when a second, but less severe,\nmarket downturn occurred in the early 1990s (Crone\n2004), the entire system collapsed, triggered by\nclosure of the regional pulp mills and the subsequent\ntermination of both lease contracts. We suggest the\nprincipal difference was the state of the policy\nsubsystem, which had entered a collapse [\u2126] phase\n(upon passage of the TTRA) before the second\nmarket downturn. Therefore, by reducing investor\nconfidence in a stable timber supply from the\nTongass (Nie 2006) in addition to eliminating\nsubsidies, the TTRA destabilized the economic\nsubsystem, making it much less resilient to market\nvolatility.\n\nLastly, our case study illustrated the importance of\nscale mismatches and cross-scale interactions in the\nSES. Because of a relatively short observation\nperiod, the apparent lack of negative impacts of\neven-aged management practices in Alaska led\nmanagers to falsely conclude that ecological\nresponses to logging practices were benign, if not\nfavorable. In fact, the short-term feedbacks at the\nlocal scale were almost entirely positive, both in\n\nterms of societal benefits and reinforcing scientific\nassumptions about forest responses to clearcutting\n(Rakestraw 1989). Today, however, recognition of\nthe lagged ecological costs of forest harvest in\nAlaska (Beier et al. 2008) has prompted urgent\nefforts to sustain subsistence and commercial\nresources while managing second-growth forests.\nOf course, this mismatch in temporal scales (i.e.,\necological processes vs. human observation) was\napparent in the longer-term outcomes from similar\nforest management in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.\nEnvironmental advocates who perceived the\ndegradation of these National Forests resulting from\nsimilar industrial practices (Trosper 2003) feared a\nsimilar fate for the Tongass in Alaska (Durbin\n1999). Their dramatic influence on National Forest\ngovernance in the late 20th century acted across\nscales to end industrial logging in the Tongass. This\nsuggests that ecological feedbacks from other\nregions, through processes fostered by a democratic\nsociety, act to drive transformative change in\ngovernance.\n\nHolling\u2019s Pathology and the Tongass Rigidity\nTrap\n\nIn many ways the Tongass case epitomizes the\n&quot;pathology of resource management&quot; described by\nHolling et al. (2002a: 6):\n\nNew policies and development usually\nsucceed initially, but they lead to agencies\nthat gradually become rigid and myopic,\neconomic sectors that become slavishly\ndependent...and a public that loses trust in\ngovernance.\n\nFor the Tongass, an initial period of rapid growth\ngave way to a period in which Holling&#x27;s pathology\nbecame obvious. Forest managers became bound to\nthe rigid requirements of the long-term contracts\nregardless of dramatic changes in their political and\neconomic landscape. As this landscape shifted,\nTongass governance remained rigidly focused on\nexecuting lease contracts and sustaining the regional\nindustry. The fate of the industry and its dependent\ncommunities hinged on lease holder subsidies that\nsought to ensure the local manufacture of forest\nproducts would continue in conjunction with\nfavorable export markets. In addition to\nemployment and infrastructure development\nprovided by the forest-products economy, many\nremote southeastern Alaska communities relied\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nheavily on U.S. Forest Service timber receipts for\npublic-school funding (Allen et al. 1998). Not\nunique to the Tongass, this \u201cslavish dependence\u201d of\nagency, economy, and community has been a\ncharacteristic outcome of U.S. National Forest\ntimber programs (Repetto 1988), especially in the\nPacific Northwest (Trosper 2003).\n\nThe Tongass adaptive cycle illustrates how\n\u201ccommand-and-control\u201d management (Holling and\nMeffe 1996)\u2014the attempt to control system\nvariability, and the assumption that outcomes would\nbe static and predictable\u2014may emerge in the\norganizing principles of a resource system, be\nsuccessful for a period of time, but eventually yield\nto catastrophic failure. Overall, this approach\ncreated intrinsic vulnerabilities that were largely\nmasked during the boom years of Tongass timber,\nbut have left a multifaceted legacy that includes the\ncurrent political stalemate (Nie 2006), a less\ncompetitive regional industry (Crone 2004,\nBrackley et al. 2006), and concerns about capacity\nof managed forest watersheds to sustain local\nproduction of resources\u2014including timber\u2014\nessential for subsistence and commercial economies\n(Beier et al. 2008). Each of these outcomes points\nto the existence of \u201crigidity traps\u201d preventing\nreorganization of the Tongass system to address\nnew challenges and opportunities (Carpenter and\nBrock 2008).\n\nFirst and foremost, the loss of trust in governance\nis probably the only shared perspective among the\nenvironmental advocates, industry representatives,\nlegislators, and local residents who engage in\ncontinuous conflict over the Tongass. Although the\nTongass situation is not unique in the National\nForest system, its importance as an icon of the global\nenvironmental movement (Durbin 1999) has raised\nthe stakes considerably. In the current state, Tongass\nmanagers are pitted between environmental\nadvocacy groups (via litigation and appeals) and\npro-timber legislators and executive officials (via\nbudgets and national leadership). This situation acts\nto maintain day-to-day Tongass decision making in\na highly stable but inflexible state that constrains\nmanagers from responding adaptively to changing\nconditions and, ultimately, from finding a\nsustainable direction for the future governance of\nthe Tongass. As long as the dominant venues of\nstakeholder input in Tongass decision making are\nadversarial\u2014i.e., through appeals and litigation\u2014\nthe institutional subsystem will remain \u201ctrapped\u201d in\nthe collapse [\u2126] phase.\n\nLikewise, the Tongass timber leases left a difficult\nlegacy for the economic subsystem, in terms of the\nlocal capacity to profitably manufacture forest\nproducts. Because the lease contracts were linked\nwith the pulp mills, when the mills closed and the\nleases were terminated, the industry lost its capacity\nto process the low-grade materials that comprise\nmuch of the Tongass timber base. Despite\nimproving markets in recent years, local industry\nproduction has remained near historical lows,\nindicating that the industry has lost much of the\nflexibility that was apparent during the market\ndownturns of the 1980s (Brackley et al. 2006). One\nexplanation for this outcome is the decline of local\nmill infrastructure; in terms of technology and\nefficiency, most regional mills have remained\nlargely unimproved since the 1980s (if not earlier).\nIndustry analysts suggest that improvements in local\nmills are needed to compete in global markets\n(Crone 2004). Yet with a high degree of uncertainty\nthat future timber sales will survive appeals and\nlitigation (U.S. Forest Service 2004), any\nsubstantial investments in local mills is unlikely in\nthe near term (Nie 2006). This uncertainty, in\nconcert with structural changes in the regional\nindustry, maintains the economic subsystem in a\nrigidity trap that will be difficult to escape.\n\nLastly, the yielding of Forest Service control over\nharvesting schedules to timber companies led to the\n\u201clandscape-scale high grading\u201d of the Tongass, in\nwhich lease holders targeted the most productive\nforests to maximize profits (Durbin 1999).\nAlthough precise data are not available, based on\nbiophysical models and historical harvest maps, it\nis estimated that less than one-third of the most\nproductive \u201cbig-tree\u201d rainforests in the entire\nTongass remain unharvested (C. Beier, unpublished\ndata). Nearly all of these remaining big-tree forests\nare either protected by federal legislation (such as\nthe ANILCA) or reserved from logging in the old-\ngrowth networks of the 1997 Forest Plan. As a result,\nthe most productive stands in the current timber base\nof the Tongass are many decades from being\nharvestable, which further constrains opportunities\nfor reorganization.\n\nEscaping the Legacy of Social Traps\n\nRecent developments suggest a potential pathway\nout of these rigidity traps and reorganization toward\nmore sustainable governance of the Tongass.

These offers involve up to 50 000\nboard feet per sale, which may equate to as few as\n10 individual trees; in contrast, standard clearcut\nharvest units typically range into several millions\nof board feet across hundreds of acres. With\nmicrosales, trees are harvested using selection\nlogging and aerial yarding methods that have\nminimal ecological impact compared with the large\nclearcut harvests of the past five decades. Tongass\nmicrosales also meet local demand and provide\nopportunities for value-added manufacturing, and\nperhaps most importantly, all sales have involved\ncompetitive bidding and none have been challenged\nin court. Further advancements in cooperation and\nbuilding trust among stakeholders are also evident.\nIn 2006, the Tongass entered into its first-ever\ninstitutional partnership with an environmental\norganization\u2014The Nature Conservancy of Alaska\n\u2014to support community-based management of\nsecond-growth forests for improving wildlife\nhabitat, future timber values, and several other\necosystem services. Both programs suggest an\ninstitutional change that may allow adaptation to\nnew conditions while allowing forest managers to\ncontinue to produce economic benefits for local\ncommunities, in part through timber production. At\nthe same time, globalization and changes in national\nand global values have altered the economic context\n(e.g., through expanded ecotourism; Colt et al.\n2006) and provided new ways in which the Tongass\ncan provide valuable ecosystem services to society.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND BROADER\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nGovernance of the Tongass National Forest began\nas a large-scale social experiment to bring manifest\ndestiny into the 20th century. The vision was to spur\nregional development and solidify political\ninfluence over the resource-rich Alaskan territory\nthat had been acquired by the U.S. only a few\ndecades previously. The social goal was to create\nsustainable livelihoods for local residents and\ndemonstrate the economic self-sufficiency needed\nto justify Alaskan statehood. Today, a century later,\nthe emergence of large-scale forestry, agricultural,\nand hydroelectric projects in developing nations has\na strikingly familiar tone, although now framed in\na different paradigm. These governance systems are\noften centrally designed and funded to achieve\n\npolitical, social, and economic goals, and are\nimplemented in ways that buffer against economic\nand political uncertainties so as to ensure success.\nYet our case study of the Tongass, like many others\n(Gunderson et al. 1995), suggests this \u201ccommand-\nand-control\u201d approach is bound to failure (Holling\nand Meffe 1996). How can our application of the\nadaptive-cycle diagnostic to the Tongass case help\nguide a more adaptive and sustainable governance\nof resources to achieve broad societal goals?\n\nOur case study warns against formation of a policy\nmonopoly\u2014of government funders, agency\nmanagers, and resource users\u2014for rigidly buffering\na governance system against change. This \u201ciron\ntriangle\u201d (Kingdon 1995) made the Tongass\nefficient in producing timber and supporting local\neconomic growth during its boom years, but became\nincreasingly rigid and prevented adaptation to\nchanging social preferences as well as shifting\neconomic and ecological realities. This rigidity\ncontributed to the rapid, catastrophic nature of\nsystem collapse and its persistent legacy in the\nregion. Since collapse, remnants of this policy\nmonopoly have continued to constrain institutional\nadaptive capacity\u2014over a decade since closure of\nthe last pulp mill in Alaska, most timber sales\noffered by Tongass managers are for pulp-grade\ntimber (Beier 2007), few of which are ever harvested\nin the face of vigorous legal challenges. After\ndecades of contentious debate among politicians,\nmanagers, and resource users, these actors have\nheretofore been reluctant to reach any consensus on\nalternative visions for the future of the Tongass.\n\nThe Tongass case also affirms that when agencies\ncharged with management of common property\nresources yield too much authority to narrowly\nfocused private interests, even in the pursuit of\nimproving human well-being, the public welfare\nsuffers in the long run (Ostrom 1990). Such rent-\nseeking behavior has been a common symptom\namong large-scale forest governance systems\naround the world (Repetto and Gills 1998, Ross\n2001). Our case study illustrates how boundaries\ncan be distorted between the governance of a SES\nand the management of a specific resource, and how\nnegative outcomes can emerge and persist,\nregardless of the initial purpose of managers and\ndecision makers. In other words, when governance\nbecomes too driven by a singular management\nemphasis that is rigidly organized, even the best-\nlaid plans will likely fail.\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nLastly, our case study suggests that efforts to resist\nsocial and ecological change will ultimately fail,\nand attempts to stabilize the system through rigidity\nwill constrain future adaptive capacity. The Tongass\nsystem was designed to minimize SES change in\nresponse to external perturbations and constrain\nvariability in every possible dimension: (1) political\nvariability was minimized through a policy\nmonopoly that established and safeguarded the\nlong-term lease contracts and associated subsidies;\n(2) economic variability was buffered through\nsubsidies and incentives designed to overcome local\neconomic challenges and constrain the impact of\nglobal markets on local profitability; (3) ecological\nvariability, specifically the structural heterogeneity\nof the future forest, was constrained through even-\naged management practices; and (4) institutional\nvariability, such as the growing emphasis on\nenvironmental research to understand impacts of\nmanagement activities, was suppressed through\n\u201cappropriation politics\u201d and similar measures. In\neach of these subsystems, this rigidity has resulted\nin social traps that act in concert to inhibit the\nadaptive renewal of Tongass governance, and to\nsome extent, the larger regional SES.\n\nOverall, this legacy has interrupted the Tongass\nadaptive cycle because the system has been unable\nto reorganize for renewal in the new post-collapse\ncontext. We suggest this has occurred because the\nTongass system emphasized the control of\nvariability and prevented the gradual adaptation to\nchanging social and economic conditions. An\nanalogy between a democratic society and a forest\necosystem helps illustrate this point; in both, release\nand renewal\u2014e.g., through regular elections or\nforest fires\u2014need to occur regularly. Suppressing\ninherent variability prevents these dynamics\n(Holling et al. 2002b). In such cases, if the system\nis prevented from going through these cycles\u2014for\nexample, through policy monopoly or fire\nsuppression practices\u2014then when collapse does\noccur, it is typically catastrophic, with a difficult\nlegacy that impedes renewal. In both cases, the\naftermath suggests the difference between\n\u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cpathological\u201d dynamics of an\nadaptive cycle; when pathological, the system\nremains trapped in the collapse [\u2126] phase far longer.\nFor the Tongass, as of 2009, this prolonged collapse\nhas lasted almost two decades.\n\nReorganization of the Tongass into a more\nsustainable system ultimately depends on\nreconciliation among local and national stakeholders,\n\ntheir advocates, and the agency that manages their\ninterests for the common benefit. In a study of\nsimilar deadlock in forest governance in New\nBrunswick, Canada, Baskerville (1995) showed\nhow abrupt changes in forest policy can foster such\na reconciliation, and in turn, transformation of\ngovernance toward a sustainable balance of forest\nvalues. In Alaska, several promising trends\u2014\nimproving market conditions, a growing emphasis\non managing second-growth for future values, new\npartnerships with conservation organizations, and\nnew political leadership at the state and national\nlevels\u2014suggest the critical opportunity for Tongass\nrenewal is now.\n\nResponses to this article can be read online at:\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/responses/\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nWe are grateful to A.

It traces the historical interplay of political, institutional, and economic factors that led to cycles of expansion and decline in forest management. The study highlights how federal policies, combined with global market changes, significantly influenced the governance and management practices in Tongass, eventually leading to an industrial collapse.\n\n### Key Ideas\n\n1. **Adaptive Cycle Application**: The study applies the adaptive cycle to understand the phases of growth, conservation, and collapse in the management of Tongass, emphasizing the influence of external economic and policy changes.\n\n2. **Policy and Economic Drivers**: It identifies federal policies and global market dynamics as critical drivers that shaped the governance outcomes, pointing out how policy alignments and economic conditions can precipitate systemic changes.\n\n3. **Resilience and Vulnerability**: The analysis discusses the system&#x27;s resilience provided by long-term lease contracts and how increasing rigidity contributed to its vulnerability and eventual collapse.\n\n### Relevance to Sustainable Resource Management\n\nThe findings are highly relevant to sustainable resource management, illustrating the importance of flexibility and adaptability in policy frameworks. The Tongass case study serves as a cautionary tale of how rigid policies, coupled with failure to adapt to changing economic conditions, can lead to severe resource management failures. The insights suggest that sustainable governance should incorporate adaptive management practices that can respond dynamically to ecological, economic, and social changes, promoting resilience and avoiding rigidity traps that lead to systemic collapses. This approach is crucial for managing common property resources effectively and sustainably, avoiding the pitfalls seen in the Tongass National Forest management."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

However, several barriers can hinder adaptability in organizations, systems, and individuals:\n\n1. **Organizational Structure**: Rigid, hierarchical organizational structures can slow decision-making processes and inhibit the ability to respond swiftly to changing circumstances. Such structures often lack the flexibility needed to adapt to new challenges or opportunities.\n\n2. **Cultural Resistance**: Cultural norms and values that emphasize tradition over innovation can create resistance to change. In some organizations or communities, there may be a deep-rooted preference for maintaining the status quo, which can prevent the adoption of new and potentially beneficial practices.\n\n3. **Lack of Resources**: Limited financial, human, or technological resources can constrain adaptability. For example, a lack of investment in training and development can prevent employees from acquiring new skills necessary for adapting to changes in the marketplace.\n\n4. **Inadequate Information Systems**: In the absence of robust information systems, organizations might not effectively collect or analyze data essential for making informed decisions. This can lead to delays in recognizing shifts in the environment or in responding appropriately.\n\n5. **Short-term Focus**: Focusing too heavily on short-term results can deter long-term planning and investment in adaptability. This might include neglecting to develop strategies that ensure sustainability and resilience in the face of future challenges.\n\n6. **Psychological Barriers**: Fear of failure and uncertainty can discourage individuals and organizations from taking the risks associated with adapting to change. This can lead to a lack of innovation and experimentation, which are often necessary for successful adaptation.\n\n7. **Poor Leadership**: Leadership plays a crucial role in promoting or hindering adaptability. Leaders who are not committed to fostering a culture of learning and resilience may fail to encourage their teams to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n8. **Regulatory and Policy Constraints**: In some sectors, especially those heavily regulated by government policies, legal constraints can limit the ability to adapt. Regulations that do not evolve in tandem with technological and social changes can hinder progress and innovation.\n\nOvercoming these barriers often requires a deliberate shift in strategy, culture, and practices to foster an environment that not only accepts change but actively embraces and anticipates it."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to\nshow how individuals achieve results that are &quot;better than rational&quot; by building conditions where reciprocity,\nreputation  and trust can help to overcome the stong temptations of short-nun self-interest. The fourth\nsection raises the possibiliry of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops\nan  initial theoretical sc ea rio , and the  final section concludes by examining the implications o f  placing\nreciprocity reputation  and  trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.\n\nwe are hand-waving at  our central questions. I am\nafraid that  we do a lot of hand-waving.\n\net me start with a provocative statement. You\nwould not be reading this article if it were not for\nsome of our ancestors learning how to undertake\n\ncollective action to solve social dilem mas. Successive\ngenerations have added to the stock of everyday knowl-\nedge about how to instill productive norms of behavior\nin their children and to craft rules to support collective\naction that produces public goods and avoids &quot;trage-\ndies of the commons.&quot;I What our ancestors and con-\ntemporaries have learned about engaging in collective\naction for mutual defense,child rearing,and survival is\nnot , however, understood or explained by the extant\ntheory of collective action.\n\nThe lessons of effective collective action are not\nsimple\u2014as is obvious from human history and the\nimmense tragedies that humans have endured ,as  well\nas the successes we have realized. As global relation-\nships become even more intricately intertwined and\ncomplex,however, our survival becomes more depen-\ndent on empirically grounded scientific understanding.\nWe have not yet developed a behavioral theory of\ncollective action based on models of the individual\nconsistent with empirical evidence about how individ-\nuals make decisions in social-dilemma situations. A\nbehavioralcommitment to theory grounded in empir-\nical inquiry is essential if we are to understand such\nbasic questions as why face-to-face communication so\nconsistently enhances cooperation in social dilemmas\nor how structural variables facilitate or impede cffec-\ntive collective action.\n\nSocial dilemmas occur whenever individuals in inter-\ndependent situations face choices in which the maxi-\nmization of short-term self-interest yields outcomes\nleaving all participants worse off than feasible alterna-\ntives. In a public-good dilemma, for example, all those\nwho would benefit from the provision of a public\ngood\u2014such as pollution control, radio broadcasts  or\nweather forecasting\u2014find it costly to contribute and\nwould prefer others to pay for the good instead. If\neveryone follows the equilibrium strategy, then the\ngood is not provided or  is underprovided  Yet, every-\none would be better off if everyone were to contribute.\n\nSocial dilemmas are found in all aspects of life,\nleading to momentous decisions affecting war and\npeace as well as the mundane relationships of keeping\npromises in everyday life.Social dilemmas are called by\nmany names, including the public-good or collective-\ngood problem(Olson 1965, P.  Samuelson 1954),shirk-\ning(Alchian and Demsetz 1972), the free-rider prob-\nlem(Edney 1979,Grossman and Hart 1980),moral\nhazard(Holmstrom 1982),the credible commitment\ndilemma(Williams, Collins, and Lichbach 1997), gen-\neralized social exchange (Ekch 1974; Emerson 1972a,\n\nYet, the theory of collective action is the central\nsubject of political science  It is the core of the justifi-\ncation for the state.

But the problem frame also rests\non a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these\nassumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly\nfrom the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C \u2013 violates these assumptions. Climate\nchange requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such\nprohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The\nmain barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and\ninstitutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more\neffectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.\n\n1. The tragedy of the commons\n\nThe biologist and ethnic nationalist Garrett Hardin wanted society\nto restrict people\u2019s reproductive freedom, and believed that only those\nparents who would raise their children the right way should be entitled\nto have babies [1,2]. To support this politically charged belief, Hardin\ndeveloped an argument based on the idea of the tragedy of the commons,\na game theoretic model involving farmers\u2019 letting their cows graze on\nthe communally owned village green [3]. Every farmer obtains the full\nbenefit of placing an extra cow on the commons to graze, while\nsuffering only a small share of the cost to the community as a whole,\nin terms of less grass being available to the other cows. Overgrazing is\nthe inevitable equilibrium, unless the community as a whole steps in.\nLimiting the number of cows, and ideally allocating them to those\nfarmers who can manage them most profitably, is the obvious solution.\nThe lesson transferred well to the point Hardin was trying to make\nabout people in his now famous article.\n\nToday, few would use a tragedy of the commons framing, or related\nterms such as commons problem, common pool resource problem, or\nexternalities problem, to describe the issue of human population growth.\nThis is largely because the world has witnessed birthrates falling\nglobally, on most continents to below replacement levels, as a result\nof factors Hardin didn\u2019t consider: the education of women, reductions in\ninfant mortality, and urbanization [4,5]. But most analysts do use\nHardin\u2019s idea to describe other environmental problems, most notably\nclimate change, and based on this framing suggest a strategy similar to\n\nwhat Hardin advocated [6]. The framing may be appropriate for some\nof these problems, fisheries management being an example that comes\nto mind. But it is not appropriate for climate change, and the sooner we\nstop framing climate change in this way, the better.\n\nAs a starting point, it is worth considering what the key aspects of a\ncommons problem actually are. Hardin himself described four, and\nthese are as valid today as they were then. First, of course, there needs\nto be a common pool resource, such as the grass on a village green, or\nthe global carrying capacity for people. Second, there needs to be a use\nof that resource, or an activity that depletes it, that is legitimate and\nvaluable, accepted by society at large. In Hardin\u2019s model, we do want\ncows to graze on the village green, as long as they do so productively,\njust as we do want a planet that is home to people. In fact, because the\nuse is so valuable, we want to ensure that it takes place in a manner that\nis both optimal and sustainable. Third, the common-pool nature of the\nresource has to be the thing that leads people to overuse or over-deplete\nthe resource, to the point that is clearly suboptimal, perhaps even\nexceeding its sustainable limits. Fourth, there cannot be a technical\nsolution. By this, Hardin meant that it is not possible to use technology\nto expand the resource in order to continually accommodate the\ngrowing use.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons acts a problem frame. The effect of a\nproblem frame is to take a complex issue \u2013 which affects multiple values\nand can be considered from a variety of perspectives \u2013 and to simplify it\naround one particular conceptualization, leading to one particular\nsolution strategy [7]. In the case of this framing, it is the third aspect\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023\nReceived 16 May 2017; Accepted 18 May 2017\n\nE-mail address: anthony.patt@usys.ethz.ch.\n\nEnergy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\nAvailable online 27 May 2017\n2214-6296/ \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

The common-pool own-\nership structure, meaning that agents do not pay the full cost of their\nuse, is seen as the driving force behind their overuse. Framing a\nproblem as a tragedy of the commons automatically implies that if one\ncould privatize the ownership structure, or make the agents pay the full\ncosts to society of their use of the resource, then an optimal outcome\nwould be achieved. In the case of a village green, the easy solution is to\ndivide it up with fences, and have each subdivided plot belong to a\nsingle farmer. In the case of a resource that cannot be subdivided so\neasily, like the global carrying capacity for humans, then the solution is\nonly slightly more complicated. Either one has to establish a limited\nnumber of rights to use the resource, and allocate these to people in\nadvance, or one has to charge people ex post for their use of the\nresource. An important feature of the model is that the solution\nincreases the resource\u2019s overall productivity. And that means that as\nlong as the allocation mechanism or tax is fair, then reaching an\nagreement to privatize the use rights or internalize their costs should be\npolitically feasible.\n\nBut the usefulness of such policy guidance depends on the under-\nlying applicability of the problem frame. The presence of a common\npool resource does not guarantee that Hardin\u2019s solution strategy is the\nbest; the problem frame ceases to provide useful guidance if any of the\nother three criteria are violated. A case that illustrates failure on the\nsecond of the four criteria is the act of murdering one\u2019s neighbor. This\ndepletes the common pool resource of public safety, but murder is not\nan activity that we want, so we don\u2019t solve it by imposing a tax or\nallocating a limited number of permits. We prohibit it. To illustrate\nfailure on the third criterion, drinking alcohol is a behavior that we\ntolerate in moderation, and even encourage in some situations, but\nwhen people get drunk and start breaking things, they become a public\nnuisance. Yet we don\u2019t believe that internalizing the cost of drunken\nbehavior will get the person on the verge of intoxication to say no to\nanother drink. So we address it by other means, including charging\nbartenders with cutting people off, and providing treatment programs\nfor alcoholism. To illustrate failure on the fourth criterion, the local\npublic school may be overcrowded, but we can solve this by enlarging\nthe building and hiring more teachers. So we do that, rather than\nlimiting the number of places available or imposing high school fees.\nFailure on any of these criteria matters. Climate change fails on all\nthree.\n\n2. Why climate change fails the tragedy of the commons criteria\n\nMany people see the 2015 Paris Agreement as representing a\nturning point in climate governance, but in fact the events that\nforeshadowed Paris occurred a decade prior to then, culminating in\n2007. It was then that the idea of the 2 \u00b0C target gained popularity,\nbased on risk management arguments, and was incorporated into a\nglobal action plan agreed to in Bali, Indonesia, at the closing of a failed\nset of negotiations to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol [8\u201310]. Paris\nbuilt on this decision, and added an additional level of ambition by\nsuggesting the desirability of limiting climate change to 1.5 \u00b0C. More\nimportantly, Paris set up a process that could help countries to take the\nsteps to achieve one or the other, in terms of a regular \u201cglobal stock\ntake,\u201d as well as a set of mechanisms to provide financial and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries.\n\nThe one thing that the Paris Agreement does not include is a set of\nnegotiated binding national targets, of the kind that are the heart of the\nKyoto Protocol. In fact, the failed desire to include such binding targets\nis what led to the eight-year delay, starting in Bali. And yet this failure\nshould not surprise us, for a simple reason. The tragedy of the commons\nframing suggests that negotiating binding targets should be politically\nfeasible, with the main hurdle being the identification of a mutually\nacceptable allocation rule for the net benefits. But this presupposes that\nthe global target is one that will maximize the value to society of\nwhatever activity it is that degrades the common pool resource. Partial\n\ndecarbonization as per Kyoto could take place by eliminating ineffi-\nciencies in the energy system, and arguably could deliver immediate net\neconomic benefits; negotiating the allocation rule took less than two\nyears. Achieving the Paris targets of 2 \u00b0C or 1.5 \u00b0C, however, requires\nthat net anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo-\nsphere cease entirely in the second half of this century [11]. Finding\nimmediate net benefits to allocate that are associated with a complete\nhalting of emissions is more or less impossible, and so negotiating such\nan agreement required convincing people to pay attention to large\nbenefits anticipated in the future, in some cases centuries hence [12,8].\nSo the temperature target qualitatively changed the character of\nnegotiations, making them far more difficult, arguably impossible.\nMore fundamentally, the need to eliminate emissions entirely, essen-\ntially as soon as possible, makes those emissions something that society\nwill no longer tolerate. So climate change fails the second of the four\ncriteria Hardin identified, just like murder.\n\nThere has been another major change since about 2007, and that is\nthe recognition that the medium-term costs of eliminating greenhouse\ngas emissions are likely to be trivial, and may in fact be negative, even\nbefore considering the long-term benefits from avoided climate impacts\n[13,14]. What drove this recognition was the realization from the field\nof evolutionary economics that policies to expand renewable energy\nalso make them cheaper [15,16]. This fact has become especially salient\nlately, as the costs of supplying energy from some renewable resources\nhave fallen to below those of fossil fuels [17], especially if one takes\ninto account local environmental effects such as air pollution or water\ndemand [18]. A study in the United States, for example, examined the\navoided local and regional environmental impacts associated with\ninstalling wind and solar power instead of new coal capacity, and\nfound the value of those impacts to be far larger than the difference in\ncost between the two technologies [19]. As another example, the costs\nto own and drive an electric car charged by wind or solar power are\napproaching parity with those of a conventional gasoline model, at least\nunder some conditions [20].\n\nThese trends suggest two additional ways in which the tragedy of\nthe commons framing fails for climate change. First, there is no longer a\nnecessary misalignment of incentives between the emitters of green-\nhouse gases and society at large. Every country, with the possible\nexception of major oil and gas exporters, has reason to mitigate climate\nchange and transform its national energy sector away from fossil fuels,\nregardless of what other countries may do. Every household will soon\nhave a financial incentive to stop burning oil and gas, regardless of\nwhat their neighbors do. So if fossil fuels are still in business, it will not\nbe because of an unjust cost advantage, born from the existence of an\nexternality. Climate change is like the example of public drunkenness:\ninternalizing the cost will not change anything qualitatively. Second, it\nnow appears that a technical solution does exist for climate change.\nIntegrated assessment models suggest that by switching to non-fossil\nenergy sources, we can continue to see global economic activity grow,\nat roughly the same pace, even as greenhouse gas emissions come to a\nhalt [21]. Climate change is like enlarging the public school.\n\n3. Framing today\u2019s challenge in evolutionary terms\n\nBut we still have a problem needing to be solved. Using electric cars\nas an example, a household may soon have a financial incentive to\nswitch over from their gasoline model, but it will not do so unless there\nis a dense network of charging stations where they want to take long\ntrips. At the same time, there is no business case to install such a\nnetwork as long as the number of electric cars on the road remains low.\nThis is a chicken and egg problem: you need a chicken to get an egg, but\nan egg to get a chicken. Similar problems exist across the energy sector.\nAt the most general level, we need to prohibit greenhouse gas\nemissions, which almost certainly means prohibiting fossil fuels. But\nwhich comes first: prohibition, or clean energy? Before prohibition can\nbe politically and socially feasible, we need a clean energy system that\n\nA. Patt Energy Research &amp; Social Science 34 (2017) 1\u20133\n\n2\n\n\n\nis good enough to sustain us. Yet given more than a century already\nspent improving and optimizing an energy system based on fossil fuels,\nthe first steps towards a clean energy system are necessarily expensive,\nclunky, and unreliable. Most of the improvements to the clean energy\nsystem \u2013 built around new knowledge, networks, and institutions \u2013 only\ncome once we start relying on it. Progress can occur, but without policy\nintervention, it will be slow. It took millions of years to get a chicken\negg when the starting point was a dinosaur. Accelerating evolution is\nthe key challenge for climate policy.\n\nJust as the tragedy of the commons framing offered clear guidance\nin terms of the appropriate policy instruments, so too does an\nevolutionary framing, based on insights from the emerging scientific\nstudy of socio-technical transitions [22]. Our policy instruments need to\nbe those that build the new knowledge, networks, and institutions that\nwill enable a clean energy system to function smoothly and affordably,\nwhich is a prerequisite to phasing out fossil fuels. When we think about\nall of the policies that support renewable energy innovation and\ndeployment \u2013 state-sponsored R &amp;D, tax credits or feed-in tariffs for\nproject developers, and streamlined permitting processes for green\ninfrastructure \u2013 that is exactly what is going on. As they create a new\nsystem that is viable, these policies lay the groundwork for a second\ngeneration of sectoral regulations, already beginning to appear, which\nprevent new investment into fossil fuel infrastructure. If you frame\nclimate change as an evolutionary problem, it is this sequence of policy\ninstruments that makes the most sense [23].\n\nThe issue of how we frame climate change mitigation is important,\nprecisely because the two framings point us in different directions with\nrespect to policy. When there is a true tragedy of the commons, then\nneo-classical economics and game theory provide a solid basis to favor\nmarket-based instruments, those that allocate limited rights to deplete\nthe resource or internalize the costs of doing so [24]. Confusion can\narise, however, because proponents of market-based instruments also\nsuggest that these will provide the needed stimulus for innovation,\npromoting systemic change [25,26]. But just because these instruments\nare the best solution to one kind of problem does not mean they are\nvery good or effective with respect to another. In fact, a growing\nliterature shows that they aren\u2019t, and that the effective policies to\nstimulate a transition are those that directly support the development of\nnew knowledge, networks, and institutions, directly addressing the\nbarriers to systemic change [27]. The choice of how we frame climate\nchange dictates the terms by which we evaluate the relative strengths\nand weaknesses of the different possible solution strategies. Judged by\nthe appropriate criteria, market instruments are generally a poor fit.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons framing made sense at a time when we\nbelieved that people needed to adjust the energy system at the margins,\nand believed that the cost of doing so would be high. We no longer\nbelieve these things. The atmosphere may be a common pool resource,\nbut using it as a place to put our greenhouse gas emissions is no longer\nsomething for which we have any long-term rights to allocate. To\nprohibit dumping our greenhouse gases there, we first need to accel-\nerate a technological transition towards non-fossil sources of energy, for\nwhich the main barriers have to do with knowledge and networks,\nrather than an inherent difference in cost. Policies providing active and\ndirect governmental support for new technologies and technological\nsystems can change the conditions that hold the new technologies back.\nIn fact they have already done a great deal; they have led to a dramatic\ndecline in the costs of key energy technologies, and contributed to the\npossibility that global emissions have already peaked. There is still\nmore work to be done, and we can solve climate change if we build on\nwhat we have learned. At all costs, we should resist the temptation to\nreverse course because the policies don\u2019t fit one man\u2019s convenient story\nof too many cows on a village green.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nFunding for the development of the ideas expressed in this article\n\ncame from European Research Council Starting Grant number 313553.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.

Beier 1,2, Amy Lauren Lovecraft 1, and F. Stuart Chapin, III 1\n\nABSTRACT. Large-scale government efforts to develop resources for societal benefit have often\nexperienced cycles of growth and decline that leave behind difficult social and ecological legacies. To\nunderstand the origins and outcomes of these failures of resource governance, scholars have applied the\nframework of the adaptive cycle. In this study, we used the adaptive cycle as a diagnostic approach to trace\nthe drivers and dynamics of forest governance surrounding a boom\u2013bust sequence of industrial forest\nmanagement in one of the largest-scale resource systems in U.S. history: the Tongass National Forest in\nsoutheastern Alaska. Our application of the adaptive cycle combined a historical narrative tracing dynamics\nin political, institutional, and economic subsystems and a longitudinal analysis of an indicator of overall\nsystem behavior (timber harvests). We found that federal policies in concert with global market changes\ndrove transformative change in both forest governance (policy making) and forest management (practices),\nthrough creation and dissolution of subsidized long-term lease contracts. Evidence of the systemic resilience\nprovided by these leases was found in the analysis of industry responses to market volatility before and\nafter Tongass-specific federal reforms. Although the lease contracts stabilized the Tongass system for a\nperiod of time, they fostered a growing degree of rigidity that contributed to a severe industrial collapse\nand the subsequent emergence of complex social traps. Broader lessons from the Tongass suggest that\nlarge-scale changes occurred only when the nested economic and policy cycles were in coherence, and a\nsystemic effort to minimize social and ecological variability ultimately resulted in catastrophic collapse of\ngovernance. This collapse resulted in a pervasive and challenging legacy that prevents Tongass\nreorganization and limits the adaptive capacity of the larger social\u2013ecological system of southeastern\nAlaska. Although this legacy has inhibited system renewal for two decades, recent trends indicate the\nemergence of new opportunities for progress toward sustainable governance of the Tongass National Forest.\n\nKey Words: adaptive cycle; Alaska; forest management; resource governance; rigidity traps; U.S. National\nForests\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGovernment efforts to stimulate the development of\nnatural resources for public benefit often seek to\nimplement a vision at grand scales that, over time,\ncreates a cycle of dependency that undermines the\noriginal social purpose as well as the resource base\nthat was intended to be sustained. In the United\nStates, this has occurred with respect to agriculture\n(Light et al. 1995), forestry (Repetto 1998, Trosper\n2003), fisheries (Francis and Reiger 1995, Pauly et\nal. 2005), water (Ostrom 1990, Lee 1995), and many\nother types of resource systems (Holling and Meffe\n1996). Similar cycles of dependency have emerged\n\nthrough international aid programs to developing\nnations that were intended to create self-sufficiency\nthrough resource development. Although the goals\nof these programs are often socially admirable and\nprovide an economic stimulus to initiate changes\nthat would otherwise lack the resources to emerge\n\u2014i.e., to escape from poverty traps (Carpenter and\nBrock 2008)\u2014they often result in challenging\nsocial traps (Costanza 1987) that can constrain\noptions for future generations. Why have these\ngovernance efforts failed so consistently, and what\nlessons can be learned that would enlighten efforts\nto address new frontiers of resource governance and\npublic welfare in a rapidly changing world?\n\n1University of Alaska-Fairbanks, 2SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\nmailto:cbeier@esf.edu\nmailto:ffall@uaf.edu\nmailto:terry.chapin@uaf.edu\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nIn this article, we analyze the rise, collapse, and\naftermath of one of the largest resource governance\nprograms in the history of the United States:\nindustrial timber production in the Tongass National\nForest (Tongass) of southeastern Alaska. Although\nlarge-scale industrial forestry emerged as a\nmechanism for stimulating social welfare and\neconomic growth, the Tongass has become one of\nthe most controversial issues of public land\nmanagement in the United States (Wilkinson 1997).\nAs such, its story has been framed in several ways:\nas the central theme in the history and purpose of\nthe U.S. Forest Service in Alaska (Rakestraw 1989);\nas an acute example of political influence,\nmismanagement, and corruption resulting in\nenvironmental degradation (Durbin 1999); as a\ncomplex situation governed by entrenched\ninfluences and acrimonious personal relationships,\nas described by a former agency chief (Steen 2004);\nas a local drama of lost jobs and livelihoods due to\n\u201ceconomic vandalism\u201d by environmentalists\n(Soderberg and DuRette 1988); and as a study of\ncumulative regulatory complications and policy\nreforms resulting in conflicted governance and a\n\u201cdeadlock\u201d among institutions and stakeholder\ngroups (Nie 2006).\n\nAlthough each account yields valuable insights,\nthey present an incomplete and often normative\npicture of the Tongass case and its broader\nimplications for the regional social\u2013ecological\nsystem (SES) of southeastern Alaska; and therefore,\nprovide little guidance on how resource systems\nmight be more effectively governed for long-term\nsustainability and greater public benefit. In this\narticle, we present the first analysis that examines\nthe links among policy, institutions, economies, and\necosystems that shaped the governance of the\nTongass during the 20th century. We apply a\nresilience lens and use the framework of the\nadaptive cycle (Holling and Gunderson 2002) as a\ndiagnostic tool to investigate the nested attributes\nof the Tongass system (Ostrom 2007). Building on\na previous group of adaptive-cycle studies of\nmanagement and governance systems (Gunderson\net al. 1995), we (1) developed an adaptive-cycle\nnarrative of the Tongass coupled with a quantitative\nindicator of system behavior (annual timber\nharvests), (2) traced the adaptive cycles of policy,\ninstitutional, and economic subsystems to identify\nsynergistic feedbacks that drove transformative\nchange at larger scales, and (3) compared adaptive-\ncycle interactions among subsystems to identify\nsources of resilience and vulnerability.\n\nObjectives and Key Questions\n\nIn this case study, we apply the adaptive cycle as\nboth a theoretical framework and a diagnostic\nmethod to reveal the dynamics and interactions of\na resource governance and management system\nnested within a larger SES. We chose the adaptive\ncycle because the Tongass boom\u2013bust cycle typified\nthe \u201cpathology of resource management\u201d (Holling\nand Meffe 1996), characterized by a cyclical pattern\nof dynamics that links ecological (resource) and\nsocial (governance) systems in a higher-order\ncoupled system (SES) (Gunderson et al. 1995,\nHolling et al. 2002b). The adaptive cycle explains\nthe dynamics of a system that is initiated\n(organization [\u03b1]), mobilizes and develops (growth\n[r]), attains a stable configuration (conservation\n[K]), changes to a different structure (collapse [\u2126]),\nand begins the process anew (reorganization [\u03b1]).\nOur focus is on the coupled cycles of change in\ngovernance (through policy and leadership),\nresource management (through practices and\nplanning), and private industry (through processing\nand sale of forest products), and their overall\nimpacts on the southeastern Alaska SES. The\nadaptive-cycle framework supports the systematic\nidentification of key interactions and feedbacks\namong system components that drove system\ndynamics, allowing us to address the following\nquestions:\n\n\u25cf What factors (ecological, economic, cultural,\npolitical) had the greatest overall influence\non stability and change in Tongass\ngovernance and management?\n \n\n\u25cf What aspects of Tongass governance (via\npolicy) and forest management (via practice)\nwere especially vulnerable to drivers of\nchange?\n \n\n\u25cf How did the system stabilize itself against\nexternal perturbation?\n \n\n\u25cf What was the source of this resilience and\nhow was it eventually lost? Was collapse\ntriggered by changes in one or many aspects\nof the system?\n \n\n\u25cf What aspects of the Tongass system resulted\nin the social\u2013ecological legacy that currently\ninhibits renewal toward a more sustainable\nsystem of forest governance?\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n \n\u25cf How does this legacy inhibit progress? How\n\ncan this legacy be overcome to facilitate\nsystem renewal and restore adaptive\ncapacity?\n\nA Systems Framework\n\nWe define the \u201cTongass system\u201d as a coupled\nsystem of governance (the set of structures and\nprocesses by which people make decisions and\nshare power) and management (the set of actions\nthat manipulate a system to achieve desired\noutcomes) nested within in the larger SES. We\nrecognize three nested subsystems of the Tongass\nsystem (Fig. 1): the \u201cinstitutional subsystem,\u201d\nincluding the U.S. Forest Service, principally the\nTongass administration; the \u201cpolicy subsystem\u201d\nthat governs Tongass management and land-use\ndecision making; and the \u201ceconomic subsystem\u201d\nthat defines the structure, capacity, and efficiency\nof the regional industry and market value of its\nproducts. Each subsystem may experience adaptive\ncycles of change influenced by internal components\nand drivers of change (e.g., Tongass managers and\ntheir preferences, legislation specific to Tongass\ngovernance, and economic factors pertaining to\nlocal industry) as well as external components and\ndrivers (e.g., national leadership in the Forest\nService, federal legislation, and global timber\nmarkets) (Fig. 1). Our approach is to explain larger-\nscale SES dynamics by describing the subsystem\ndynamics, which are more easily observed and can\ngenerate transformative feedbacks at larger scales\n(Walker et al. 2004).\n\nIn this article, governance concerns the decisions\nmade regarding the policy goals for the Tongass in\nthe context of a broader vision and purpose for the\nregion of southeastern Alaska, specifically its\ncommunities and natural resources. Management is\nthe active implementation of specific practices, such\nas industrial even-aged forestry, to reach these\nobjectives. Governance emerges primarily from the\npolicy subsystem and management emerges\nprimarily from the institutional subsystem, although\nthe two are functionally coupled.\n\nFor this case study, we narrowly define the regional\necosystem with a focus on environmental factors\nthat directly influenced governance and management,\n\nand the processes that controlled ecological\nresponses to management practices. These include\nthe condition of the old-growth forest resource,\nspatial variation in forest productivity, and the\nremote and rugged geography of the region that\nshaped the options available for resource\ndevelopment (Fig. 1). We did not address\nsuccessional dynamics because these primary\nforests were largely unmodified by human actions\nwhen industrial forestry began, and because second-\ngrowth forests did not reach a harvestable age during\nthe short lifespan of industrial forestry in the region.\nHanley et al. (2005) and Beier et al. (2008) address\nthe longer-term ecological implications of clearcut\nharvesting and even-aged management practices in\nthe temperate rainforests of southeastern Alaska.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nUsing this system structure and the adaptive-cycle\nframework, we developed a historical narrative of\nthe Tongass system that traces a complete loop of\nthe adaptive cycle, beginning with the creation of\nthe Tongass National Forest (1908), passage of key\nlegislation fostering industrial development (1947),\nboom years during which timber production peaked\n(1970), collapse of the regional industry (1997), and\nthe contentious stalemate of the present day (2009).\nIn parallel with this narrative, we traced system\ndynamics using annual timber outputs, a\nquantitative variable reflecting an emergent\nproperty of the Tongass system.

Longitudinal analysis of annual timber harvest outputs from the Tongass National Forest and\nsubsystem dynamics (see Appendix 2), divided into the four phases of the adaptive cycle: organization,\ngrowth, conservation, and collapse.\n\nits earliest beginnings, Tongass managers were\npioneers of a broad vision to encourage regional\npopulation growth and establish a clear U.S.\npresence in Alaska by developing a strong, self-\nsufficient economy based on timber production\n(Rakestraw 1989, Nie 2006). The roots of the\nTongass approach\u2014to convert old-growth forests\nto \u201cmore manageable\u201d second-growth stands, while\nfueling a forest-products industry based on pulp and\nsawtimber\u2014were evident upon completion of the\nfirst federal inventories. In 1909, Tongass officials\nsuggested that pulp production was the best use of\nold-growth rainforests, that \u201cthe chief need is for a\n\nplanned harvest of the mature timber\u201d (Rakestraw\n1989:23), and recommended revision of federal law\nto allow the sale of National Forest lands for\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, this industrial approach required\nsignificant private investment to establish a\nsufficient economy of scale to make Tongass timber\nprofitable. Despite the pursuit of such investments\nby key figures, including U.S. Forest Service Chief\nWilliam Greeley in the 1920s and Alaska Regional\nForester Frank Heintzleman throughout the 1930s\nand 1940s, these efforts were thwarted by economic\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nconstraints, including poor regional infrastructure,\ndistance from markets, and the Great Depression.\n\nWorld War II and its aftermath provided the catalyst\nto implement industrial forestry in the Tongass,\nbecause American wartime demand for airplane\nlumber exceeded supplies in Oregon and\nWashington, which had been depleted during World\nWar I. To capture this opportunity, Heintzleman\nsought the advice of timber-industry executives in\npresenting his case for what became the Alaska\nSpruce Log Program (ASLP). Created as an agency\nin 1942, ASLP supplied mills in the continental\nUnited States with high-grade Sitka spruce logs\nfrom the Tongass. At the time, Tongass logging\noccurred primarily by hand-felling the best trees in\naccessible sites, such as beach fringes and river\nbottoms. However, the collective opinion of\nTongass managers, many of whom were\nprofessionally trained foresters, was that clearcutting\nwas a far superior method (Rakestraw 1989).\nTaylor\u2019s (1935) Ecology article provided scientific\njustification for the change from high grading to\nclearcutting in the Alaskan rainforest. With this\njustification, Tongass managers shifted the\nsilvicultural prescription to clearcutting and sought\nto demonstrate the economic viability of harvesting\nthe low-grade timber that comprised the majority of\nthe Tongass timber base.\n\nIn the 18 months of ASLP operation, the program\nexported 38.5 million board feet (MBF) of high-\ngrade spruce to continental U.S. mills, and\ntransferred 46 MBF of lower (utility) grade material\nto local Alaska mills. The ASLP-legislated target\nwas 100 MBF/year of high-grade Sitka spruce, with\nno mention of low-grade materials whatsoever.\nAlthough short lived, the wartime program\ndemonstrated the commercial viability of both\nsawtimber and utility-grade materials from the\nTongass. It also forged strong relationships among\nTongass officials, national policy makers, and\ntimber-industry representatives (Rakestraw 1989).\n\nIn summary, the organization [\u03b1] phase consisted\nof a series of events that initiated adaptive cycles\nsimultaneously in the institutional, policy, and\neconomic subsystems. These adaptive cycles in the\nsubsystems defined the future configuration of the\nTongass system and prepared it for transformation\n(Appendix 2). Key actors in these subsystems\nworked together to shape a common vision of\nindustrial forestry in Alaska (i.e., built the horizontal\nlinks among subsystems), which they viewed as\n\nboth the best path to economic growth and self-\nsufficiency and the best practice for using and\nmanaging the region\u2019s abundant forest resources.\n\nGrowth Phase [r] 1947\u20131975\n\nThe passage of the Tongass Timber Act (TTA) in\n1947 was a landmark event in forest governance that\nmoved the Tongass system into the growth [r] phase.\nWith the TTA, Tongass officials applied a federally\nmandated blueprint to mobilize the resources and\nexpertise required to make industrial forestry a\nreality in Alaska\u2014analogous to the rapid biomass\naccumulation and altered competitive balance\namong species in an early successional forest. In the\nTongass, this involved development of a trained\nworkforce and infrastructure; long-term timber\nleases that altered the relationship between forest\nmanagers and forest users; and increased production\nof forest products (Fig. 2). By authorizing long-term\nguaranteed contracts, favorable scaling and pricing\nrules, and several other subsidies, the TTA provided\nthe impetus needed to overcome economic\nthresholds and transform to a new state of industrial\nforestry.\n\nThe provisions of the TTA were framed by\nlegislators, Tongass officials, and timber-industry\nexecutives. The latter two groups of actors had\nnegotiated terms of lease contracts before the\nlegislation\u2019s passage (Rakestraw 1989). Other\ninterests, including other federal agencies with\nstakes in Alaska land management, were summarily\nexcluded from negotiations, and the bill received\nlittle debate in Congress. The preparation and\npassage of the TTA galvanized the close links\namong agency, legislative, and private-industry\nactors (Rakestraw 1989, Nie 2006), forming a\n\u201cpolicy monopoly\u201d (Baumgartner and Jones 1993,\nKingdon 1995, True et al. 1999) of the Tongass\nsystem, which achieved unprecedented measures to\nfoster industrial-scale forestry, including long-term\nleases that guaranteed non-competitive access to\nmillions of acres of publicly owned forest land.\nLease holders were required to operate pulp mills\nin the region and, in return, received low-interest\nloans, a favorable log-scaling system, and refunds\nof road-building costs (Soderberg and DuRette\n1988). Harvest units in leases were planned largely\nby company foresters and then released to lease\nholders on demand (without open bidding) by the\nTongass. The U.S. Forest Service planning process\nat this time was relatively unfettered by legislative\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\ncomplications, public participation, or judicial\ndecisions (Nie 2006). As a result, there was a low\ndegree of transparency and a high degree of internal\ncontrol in the execution of the long-term timber\ncontracts; such traits are characteristic of industries\noperating on public resources through a policy\nmonopoly (Repetto 1988).\n\nEarly in this period, the Tongass system mobilized\nrapidly in the direction prescribed and supported by\nits policy monopoly. Immediately after the TTA,\nthe U.S. Forest Service and the newly formed\nKetchikan Pulp Company (KPC) agreed to\npreliminary terms of a lease contract. The KPC\ncontract was finalized in 1951 and guaranteed over\n8.5 billion board feet of timber over 50 years, subject\nto 5-year reviews by the U.S. Forest Service; the\nKPC contract set aside nearly one-fifth of the\nTongass for exclusive bidding rights (Soderberg and\nDuRette 1988). In 1953, the Japanese-owned\nAlaska Pulp Development Co. was incorporated in\nthe United States and signed a 50-year, 4.5 billion\nboard foot contract requiring construction of a large\nsawmill and pulp mill in Sitka. By 1959, the Alaska\nPulp Company (APC) was in operation in Sitka.\nAnother long-term contract with the Pacific\nNorthwest Timber Co. was finalized with the\nconstruction of large sawmill in Wrangell. Other\nlease offerings included large tracts in some of the\nmost biologically rich areas of the Tongass, e.g.,\none lease included nearly 90% of productive forests\non Admiralty Island, which today exists as a\nkeystone reserve of regional biodiversity (Beier\n2008).\n\nWithin 5 years of passage of the TTA, roughly 14\nbillion board feet of Tongass timber was under\ncontract to lease holders. In 1953, Regional Forester\nHeintzleman retired from the U.S. Forest Service\nand was appointed Territorial Governor of Alaska,\nwhere he continued vigorous pursuit of\nprogressively larger timber leases in the region\n(Rakestraw 1989). The three existing lease contracts\nproduced over 90% of Tongass timber harvested\nduring the 1960s and 1970s. In the early 1970s, the\nsystem\u2019s growth phase reached several milestones:\nmaximum annual harvest from the Tongass (560\nMBF), maximum Alaskan share of U.S. timber\nexports to Japan (42%), and the small town of\nKetchikan became the third-largest producer of\ncellulose pulp in the world.\n\nDuring this period, a series of legislative and judicial\ndecisions (Appendix 3), beginning in 1960 with the\n\nMultiple Use Sustained Yield Act (MUSYA), began\nto erode the discretional authority of the U.S. Forest\nService (LeMaster 1984). These \u201cperturbations\u201d to\nthe Tongass policy subsystem were largely driven\nby the growing influence of the U.S. environmental\nmovement. With the exception of one major lawsuit\n(Sierra Club v Hardin), these events were not\nspecific to the Tongass and did not significantly\ninfluence system behavior, based on harvest trends\n(Fig. 2). However, these events did begin to\nchallenge the Tongass policy monopoly and its\ncontrol over forest governance by establishing new\nrules and venues for debate and decision making.\nFor this reason, these events provide a window into\nhow the Tongass system was stabilized, or\nconserved, in the face of change\u2014these interactions\nare the focus of the following section.\n\nIn summary, during the growth [r] phase, Tongass\ntimber outputs grew rapidly and stabilized at a\nharvest level roughly 20 times greater than during\nthe organization [\u03b1] phase (Fig. 2). This\ntransformation in the Tongass system resulted from\na solidification of the links among the institutional,\npolicy, and economic subsystems, creating a rigid\nsystem that had minimal transparency or links to\nother processes such as the environmental lobby or\nsmall-scale logging companies that had interests in\nTongass governance. The mills in Ketchikan, Sitka,\nand Wrangell prospered, and the regional industry\nsupported an estimated 3500 local jobs and\nnumerous local schools, which benefited from\ndirect transfers of timber-based revenues (Allen et\nal. 1998). At the beginning of the [r] phase,\nlegislation created positive feedbacks in the policy\nsubsystem that triggered implementation of the\nTongass system; and toward its conclusion,\nlegislation created negative feedbacks that\nincreased the rigidity of internal links among all\nsubsystems of the Tongass. During this period, the\neconomic subsystem was driven largely by positive\nfeedbacks fostering continued growth in forest-\nproducts manufacturing (Appendix 2), which\npeaked in 1970. Because of the tight links among\nthe three subsystems, the positive feedbacks in the\npolicy and economic subsystems drove the growth\nof the Tongass system.\n\nConservation phase [K] 1975\u20131990\n\nBefore 1975, the Tongass system and its policy\nmonopoly remained largely unfettered by changes\nin public opinion and federal policy associated with\n\nThis content downloaded from \n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd24.162.145.200 on Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:33:51 UTC\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\n\nEcology and Society 14(2): 5\nhttp://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art5/\n\nthe environmental movement. In 1975, for the first\ntime, a federal court ruled against the practice of\nclearcut logging in the Tongass. This event moved\nthe Tongass system into a conservation [K] phase\n\u2014a state analogous to the \u201cclimax\u201d stage of a mature\nforest when the dominant canopy trees strongly\ninfluence endogenous conditions and the system is\nlargely resilient to disturbance (Holling and\nGunderson 2002). During this phase, the Tongass\nsystem faced external, converging drivers of change\nin public policy (Nie 2006), institutional\ngovernance (LeMaster 1984), and global markets\n(Crone 2004). The interactions of these drivers with\ncomponents of the Tongass system revealed the\nmechanisms providing stability and resilience, as\nwell as incipient vulnerabilities.

This theory is undergirded by the values of individualism and the assumption that resources are limited and must be protected from overuse by individual actors. Hardin&#x27;s approach often suggests regulatory or privatization solutions to manage resources.\n\n**Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s &#x27;Community Governance&#x27;** counters the tragedy by showing how local communities can successfully manage resources without external controls or privatization, through collective action and self-governance. Her theory is grounded in values of community, mutual benefits, and adaptability, demonstrating that collective, context-specific solutions can sustainably manage resources.\n\n### Assumptions in Hardin&#x27;s Theory\n\nHardin assumes that:\n1. **Rational Individuals:** People act independently based on rational self-interest, leading inevitably to resource overuse.\n2. **Limited Resources:** Resources are finite and must be either regulated or privatized to prevent depletion.\n3. **Necessity of External Intervention:** External authorities or privatization are needed to manage resources sustainably.\n\nI would argue that while Hardin&#x27;s view helps understand certain dilemmas like pollution or overfishing, it does not account for the complexities of human behavior and the potential for cooperative governance seen in Ostrom\u2019s work. Ostrom\u2019s approach acknowledges the capabilities of communities to create rules and institutions that manage resources effectively without external enforcement.\n\n### Systems of Controls\n\n**Hardin\u2019s Solutions:** Often involve top-down regulations or privatizing resources to align individual incentives with societal good.\n\n**Ostrom\u2019s Solutions:** Focus on bottom-up, community-based management where rules are adapted to specific local conditions and resource systems, demonstrating flexibility and adaptability.\n\n### Real-World Example: Palm Oil Industry\n\n#### Sustainability Measures and Transparency\nThe palm oil industry, often criticized for deforestation and habitat destruction, has seen initiatives like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) which certifies sustainable palm oil production. Companies under RSPO must adhere to criteria ensuring environmental, economic, and social sustainability.\n\n#### Ethical Production Ratings\nSome palm oil producers have received certifications indicating better practices, but global standards vary significantly, and enforcement is uneven.\n\n#### Potential Improvements\nCompanies could improve by enhancing transparency in supply chains, committing to zero deforestation, and increasing support for smallholder farmers.\n\n#### Argument for Additional Sustainability Measures\nImplementing stricter sustainability measures could significantly benefit the environment by reducing deforestation and carbon emissions. Social benefits include improved conditions for workers and reduced conflict over land. These benefits likely outweigh the costs of implementing such measures, which include increased financial investments and potential short-term decreases in profit margins.\n\n#### Enforcement\nEnforcement could be managed through stricter national regulations, international agreements, and consumer pressure demanding certified products.\n\n#### Complexity and Cost\nTransitioning to sustainable practices involves complex changes in supply chain management, increased costs for certification, and potentially higher operational costs. However, the long-term benefits of maintaining biodiversity, reducing carbon footprints, and improving social outcomes provide a compelling case for these changes.\n\nThis analysis shows the contrast between Hardin&#x27;s approach, which might argue for stringent controls or privatization, and Ostrom&#x27;s, which would advocate for community-led initiatives and local governance structures tailored to the specific context of the palm oil industry."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The industry faces sustainability and ethical production challenges that are closely tied to environmental and social factors.\n\n#### Sustainability Measures and Transparency\nItalian olive oil producers often adopt sustainable practices such as organic farming, which avoids the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, reducing environmental impact and promoting biodiversity. Some producers also use modern irrigation systems that conserve water, a critical resource in Mediterranean agriculture.\n\n#### Ethical Production Ratings\nItaly, being part of the European Union, adheres to stringent EU regulations that cover environmental protection, labor rights, and food safety. These regulations ensure a high standard of ethical production. Additionally, certifications like the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) not only assure quality and region-specific characteristics but also promote ethical production practices by maintaining traditional methods that are often more sustainable.\n\n#### Potential Improvements\nWhile many Italian olive oil producers are moving towards sustainability, there is room for improvement, especially in reducing the carbon footprint associated with packaging and distribution. Producers could also enhance transparency in their supply chains, providing consumers with detailed information about the sourcing of olives and the production processes.\n\n#### Argument for Additional Sustainability Measures\nImplementing further sustainability measures in the Italian olive oil industry could lead to significant environmental benefits, such as greater soil health and reduced water use. Social benefits include sustaining rural communities and preserving traditional agricultural practices that are a part of Italy\u2019s cultural heritage.\n\n#### Enforcement\nSustainability measures can be enforced through national regulations that align with EU policies, coupled with incentives for farmers to adopt sustainable practices. Industry associations like Assitol could play a critical role in promoting these practices through education and certification programs.\n\n#### Complexity and Cost\nAdopting advanced sustainable technologies and practices might involve high initial costs, but these can be offset by long-term gains such as increased efficiency, improved product quality, and access to markets that value sustainability. Costs might also be mitigated by government subsidies and EU funding aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture.\n\n#### System Change Challenges\nTransitioning to more sustainable production involves overcoming challenges like the small scale of many olive farms, which can make it difficult to invest in new technologies. However, cooperative models and shared resources among small producers can facilitate this transition.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Italian olive oil industry&#x27;s move towards increased sustainability and ethical production is not only feasible but beneficial both environmentally and socially. While challenges exist, particularly in terms of cost and complexity, the long-term benefits of such initiatives significantly outweigh these difficulties. The application of Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s community governance approach could be particularly effective here, leveraging local knowledge and collective action to manage resources sustainably while preserving the cultural heritage of Italian olive oil production.\n\nThis example reflects a shift from traditional regulatory approaches towards more community-based, adaptive management strategies that align with Ostrom&#x27;s theories, contrasting with Hardin&#x27;s more rigid control measures."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

This theory explores how to provide public goods and manage common resources effectively, often challenging situations where individual rationality does not lead to rational outcomes for the group.\n\n### Key Aspects of the Theory of Collective Action\n\n1. **Public Goods**: These are goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning no one can be excluded from using the good, and one person&#x27;s use does not reduce availability to others. Classic examples include public parks, clean air, and national defense. The theory of collective action seeks to address how such goods can be efficiently provided since they often lead to free-riding behavior where individuals benefit from resources without contributing to their provision.\n\n2. **Free-Rider Problem**: This is a central issue in the theory of collective action. Since everyone can use a public good whether they pay for it or not, individuals may decide not to contribute financially or effort-wise, hoping that others will cover the cost. This behavior can lead to under-provision or non-provision of the necessary goods.\n\n3. **Social Dilemmas**: The theory often deals with social dilemmas like the &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource. Garrett Hardin&#x27;s essay on this topic illustrates how shared resources can be overused and destroyed.\n\n4. **Solutions and Institutional Responses**: Mancur Olson, in his book &quot;The Logic of Collective Action,&quot; argues that larger groups need some form of extra incentive to get their members to act in their common interest. Solutions may include coercive government intervention, regulations, privatization, or the creation of institutions that align individual incentives with group goals. Elinor Ostrom&#x27;s work extends this by showing that communities can often self-organize to manage resources sustainably without external authorities if appropriate group norms and rules are established.\n\n### Economic Implications\n\nThe theory has profound implications for economic policies, particularly in how governments and organizations design mechanisms to fund public goods and manage common resources. It impacts tax policies, regulatory approaches, and the provision of subsidies. It also influences international economics in areas like climate change agreements and collective security arrangements.\n\n### Political Science Relevance\n\nIn political science, the theory of collective action informs understanding of how political coalitions form, how lobbying works, and how collective political movements can influence policy changes. It helps explain why some groups are more powerful and effective than others in getting their interests represented in public policy.\n\nThe theory of collective action is crucial in understanding many economic and political behaviors and forms the basis for designing policies that can overcome collective action problems to achieve better outcomes for society as a whole."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Proud of his pen, \nCarnegie is today perhaps most celebrated as the author of a pair  \nof articles first published in 1889, which together have come to be \nknown as The Gospel of Wealth.

The conditions of human life have not only been \nchanged, but revolutionized, within the past few hundred years. \nIn former days there was little difference between the dwell-\ning, dress, food, and environment of the chief and those of his \nretainers. The Indians are today where civilized man then was. \nWhen visiting the Sioux, I was led to the wigwam of the chief. It \nwas just like the others in external appearance, and even within \nthe difference was trifling between it and those of the poorest \nof his braves. The contrast between the palace of the million-\naire and the cottage of the laborer with us today measures the \nchange which has come with civilization. \n\nThis change, however, is not to be deplored, but welcomed as \nhighly beneficial. It is well, nay, essential for the progress of the \nrace, that the houses of some should be homes for all that is \nhighest and best in literature and the arts, and for all the refine-\nments of civilization, rather than that none should be so. Much \nbetter this great irregularity than universal squalor. Without \nwealth there can be no Maecenas. The \u201cgood old times\u201d were not \ngood old times. Neither master nor servant was as well situated \nthen as today. A relapse to old conditions would be disastrous \nto both\u2014not the least so to him who serves\u2014and would sweep \n\n I. \nWEALTH\n\n\n\n2\n\naway civilization with it. But whether the change be for good or \nill, it is upon us, beyond our power to alter, and therefore to be \naccepted and made the best of. It is a waste of time to criticize \nthe inevitable.\n\nIt is easy to see how the change has come. One illustration will \nserve for almost every phase of the cause. In the manufacture of \nproducts we have the whole story. It applies to all combinations \nof human industry, as stimulated and enlarged by the inventions \nof this scientific age. Formerly articles were manufactured at \nthe domestic hearth or in small shops which formed part of the \nhousehold. The master and his apprentices worked side by side, \nthe latter living with the master, and therefore subject to the \nsame conditions. When these apprentices rose to be masters, \nthere was little or no change in their mode of life, and they, in \nturn, educated in the same routine succeeding apprentices. \nThere was, substantially, social equality, and even political \nequality, for those engaged in industrial pursuits had then little \nor no political voice in the State.\n\nBut the inevitable result of such a mode of manufacture was \ncrude articles at high prices. Today the world obtains commod-\nities of excellent quality at prices which even the generation \npreceding this would have deemed incredible. In the commer-\ncial world similar causes have produced similar results, and the \nrace is benefited thereby. The poor enjoy what the rich could not \nbefore afford. What were the luxuries have become the necessar-\nies of life. The laborer has now more comforts than the farmer \nhad a few generations ago. The farmer has more luxuries than \nthe landlord had, and is more richly clad and better housed. The \nlandlord has books and pictures rarer, and appointments more \nartistic, than the King could then obtain.\n\nThe price we pay for this salutary change is, no doubt, great. We \nassemble thousands of operatives in the factory, in the mine, \n\n\n\n3THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nand in the countinghouse, of whom the employer can know \nlittle or nothing, and to whom the employer is little better than \na myth. All intercourse between them is at an end. Rigid Castes \nare formed, and, as usual, mutual ignorance breeds mutual \ndistrust. Each Caste is without sympathy for the other, and \nready to credit anything disparaging in regard to it. Under the \nlaw of competition, the employer of thousands is forced into the \nstrictest economies, among which the rates paid to labor figure \nprominently, and often there is friction between the employer \nand the employed, between capital and labor, between rich and \npoor. Human society loses homogeneity.\n\nThe price which society pays for the law of competition, like the \nprice it pays for cheap comforts and luxuries, is also great; but \nthe advantages of this law are also greater still, for it is to this \nlaw that we owe our wonderful material development, which \nbrings improved conditions in its train. But, whether the law \nbe benign or not, we must say of it, as we say of the change in \nthe conditions of men to which we have referred: It is here; we \ncannot evade it; no substitutes for it have been found; and while \nthe law may be sometimes hard for the individual, it is best for \nthe race, because it insures the survival of the fittest in every \ndepartment. We accept and welcome, therefore, as conditions \nto which we must accommodate ourselves, great inequality \nof environment, the concentration of business, industrial and \ncommercial, in the hands of a few, and the law of competition \nbetween these, as being not only beneficial, but essential for the \nfuture progress of the race. Having accepted these, it follows \nthat there must be great scope for the exercise of special ability \nin the merchant and in the manufacturer who has to conduct \naffairs upon a great scale. That this talent for organization \nand management is rare among men is proved by the fact that \nit invariably secures for its possessor enormous rewards, no \nmatter where or under what laws or conditions. The experienced \nin affairs always rate the man whose services can be obtained \n\n\n\n4\n\nas a partner as not only the first consideration, but such as to \nrender the question of his capital scarcely worth considering, for \nsuch men soon create capital; while, without the special talent \nrequired, capital soon takes wings. Such men become interested \nin firms or corporations using millions; and estimating only \nsimple interest to be made upon the capital invested, it is inevi-\ntable that their income must exceed their expenditures, and that \nthey must accumulate wealth. Nor is there any middle ground \nwhich such men can occupy, because the great manufacturing or \ncommercial concern which does not earn at least interest upon \nits capital soon becomes bankrupt. It must either go forward or \nfall behind: to stand still is impossible. It is a condition essential \nfor its successful operation that it should be thus far profitable, \nand even that, in addition to interest on capital, it should make \nprofit. It is a law, as certain as any of the others named, that \nmen possessed of this peculiar talent for affairs, under the free \nplay of economic forces, must, of necessity, soon be in receipt \nof more revenue than can be judiciously expended upon them-\nselves; and this law is as beneficial for the race as the others.\n\nObjections to the foundations upon which society is based are \nnot in order, because the condition of the race is better with \nthese than it has been with any others which have been tried. \nOf the effect of any new substitutes proposed we cannot be \nsure. The Socialist or Anarchist who seeks to overturn pres-\nent conditions is to be regarded as attacking the foundation \nupon which civilization itself rests, for civilization took its start \nfrom the day that the capable, industrious workman said to his \nincompetent and lazy fellow, \u201cIf thou dost not sow, thou shalt \nnot reap,\u201d and thus ended primitive Communism by separat-\ning the drones from the bees. One who studies this subject will \nsoon be brought face to face with the conclusion that upon the \nsacredness of property civilization itself depends\u2014the right \nof the laborer to his hundred dollars in the savings bank, and \nequally the legal right of the millionaire to his millions. To \n\n\n\n5THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nthose who propose to substitute Communism for this intense \nIndividualism the answer, therefore, is: The race has tried that. \nAll progress from that barbarous day to the present time has \nresulted from its displacement. Not evil, but good, has come to \nthe race from the accumulation of wealth by those who have the \nability and energy that produce it. But even if we admit for a \nmoment that it might be better for the race to discard its present \nfoundation, Individualism\u2014that it is a nobler ideal that man \n\nshould labor, not for himself alone, but in and for a brotherhood \nof his fellows, and share with them all in common, realizing \nSwedenborg\u2019s idea of Heaven, where, as he says, the angels \nderive their happiness, not from laboring for self, but for each \nother\u2014even admit all this, and a sufficient answer is, This is not \nevolution, but revolution. It necessitates the changing of human \nnature itself\u2014a work of eons, even if it were good to change it, \nwhich we cannot know. It is not practicable in our day or in our \nage. Even if desirable theoretically, it belongs to another and \nlong-succeeding sociological stratum. Our duty is with what \nis practicable now; with the next step possible in our day and \ngeneration. It is criminal to waste our energies in endeavoring to \nuproot, when all we can profitably or possibly accomplish is to \nbend the universal tree of humanity a little in the direction most \nfavorable to the production of good fruit under existing circum-\nstances. We might as well urge the destruction of the highest \n\nOur duty is with what is  \npracticable now; with  \nthe next step possible in  \nour day and generation.\n\n\n\n6\n\nexisting type of man because he failed to reach our ideal as to \nfavor the destruction of Individualism, Private Property, the \nLaw of Accumulation of Wealth, and the Law of Competition; \nfor these are the highest results of human experience, the soil \nin which society so far has produced the best fruit. Unequally or \nunjustly, perhaps, as these laws sometimes operate, and imper-\nfect as they appear to the Idealist, they are, nevertheless, like \nthe highest type of man, the best and most valuable of all that \nhumanity has yet accomplished.\n\nWe start, then, with a condition of affairs under which the best \ninterests of the race are promoted, but which inevitably gives \nwealth to the few. Thus far, accepting conditions as they exist, \nthe situation can be surveyed and pronounced good. The ques-\ntion then arises\u2014and, if the foregoing be correct, it is the only \nquestion with which we have to deal\u2014What is the proper mode \nof administering wealth after the laws upon which civilization \nis founded have thrown it into the hands of the few? And it is of \nthis great question that I believe I offer the true solution. It will \nbe understood that fortunes are here spoken of, not moderate \nsums saved by many years of effort, the returns from which \nare required for the comfortable maintenance and education \nof families. This is not wealth, but only competence, which it \nshould be the aim of all to acquire.\n\nThere are but three modes in which surplus wealth can be \ndisposed of. It can be left to the families of the decedents; or \nit can be bequeathed for public purposes; or, finally, it can be \nadministered during their lives by its possessors. Under the \nfirst and second modes most of the wealth of the world that \nhas reached the few has hitherto been applied. Let us in turn \nconsider each of these modes. The first is the most injudicious. \nIn monarchical countries, the estates and the greatest portion of \nthe wealth are left to the first son, that the vanity of the parent \nmay be gratified by the thought that his name and title are to \n\n\n\n7THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\ndescend to succeeding generations unimpaired. The condition \nof this class in Europe today teaches the futility of such hopes or \nambitions. The successors have become impoverished through \ntheir follies or from the fall in the value of land. Even in Great \nBritain the strict law of entail has been found inadequate to \nmaintain the status of a hereditary class. Its soil is rapidly pass-\ning into the hands of the stranger. Under republican institutions \nthe division of property among the children is much fairer, \nbut the question which forces itself upon thoughtful men in all \nlands is: Why should men leave great fortunes to their children? \nIf this is done from affection, is it not misguided affection? \nObservation teaches that, generally speaking, it is not well \nfor the children that they should be so burdened. Neither is it \nwell for the state. Beyond providing for the wife and daughters \nmoderate sources of income, and very moderate allowances \nindeed, if any, for the sons, men may well hesitate, for it is no \nlonger questionable that great sums bequeathed oftener work \nmore for the injury than for the good of the recipients. Wise men \nwill soon conclude that, for the best interests of the members of \ntheir families and of the state, such bequests are an improper \nuse of their means.\n\nIt is not suggested that men who have failed to educate their sons \nto earn a livelihood shall cast them adrift in poverty. If any man \nhas seen fit to rear his sons with a view to their living idle lives, \nor, what is highly commendable, has instilled in them the senti-\nment that they are in a position to labor for public ends without \nreference to pecuniary considerations, then, of course, the duty \nof the parent is to see that such are provided for in moderation. \nThere are instances of millionaires\u2019 sons unspoiled by wealth, \nwho, being rich, still perform great services in the community. \nSuch are the very salt of the earth, as valuable as, unfortunately, \nthey are rare; still it is not the exception, but the rule, that men \nmust regard, and, looking at the usual result of enormous sums \nconferred upon legatees, the thoughtful man must shortly say, \n\n\n\n8\n\n\u201cI would as soon leave to my son a curse as the almighty dollar,\u201d \nand admit to himself that it is not the welfare of the children, but \nfamily pride, which inspires these enormous legacies.\n\nAs to the second mode, that of leaving wealth at death for public \nuses, it may be said that this is only a means for the disposal of \nwealth, provided a man is content to wait until he is dead before \nit becomes of much good in the world. Knowledge of the results \nof legacies bequeathed is not calculated to inspire the brightest \nhopes of much posthumous good being accomplished. The cases \nare not few in which the real object sought by the testator is not \nattained, nor are they few in which his real wishes are thwarted. \nIn many cases the bequests are so used as to become only \nmonuments of his folly. It is well to remember that it requires \nthe exercise of not less ability than that which acquired the \nwealth to use it so as to be really beneficial to the community. \nBesides this, it may fairly be said that no man is to be extolled \nfor doing what he cannot help doing, nor is he to be thanked by \nthe community to which he only leaves wealth at death. Men \nwho leave vast sums in this way may fairly be thought men who \nwould not have left it at all, had they been able to take it with \nthem. The memories of such cannot be held in grateful remem-\nbrance, for there is no grace in their gifts. It is not to be wondered \nat that such bequests seem so generally to lack the blessing.\n\nThe growing disposition to tax more and more heavily large \nestates left at death is a cheering indication of the growth of a \nsalutary change in public opinion. The State of Pennsylvania \nnow takes\u2014subject to some exceptions\u2014one-tenth of the \nproperty left by its citizens. The budget presented in the British \nParliament the other day proposes to increase the death duties; \nand, most significant of all, the new tax is to be a graduated \none. Of all forms of taxation, this seems the wisest. Men who \ncontinue hoarding great sums all their lives, the proper use \nof which for public ends would work good to the community, \n\n\n\n9THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nshould be made to feel that the community, in the form of the \nstate, cannot thus be deprived of its proper share. By taxing \nestates heavily at death the state marks its condemnation of the \nselfish millionaire\u2019s unworthy life.\n\nIt is desirable that nations should go much further in this direc-\ntion. Indeed, it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich \nman\u2019s estate which should go at his death to the public through \nthe agency of the state, and by all means such taxes should be \ngraduated, beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to depen-\ndents, and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell, until of the \nmillionaire\u2019s hoard, as of Shylock\u2019s, at least\n\n  The other half\n Comes to the privy coffer of the state.\n\nThis policy would work powerfully to induce the rich man to \nattend to the administration of wealth during his life, which is \nthe end that society should always have in view, as being that \nby far most fruitful for the people. Nor need it be feared that \nthis policy would sap the root of enterprise and render men less \nanxious to accumulate, for to the class whose ambition it is to \nleave great fortunes and be talked about after their death, it will \nattract even more attention, and, indeed, be a somewhat nobler \nambition to have enormous sums paid over to the state from \ntheir fortunes.\n\nThere remains, then, only one mode of using great fortunes; \nbut in this we have the true antidote for the temporary unequal \ndistribution of wealth, the reconciliation of the rich and the \npoor\u2014a reign of harmony\u2014another ideal, differing, indeed, \nfrom that of the Communist in requiring only the further \nevolution of existing conditions, not the total overthrow of our \ncivilization. It is founded upon the present most intense individ-\nualism, and the race is prepared to put it in practice by degrees \nwhenever it pleases. Under its sway we shall have an ideal state, \n\n\n\n10\n\nin which the surplus wealth of the few will become, in the best \nsense, the property of the many, because administered for the \ncommon good, and this wealth, passing through the hands of \nthe few, can be made a much more potent force for the elevation \nof our race than if it had been distributed in small sums to the \npeople themselves. Even the poorest can be made to see this, \nand to agree that great sums gathered by some of their fellow \ncitizens and spent for public purposes, from which the masses \nreap the principal benefit, are more valuable to them than if \nscattered among them through the course of many years in \ntrifling amounts.\n\nIf we consider what results flow from the Cooper Institute, \nfor instance, to the best portion of the race in New York not \npossessed of means, and compare these with those which would \nhave arisen for the good of the masses from an equal sum \ndistributed by Mr. Cooper in his lifetime in the form of wages, \nwhich is the highest form of distribution, being for work done \nand not for charity, we can form some estimate of the possibili-\nties for the improvement of the race which lie embedded in the \npresent law of the accumulation of wealth. Much of this sum, if \ndistributed in small quantities among the people, would have \nbeen wasted in the indulgence of appetite, some of it in excess, \nand it may be doubted whether even the part put to the best use, \nthat of adding to the comforts of the home, would have yielded \nresults for the race, as a race, at all comparable to those which \nare flowing and are to flow from the Cooper Institute from \ngeneration to generation. Let the advocate of violent or radical \nchange ponder well this thought.\n\nWe might even go so far as to take another instance, that of Mr. \nTilden\u2019s bequest of five millions of dollars for a free library in \nthe city of New York, but in referring to this one cannot help \nsaying involuntarily, How much better if Mr. Tilden had devoted \nthe last years of his own life to the proper administration of this \n\n\n\n11THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nimmense sum; in which case neither legal contest nor any other \ncause of delay could have interfered with his aims. But let us \nassume that Mr. Tilden\u2019s millions finally become the means of \ngiving to this city a noble public library, where the treasures of \nthe world contained in books will be open to all forever, without \nmoney and without price. Considering the good of that part of \nthe race which congregates in and around Manhattan Island, \nwould its permanent benefit have been better promoted had \nthese millions been allowed to circulate in small sums through \nthe hands of the masses? Even the most strenuous advocate of \nCommunism must entertain a doubt upon this subject. Most of \nthose who think will probably entertain no doubt whatever.\n\nPoor and restricted are our opportunities in this life; narrow our \nhorizon; our best work most imperfect; but rich men should be \nthankful for one inestimable boon. They have it in their power \nduring their lives to busy themselves in organizing benefac-\ntions from which the masses of their fellows will derive lasting \nadvantage, and thus dignify their own lives. The highest life \nis probably to be reached, not by such imitation of the life of \nChrist as Count Tolstoy gives us, but, while animated by Christ\u2019s \nspirit, by recognizing the changed conditions of this age, and \n\nPoor and restricted are our opportunities in \nthis life; narrow our horizon; our best work \nmost imperfect; but rich men should be thankful \nfor one inestimable boon. They have it in their \npower during their lives to busy themselves in \norganizing benefactions from which the masses \nof their fellows will derive lasting advantage, \nand thus dignify their own lives.\n\n\n\n12\n\nadopting modes of expressing this spirit suitable to the changed \nconditions under which we live; still laboring for the good of \nour fellows, which was the essence of his life and teaching, but \nlaboring in a different manner.\n\nThis, then, is held to be the duty of the man of Wealth: First, \nto set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning \ndisplay or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legiti-\nmate wants of those dependent upon him; and after doing so \nto consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as \ntrust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly \nbound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, in \nhis judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial \nresults for the community\u2014the man of wealth thus becoming \nthe mere agent and trustee for his poorer brethren, bringing \nto their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to \nadminister, doing for them better than they would or could do \nfor themselves.\n\nWe are met here with the difficulty of determining what are \nmoderate sums to leave to members of the family; what is \nmodest, unostentatious living; what is the test of extravagance. \nThere must be different standards for different conditions. The \nanswer is that it is as impossible to name exact amounts or \nactions as it is to define good manners, good taste, or the rules \nof propriety; but, nevertheless, these are verities, well known \nalthough undefinable. Public sentiment is quick to know and \nto feel what offends these. So in the case of wealth. The rule in \nregard to good taste in the dress of men or women applies here. \nWhatever makes one conspicuous offends the canon. If any \nfamily be chiefly known for display, for extravagance in home, \ntable, equipage, for enormous sums ostentatiously spent in \nany form upon itself\u2014if these be its chief distinctions, we have \nno difficulty in estimating its nature or culture. So likewise in \nregard to the use or abuse of its surplus wealth, or to generous, \n\n\n\n13THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nfree-handed cooperation in good public uses, or to unabated \nefforts to accumulate and hoard to the last, whether they \nadminister or bequeath. The verdict rests with the best and most \nenlightened public sentiment. The community will surely judge, \nand its judgments will not often be wrong.\n\nThe best uses to which surplus wealth can be put have already \nbeen indicated. Those who would administer wisely must, \nindeed, be wise, for one of the serious obstacles to the improve-\nment of our race is indiscriminate charity. It were better for \nmankind that the millions of the rich were thrown into the sea \nthan so spent as to encourage the slothful, the drunken, the \nunworthy. Of every thousand dollars spent in so called char-\nity today, it is probable that $950 is unwisely spent; so spent, \nindeed, as to produce the very evils which it proposes to miti-\ngate or cure. A well-known writer of philosophic books admitted \nthe other day that he had given a quarter of a dollar to a man \nwho approached him as he was coming to visit the house of \nhis friend. He knew nothing of the habits of this beggar; knew \nnot the use that would be made of this money, although he \nhad every reason to suspect that it would be spent improperly. \nThis man professed to be a disciple of Herbert Spencer; yet the \nquarter dollar given that night will probably work more injury \nthan all the money which its thoughtless donor will ever be able \nto give in true charity will do good. He only gratified his own \nfeelings, saved himself from annoyance\u2014and this was probably \none of the most selfish and very worst actions of his life, for in \nall respects he is most worthy.\n\nIn bestowing charity, the main consideration should be to help \nthose who will help themselves; to provide part of the means \nby which those who desire to improve may do so; to give those \nwho desire to rise the aids by which they may rise; to assist, but \nrarely or never to do all. Neither the individual nor the race is \nimproved by almsgiving. Those worthy of assistance, except \n\n\n\n14\n\nin rare cases, seldom require assistance. The really valuable \nmen of the race never do, except in cases of accident or sudden \nchange. Everyone has, of course, cases of individuals brought to \nhis own knowledge where temporary assistance can do genuine \ngood, and these he will not overlook. But the amount which can \nbe wisely given by the individual for individuals is necessarily \nlimited by his lack of knowledge of the circumstances connected \nwith each. He is the only true reformer who is as careful and as \nanxious not to aid the unworthy as he is to aid the worthy, and, \nperhaps, even more so, for in almsgiving more injury is probably \ndone by rewarding vice than by relieving virtue.\n\nThe rich man is thus almost restricted to following the exam-\nples of Peter Cooper, Enoch Pratt of Baltimore, Mr. Pratt of \nBrooklyn, Senator Stanford, and others, who know that the best \nmeans of benefiting the community is to place within its reach \nthe ladders upon which the aspiring can rise\u2014parks, and means \nof recreation, by which men are helped in body and mind; works \nof art, certain to give pleasure and improve the public taste; \nand public institutions of various kinds, which will improve the \ngeneral condition of the people; in this manner returning their \n\nThere is no mode of disposing  \nof surplus wealth creditable  \nto thoughtful and earnest men  \ninto whose hands it flows save  \nby using it year by year for  \nthe general good.\n\n\n\n15THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nsurplus wealth to the mass of their fellows in the forms best \ncalculated to do them lasting good.\n\nThus is the problem of Rich and Poor to be solved. The laws \nof accumulation will be left free; the laws of distribution free. \nIndividualism will continue, but the millionaire will be but a \ntrustee for the poor; entrusted for a season with a great part of \nthe increased wealth of the community, but administering it \nfor the community far better than it could or would have done \nfor itself. The best minds will thus have reached a stage in the \ndevelopment of the race in which it is clearly seen that there is \nno mode of disposing of surplus wealth creditable to thought-\nful and earnest men into whose hands it flows save by using it \nyear by year for the general good. This day already dawns. But \na little while, and although, without incurring the pity of their \nfellows, men may die sharers in great business enterprises from \nwhich their capital cannot be or has not been withdrawn, and \nis left chiefly at death for public uses, yet the man who dies \nleaving behind him millions of available wealth, which was his \nto administer during life, will pass away \u201cunwept, unhonored, \nand unsung,\u201d no matter to what uses he leaves the dross which \nhe cannot take with him. Of such as these the public verdict will \nthen be: \u201cThe man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\u201d\n \nSuch, in my opinion, is the true Gospel concerning Wealth, \nobedience to which is destined someday to solve the problem of \nthe Rich and the Poor, and to bring \u201cPeace on earth, among men \nGood Will.\u201d\n\n\n\n16\n\n     he reception given to the first \npaper upon this subject, to which our lamented friend, the  \nlate editor and proprietor of this Review, was pleased to give  \nthe first place in the June number, has been most encouraging \nto its author, as it would surely have been to the editor had  \nhe been spared, for he was most deeply interested in the subject. \nAs showing the unflagging attention which Mr. Rice bestowed \nupon his editorial duties, it may be permissible to tell that  \nthe manuscript reached him in the morning, and late in the \nevening of the same day he called to say that it pleased him so \nmuch that he had determined to publish it in the forthcoming \nnumber, instead of holding it for the succeeding issue, as  \nhad been intended. When urged to delay publication, that \nproper time might be given for revision, he declined. Had he \ncomplied, another than he, alas! would have had to stand \nsponsor for my thoughts. Only one short week, and our friend \nwas at rest; his warfare o\u2019er. He had played his part in life  \nwell; and yet how little is he, or is anyone, missed upon the \nmarch! The race presses slowly on as before; another rises  \nto take the vacant place; The North American Review shines on,  \na lamp still burning, to show the great army of humanity the \npitfalls which it must avoid in order to retain what has been \nalready conquered, and to light the paths which that army must \ntread on its way to future conquests. In the death of Mr. Rice  \n\n II. \nTHE BEST FIELDS FOR PHILANTHROPY\n\n\n\n17THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nwe have another proof that in the progress of humanity persons \nare little or nothing; the race is all.\n\n The Individual withers, and the world is more and more.\n\nAnd yet it is much to me that probably the last manuscript our \nfriend read, valued, and published was \u201cWealth.\u201d Perhaps your \nreaders will pardon me for recalling an incident connected with \nour last interview. Sitting in my library, Mr. Rice expressed \na wish to hear the author read his manuscript. I read and he \nlistened from beginning to end, making but one interruption. \nWhen the passage was read which stated that, of every thousand \ndollars spent today in so-called charity, probably nine hundred \nwas unwisely spent, he exclaimed, \u201cYes, nine hundred and fifty! \nMake it nine hundred and fifty!\u201d and it was so made. I cannot \npass without paying a tribute to Allen Thorndike Rice. That I \nknew him is one of the sources from which sweet remembrances \nspring at times, when free from the roar and bustle of life.\n\nWhile \u201cWealth\u201d has thus met a cordial reception upon this side \nof the Atlantic, it is natural that in the motherland it should \nhave attracted most attention, because the older civilization is at \npresent brought more clearly face to face with socialistic ques-\ntions. The contrast between the classes and the masses, between \nrich and poor, is not yet quite so sharp in this vast, fertile, and \ndeveloping continent, with less than twenty persons per square \nmile, as in crowded little Britain, with fifteen times that number \nand no territory unoccupied. Perhaps the Pall Mall Gazette in \nits issue of September 5 puts most pithily the objections that \nhave been raised to what the English have been pleased to call \nthe \u201cGospel of Wealth.\u201d It says:\n\nGreat fortunes, says Mr. Carnegie, are great blessings to \na community, because such and such things may be done \nwith them. Well, but they are also a great curse, for such \n\n\n\n18\n\nand such things are done with them. Mr. Carnegie\u2019s preach-\ning, in other words, is altogether vitiated by Mr. Benzon\u2019s \npractice. The \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d is killed by the acts.\n\nTo this the reply seems obvious: the gospel of Christianity is also \nkilled by the acts. The same objection that is urged against the \ngospel of wealth lies against the commandment \u201cThou shalt not \nsteal.\u201d It is no argument against a gospel that it is not lived up \nto; indeed, it is an argument in its favor, for a gospel must be \nhigher than the prevailing standard. It is no argument against \na law that it is broken: in that disobedience lies the reason for \nmaking and maintaining the law; the law which is never to be \nbroken is never required.\n\nUndoubtedly the most notable incident in regard to the \u201cGospel \nof Wealth\u201d is that it was fortunate enough to attract the attention \nof Mr. Gladstone, and brought forth the following note from him:\n\nI have asked Mr. Lloyd Bryce (North American Review) \nkindly to allow the republication in this country of the \nextremely interesting article on \u201cWealth,\u201d by Mr. Andrew \nCarnegie, which has just appeared in America.\n\nIt is no argument against a \ngospel that it is not lived up to; \nindeed, it is an argument in  \nits favor, for a gospel must be \nhigher than the prevailing \nstandard.\n\n\n\n19THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nThis resulted in the publication of the article in several newspa-\npers and periodicals, and an enterprising publisher issued it in \npamphlet form. It is now sold in Britain for a penny.\n\nAll this is most encouraging, proving, as it does, that society is \nalive to the great issue involved, and is in a receptive mood. Your \nrequest, Mr. Editor, that I should continue the subject and point \nout the best fields for the use of surplus wealth may be taken as \nfurther proof that whether the ideas promulgated are to be \nreceived or rejected, they are at least certain to obtain a hearing.\n\nBefore entering upon the question which you have proposed, \nit may be advantageous to restate the positions taken in the \nformer paper, for the benefit of those who may not have read \nit, or who cannot conveniently refer to it. It was assumed that \nthe present laws of competition, accumulation, and distribution \nare the best obtainable conditions; that through these the race \nreceives its most valuable fruits; and, therefore, that they should \nbe accepted and upheld. Under these it was held that great \nwealth must inevitably flow into the hands of the few excep-\ntional managers of men. The question then arose, What should \nthese do with their surplus wealth? and the \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d \ncontended that surplus wealth should be considered as a sacred \ntrust, to be administered during the lives of its owners, by them \nas trustees, for the best good of the community in which and \nfrom which it had been acquired.\n\nIt was pointed out that there were but three modes of disposing \nof surplus wealth, and two of these were held to be improper. \nFirst, it was held that to leave great fortunes to children did not \nprove true affection for them or interest in their genuine good, \nregarded either as individuals or as members of the state; that it \nwas not the welfare of the children, but the pride of the parents, \nwhich inspired enormous legacies, and that, looking to the usual \nresults of vast sums conferred upon children, the thoughtful \n\n\n\n20\n\nman must be forced to say, if the good of the child only were \nconsidered: \u201cI would as soon leave to my son a curse as to leave \nto him the almighty dollar.\u201d\n\nThe second mode open to men is to hoard their surplus wealth \nduring life, and leave it at death for public uses. It was pointed \nout that in many cases these bequests become merely monu-\nments of the testators\u2019 folly; that the amount of real good done \nby posthumous gifts was ridiculously disproportionate to the \nsums thus left. The recent decision upon Mr. Tilden\u2019s will, \nwhich is said to have been drawn by the ablest of lawyers, and \nthe partial failure of Mr. Williamson\u2019s purposes in regard to \nthe great technical school which that millionaire intended to \nestablish in Philadelphia, are lessons indeed for the rich who \nonly bequeath.\n\nThe aim of the first article was thus to lead up to the conclusion \nthat there is but one right mode of using enormous fortunes\u2014\nnamely, that the possessors from time to time during their own \nlives should so administer them as to promote the permanent \ngood of the communities from which they have been gathered. It \nwas held that public sentiment would soon say of one who died \npossessed of millions of available wealth which he might have \nadministered: \u201cThe man who dies thus rich dies disgraced.\u201d\n \nThe purpose of this article is to present some of the best meth-\nods of performing this duty of administering surplus wealth for \nthe good of the people. The first requisite for a really good use \nof wealth by the millionaire who has accepted the gospel which \nproclaims him only a trustee of the surplus that comes to him, \nis to take care that the purpose for which he spends it shall not \nhave a degrading, pauperizing tendency upon its recipients, and \nthat his trust should be so administered as to stimulate the best \nand most aspiring poor of the community to further efforts for \ntheir own improvement. It is not the irreclaimably destitute, \n\n\n\n21THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nshiftless, and worthless that it is truly beneficial or truly benev-\nolent to attempt to reach and improve. For these there exists \nthe refuge provided by the city or the state, where they can be \nsheltered, fed, clothed, and kept in comfortable existence, and\u2014\nmost important of all\u2014where they can be isolated from the well \ndoing and industrious poor, who are liable to be demoralized \nby contact with these unfortunates. One man or woman who \nsucceeds in living comfortably by begging is more dangerous \nto society, and a greater obstacle to the progress of humanity, \nthan a score of wordy Socialists. The individual administrator of \nsurplus wealth has as his charge the industrious and ambitious; \nnot those who need everything done for them, but those who, \nbeing most anxious and able to help themselves, deserve and \nwill be benefited by help from others and the extension of their \nopportunities at the hands of the philanthropic rich.\n\nIt is ever to be remembered that one of the chief obstacles which \nthe philanthropist meets in his efforts to do real and permanent \ngood in this world is the practice of indiscriminate giving; and \nthe duty of the millionaire is to resolve to cease giving to objects \nthat are not proved clearly to his satisfaction to be deserving. He \nmust remember Mr. Rice\u2019s belief, that nine hundred and fifty \nout of every thousand dollars bestowed today upon so-called \ncharity had better be thrown into the sea. As far as my experience \nof the wealthy extends, it is unnecessary to urge them to give of \ntheir superabundance in charity so called. Greater good for the \nrace is to be achieved by inducing them to cease impulsive and \ninjurious giving. As a rule, the sins of millionaires in this respect \nare not those of omission, but of commission, because they will \nnot take time to think, and chiefly because it is much easier to \ngive than to refuse. Those who have surplus wealth give millions \nevery year which produce more evil than good, and which really \nretard the progress of the people, because most of the forms in \nvogue today for benefiting mankind only tend to spread among \nthe poor a spirit of dependence upon alms, when what is \n\n\n\n22\n\nessential for progress is that they should be inspired to depend \nupon their own exertions. The miser millionaire who hoards his \nwealth does less injury to society than the careless millionaire \nwho squanders his unwisely, even if he does so under cover  \nof the mantle of sacred charity. The man who gives to the \nindividual beggar commits a grave offence, but there are many \nsocieties and institutions soliciting alms which it is none the \nless injurious to the community to aid. These are as corrupting \nas individual beggars. Plutarch\u2019s Morals contains this lesson:  \n\u201cA beggar asking an alms of a Lacedaemonian, he said: \u2018Well, \nshould I give thee anything, thou wilt be the greater beggar, for \nhe that first gave thee money made thee idle, and is the cause  \nof this base and dishonorable way of living.\u2019\u201d As I know them, \nthere are few millionaires, very few indeed, who are clear of  \nthis sin of having made beggars.\n\nBearing in mind these considerations, let us endeavor to present \nsome of the best uses to which a millionaire can devote the \nsurplus of which he should regard himself as only the trustee.\n\nFIRST \u2014 Standing apart by itself there is the founding of a \nuniversity by men enormously rich, such men as must necessar-\nily be few in any country. Perhaps the greatest sum ever given \nby an individual for any purpose is the gift of Senator Stanford, \nwho undertakes to establish upon the Pacific coast, where he \namassed his enormous fortune, a complete university, which is \nsaid to involve the expenditure of ten millions of dollars, and \nupon which he may be expected to bestow twenty millions of his \nsurplus. He is to be envied. A thousand years hence some orator, \nspeaking his praise upon the then crowded shores of the Pacific, \nmay repeat Griffith\u2019s eulogy of Wolsey, \u201cIn bestowing he was \nmost princely: ever witness for him this great seat of learning.\u201d \nHere is a noble use of wealth.\n\n\n\n23THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nWe have many such institutions, Hopkins, Cornell, Packer, and \nothers, but most of these have only been bequeathed, and it is \nimpossible to extol any man greatly for simply leaving what he \ncannot take with him. Cooper, and Pratt, and Stanford, and \nothers of this class deserve credit and the admiration of their \nfellows as much for the time and the attention given during their \nlives, as for their expenditure, upon their respective monuments.\n\nWe cannot have the Pacific coast in mind without recalling \nanother important work of a different character which has \nrecently been established there, the Lick Observatory. If any \nmillionaire be interested in the ennobling study of astronomy\u2014\nand there should be and would be such if they but gave the \nsubject the slightest attention\u2014here is an example which could \nwell be followed, for the progress made in astronomical instru-\nments and appliances is so great and continuous that every few \nyears a new telescope might be judiciously given to one of the \nobservatories upon this continent, the last being always the \nlargest and the best, and certain to carry further and further the \nknowledge of the universe and of our relation to it here upon the \nearth. As one among many of the good deeds of the late Mr. \nThaw, of Pittsburgh, his constant support of the observatory \nthere may be mentioned. This observatory enabled Professor \nLangley to make his wonderful discoveries. The professor is now \nat the head of the Smithsonian Institution, a worthy successor to \nProfessor Henry. Connected with him was Mr. Brashear, of \nPittsburgh, whose instruments are in most of the principal \nobservatories of the world. He was a common millwright, but \nMr. Thaw recognized his genius and was his main support \nthrough trying days. This common workman has been made a \nprofessor by one of the foremost scientific bodies of the world. In \napplying part of his surplus in aiding these two now famous men, \nthe millionaire Thaw did a noble work. Their joint labors have \n\n\n\n24\n\nbrought great, and are destined to bring still greater, credit upon \ntheir country in every scientific center throughout the world.\n\nIt is reserved for very few to found universities, and, indeed, \nthe use for many, or perhaps any, new universities does not \nexist. More good is henceforth to be accomplished by adding \nto and extending those in existence. But in this department a \nwide field remains for the millionaire as distinguished from the \nCroesus among millionaires. The gifts to Yale University have \nbeen many, but there is plenty of room for others. The School of \nFine Arts, founded by Mr. Street, the Sheffield Scientific School, \nendowed by Mr. Sheffield, and Professor Loomis\u2019s fund for the \nobservatory, are fine examples. Mrs. C. J. Osborne\u2019s building for \nreading and recitation is to be regarded with especial pleasure \nas being the wise gift of a woman. Harvard University has not \nbeen forgotten; the Peabody Museum, and the halls of Wells, \nMatthews, and Thayer may be cited. Sever Hall is worthy  \nof special mention, as showing what a genius like Richardson \ncould do with the small sum of a hundred thousand dollars. \nThe Vanderbilt University at Nashville, Tennessee, may be \nmentioned as a true product of the gospel of wealth. It was \nestablished by members of the Vanderbilt family during their \nlives\u2014mark this vital feature\u2014during their lives; for nothing \ncounts for much that is left by a man at his death. Such funds \nare torn from him, not given by him. If any millionaire is at  \na loss to know how to accomplish great and indisputable good \nwith his surplus, here is a field which can never be fully  \noccupied, for the wants of our universities increase with the \ndevelopment of the country.\n\nSECOND \u2014 The result of my own study of the question, What \nis the best gift which can be given to a community? is that a free \nlibrary occupies the first place, provided the community will \naccept and maintain it as a public institution, as much a part of \nthe city property as its public schools, and, indeed, an adjunct \n\n\n\n25THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nto these. It is, no doubt, possible that my own personal expe-\nrience may have led me to value a free library beyond all other \nforms of beneficence. When I was a boy in Pittsburgh, Colonel \nAnderson, of Allegheny\u2014a name I can never speak without \nfeelings of devotional gratitude\u2014opened his little library of four \nhundred books to boys. Every Saturday afternoon he was in \nattendance himself at his house to exchange books. No one but \nhe who has felt it can know the intense longing with which the \narrival of Saturday was awaited, that a new book might be had. \nMy brother and Mr. Phipps, who have been my principal busi-\nness partners through life, shared with me Colonel Anderson\u2019s \nprecious generosity, and it was when reveling in these treasures \nthat I resolved, if ever wealth came to me, that it should be used \nto establish free libraries, that other poor boys might receive \nopportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to \nthat noble man.\n\nGreat Britain has been foremost in appreciating the value of free \nlibraries for its people. Parliament passed an act permitting \ntowns and cities to establish and maintain these as municipal \ninstitutions, and whenever the people of any town or city voted \nto accept the provisions of the act, the authorities were authorized \nto tax the community to the extent of one penny in the pound \n\nThe result of my own study of the question, \nWhat is the best gift which can be given  \nto a community? is that a free library occupies \nthe first place\u2026. It is, no doubt, possible  \nthat my own personal experience may have  \nled me to value a free library beyond all  \nother forms of beneficence.\n\n\n\n26\n\nvaluation. Most of the towns already have free libraries under \nthis act. Many of these are the gifts of rich men, whose funds \nhave been used for the building, and in some cases for the books \nalso, the communities being required to maintain and to develop \nthe libraries; and to this feature I attribute most of their useful-\nness. An endowed institution is liable to become the prey of a \nclique. The public ceases to take interest in it, or, rather, never \nacquires interest in it. The rule has been violated which requires \nthe recipients to help themselves. Everything has been done for \nthe community instead of its being only helped to help itself.\n\nMany free libraries have been established in our country, but \nnone that I know of with such wisdom as the Pratt Library, \nof Baltimore. Mr. Pratt presented to the city of Baltimore \none million dollars, requiring it to pay 5 percent, per annum, \namounting to fifty thousand dollars per year, which is to be \ndevoted to the maintenance and development of the library and \nits branches. During last year 430,217 books were distributed; \n37,196 people of Baltimore are registered upon the books as \nreaders; and it is safe to say that the 37,000 frequenters of the \nPratt Library are of more value to Baltimore, to the State, and \nto the country than all the inert, lazy, and hopelessly poor in the \nwhole nation. And it may further be safely said that, by placing \nwithin the reach of 37,000 aspiring people books which they \nwere anxious to obtain, Mr. Pratt has done more for the genuine \nprogress of the people than has been done by all the contribu-\ntions of all the millionaires and rich people to help those who \ncannot help themselves. The one wise administrator of his \nsurplus has poured his fertilizing stream upon soil that was \nready to receive it and return a hundred-fold. The many squan-\nderers have not only poured their streams into sieves which \nnever can be filled\u2014they have done worse; they have poured \nthem into stagnant sewers that breed the diseases which afflict \nthe body politic. And this is not all. The million dollars of which \nMr. Pratt has made so grand a use are something, but there \n\n\n\n27THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nis something greater still. When the fifth branch library was \nopened in Baltimore, the speaker said:\n\nWhatever may have been done in these four years, it was  \nhis pleasure to acknowledge that much, very much, was  \ndue to the earnest interest, the wise councils, and the \npractical suggestions of Mr. Pratt. He never seemed to feel \nthat the mere donation of great wealth for the benefit of  \nhis fellow citizens was all that would be asked of him, but  \nhe wisely labored to make its application as comprehensive \nand effective as possible. Thus he constantly lightened \nburdens that were, at times, very heavy, brought good cheer \nand bright sunshine when clouds flitted across the sky,  \nand made every officer and employee feel that good work \nwas appreciated, and loyal devotion to duty would receive  \nhearty commendation.\n\nThis is the finest picture I have ever seen of any of the million-\naire class. As here depicted, Mr. Pratt is the ideal disciple of the \n\u201cGospel of Wealth.\u201d We need have no fear that the mass of toil-\ners will fail to recognize in such as he their best leaders and their \nmost invaluable allies; for the problem of poverty and wealth, of \nemployer and employed, will be practically solved whenever the \ntime of the few is given, and their wealth is administered during \ntheir lives, for the best good of that portion of the community \nwhich has not been burdened by the responsibilities which \nattend the possession of wealth. We shall have no antagonism \nbetween classes when that day comes, for the high and the low, \nthe rich and the poor, shall then indeed be brothers.\n\nNo millionaire will go far wrong in his search for one of the \nbest forms for the use of his surplus who chooses to establish \na free library in any community that is willing to maintain and \ndevelop it. John Bright\u2019s words should ring in his ear: \u201cIt is \nimpossible for any man to bestow a greater benefit upon a young \nman than to give him access to books in a free library.\u201d Closely \n\n\n\n28\n\nallied to the library, and, where possible, attached to it, there \nshould be rooms for an art gallery and museum, and a hall for \nsuch lectures and instruction as are provided in the Cooper \nUnion. The traveler upon the Continent is surprised to find that \nevery town of importance has its art gallery and museum; these \nmay be large or small, but in any case each has a receptacle \nfor the treasures of the locality, which is constantly receiving \nvaluable gifts and bequests. The free library and art gallery \nof Birmingham are remarkable among these, and every now \nand then a rich man adds to their value by presenting books, \nfine pictures, or other works of art. All that our cities require \nto begin with is a proper fireproof building. Their citizens who \ntravel will send to it rare and costly things from every quarter of \nthe globe they visit, while those who remain at home will give \nor bequeath to it of their treasures. In this way these collec-\ntions will grow until our cities will ultimately be able to boast of \npermanent exhibitions from which their own citizens will derive \nincalculable benefit, and which they will be proud to show to \nvisitors. In The Metropolitan Museum of Art in this city we have \nmade an excellent beginning. Here is another avenue for the \nproper use of surplus wealth.\n \nTHIRD \u2014 We have another most important department in which \ngreat sums can be worthily used\u2014the founding or extension of \nhospitals, medical colleges, laboratories, and other institutions \nconnected with the alleviation of human suffering, and especially \nwith the prevention rather than the cure of human ills. There is \nno danger of pauperizing a community in giving for such \npurposes, because such institutions relieve temporary ailments \nor shelter only those who are hopeless invalids. What better gift \nthan a hospital can be given to a community that is without \none?\u2014the gift being conditioned upon its proper maintenance by \nthe community in its corporate capacity. If hospital accommoda-\ntion already exists, no better method for using surplus wealth \ncan be found than in making additions to it. The late Mr. \n\n\n\n29THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nVanderbilt\u2019s gift of half a million of dollars to the medical \ndepartment of Columbia College for a chemical laboratory was \none of the wisest possible uses of wealth. It strikes at the preven-\ntion of disease by penetrating into its causes. Several others have \nestablished such laboratories, but the need for them is still great.\n\nIf there be a millionaire in the land who is at a loss what to do \nwith the surplus that has been committed to him as trustee, let \nhim investigate the good that is flowing from these chemical \nlaboratories. No medical college is complete without its labora-\ntory. As with universities, so with medical colleges; it is not new \ninstitutions that are required, but additional means for the more \nthorough equipment of those that exist. The forms that benefac-\ntions to these may wisely take are numerous, but probably none \nis more useful than that adopted by Mr. Osborn when he built a \nschool for training female nurses at Bellevue College. If from all \ngifts there flows one half of the good that comes from this wise \nuse of a millionaire\u2019s surplus, the most exacting may well be \nsatisfied. Only those who have passed through a lingering and \ndangerous illness can rate at their true value the care, skill, and \nattendance of trained female nurses. Their employment as nurses \nhas enlarged the sphere and influence of woman. It is not to be \nwondered at that a Senator of the United States and a physician \ndistinguished in this country for having received the highest \ndistinctions abroad should find their wives from this class.\n\nFOURTH \u2014 In the very front rank of benefactions public parks \nshould be placed, always provided that the community under-\ntakes to maintain, beautify, and preserve inviolate the parks \ngiven to it. No more useful or more beautiful monument can be \nleft by any man than a park for the city in which he was born \nor in which he has long lived, nor can the community pay a \nmore graceful tribute to the citizen who presents it than to give \nhis name to the gift. If a park be already provided, there is still \nroom for many judicious gifts in connection with it. Mr. Phipps, \n\n\n\n30\n\nof Allegheny, has given conservatories to the park there, which \nare visited by many every day of the week and crowded by thou-\nsands of working people every Sunday, for, with rare wisdom, \nhe has stipulated as a condition of the gift that the conservato-\nries shall be open on Sundays. The result of his experiment has \nbeen so gratifying that he is justified in adding to them from his \nsurplus, as he is doing largely this year. To any lover of flowers \namong the wealthy I commend a study of what is possible for \nthem to do in the line of Mr. Phipps\u2019s example; and may they \nplease note that Mr. Phipps is a wise as well as a liberal giver, \nfor he requires the city to maintain these conservatories, and \nthus secures for them forever the public ownership, the public \ninterest, and the public criticism of their management. Had he \nundertaken to manage and maintain them, it is probable that \npopular interest in the gift would never have been awakened.\n\nThe parks and pleasure grounds of small towns throughout \nEurope are not less surprising than their libraries, museums, \nand art galleries. We saw nothing more pleasing during our \nrecent travels than the hillside of Bergen, in Norway. It has been \nconverted into one of the most picturesque of pleasure grounds; \nfountains, cascades, waterfalls, delightful arbors, fine terraces, \nand statues adorn what was before a barren mountainside.  \nHere is a field worthy of study by the millionaire who would \nconfer a lasting benefit upon his fellows. Another beautiful \ninstance of the right use of wealth in the direction of making \ncities more and more attractive we found in Dresden. The owner \nof the leading paper there bequeathed its revenues forever to \nthe city, to be used in beautifying it. An art committee decides \nfrom time to time what new artistic feature is to be introduced \nor what hideous feature is to be changed, and as the revenues \naccrue they are expended in this direction. Thus through the gift \nof this patriotic newspaper proprietor his native city of Dresden \nis fast becoming one of the most artistic places of residence in \nthe whole world. A work having been completed, it devolves \n\n\n\n31THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nupon the city to maintain it forever. May I be excused if I \ncommend to our millionaire newspaper proprietors the example \nof their colleague in the capital of Saxony?\n\nScarcely a city of any magnitude in the older countries is without \nmany structures and features of great beauty. Much has been \nspent upon ornament, decoration, and architectural effect: we \nare still far behind in these things upon this side of the Atlantic. \nOur Republic is great in some things\u2014in material development \nunrivaled; but let us always remember that in art and in the \nfiner touches we have scarcely yet taken a place. Had the exqui-\nsite memorial arch recently erected temporarily in New York \nbeen shown in Dresden, the art committee there would probably \nhave been enabled, from the revenue of the newspaper given by \nits owner for just such purposes, to order its permanent erection \nto adorn the city forever.\n\nWhile the bestowal of a park upon a community as one of the \nbest uses for surplus wealth will be universally approved, in \nembracing such additions to it as conservatories, or in advocat-\ning the building of memorial arches and works of adornment, \nit is probable that many will think we go too far, and consider \nthese somewhat fanciful. The material good to flow from them \nmay not be so directly visible; but let not any practical mind, \nintent only upon material good, depreciate the value of wealth \ngiven for these or for kindred aesthetic purposes as being \nuseless as far as the mass of the people and their needs are \nconcerned. As with libraries and museums, so with these more \ndistinctively artistic works; these perform their great use when \nthey reach the best of the masses of the people. It is worth more \nto reach and touch the sentiment for beauty in the naturally \nbright minds of this class than that those incapable of being so \ntouched should be pandered to. For what the improver of the \nrace must endeavor to do is to reach those who have the divine \nspark ever so feebly developed, that it may be strengthened and \n\n\n\n32\n\ngrow. For my part, I think Mr. Phipps put his money to better \nuse in giving the workingmen of Allegheny conservatories filled \nwith beautiful flowers, orchids, and aquatic plants, which they, \nwith their wives and children, can enjoy in their spare hours, \nand on which they can feed the love for the beautiful, than if he \nhad given his surplus money to furnish them with bread, for \nthose in health who cannot earn their bread are scarcely worth \nconsidering by the individual giver; the care of such being the \nduty of the state. The man who erects in a city a truly artistic \narch, statue, or fountain makes a wise use of his surplus. \u201cMan \ndoes not live by bread alone.\u201d\n\nFIFTH \u2014 We have another good use for surplus wealth, in \nproviding for our cities halls suitable for meetings of all kinds, \nespecially for concerts of elevating music. Our cities are rarely \nprovided with halls for these purposes, being in this respect \nalso very far behind European cities. The Springer Hall, of \nCincinnati, that valuable addition to the city, was largely the gift \nof Mr. Springer, who was not content to bequeath funds from \nhis estate at death, but who gave during his life, and, in addition, \ngave\u2014what was equally important\u2014his time and business abil-\nity to ensure the successful results which have been achieved. \nThe gift of a hall to any city lacking one is an excellent use for \nsurplus wealth for the good of a community. The reason why the \npeople have only one instructive and elevating, or even amus-\ning, entertainment when a dozen would be highly beneficial, is \nthat the rent of a hall, even when a suitable hall exists (which is \nrare), is so great as to prevent managers from running the risk \nof financial failure. If every city in our land owned a hall which \ncould be given or rented for a small sum for such gatherings as \na committee or the mayor of the city judged advantageous, the \npeople could be furnished with proper lectures, amusements, \nand concerts at an exceedingly small cost. The town halls of \nEuropean cities, many of which have organs, are of inestimable \nvalue to the people, when utilized as they are in the manner \n\n\n\n33THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nsuggested. Let no one underrate the influence of entertainments \nof an elevating or even of an amusing character, for these do \nmuch to make the lives of the people happier and their natures \nbetter. If any millionaire born in a small village, which has now \nbecome a great city, is prompted in the day of his success to do \nsomething for his birthplace with part of his surplus, his grateful \nremembrance cannot take a form more useful than that of a \npublic hall with an organ, provided the city agrees to maintain \nand use it.\n\nSIXTH \u2014 In another respect we are still much behind Europe. A \nform of beneficence which is not uncommon there is providing \nswimming baths for the people. The donors of these have been \nwise enough to require the city benefited to maintain them at \nits own expense, and as proof of the contention that everything \nshould never be done for anyone or for any community, but \nthat the recipients should invariably be called upon to do part, \nit is significant that it is found essential for the popular success \nof these healthful establishments to exact a nominal charge for \ntheir use. In many cities, however, the schoolchildren are admit-\nted free at fixed hours upon certain days, different hours being \nfixed for the boys and the girls to use the great swimming baths, \nhours or days being also fixed for the use of these baths by \nladies. In inland cities the young of both sexes are thus taught to \nswim. Swimming clubs are organized, and matches are frequent, \nat which medals and prizes are given. The reports published by \nthe various swimming baths throughout Great Britain are filled \nwith instances of lives saved because those who fortunately \nescaped shipwreck had been taught to swim in the baths, and \nnot a few instances are given in which the pupils of certain bath-\ning establishments have saved the lives of others. If any disciple \nof the \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d gives his favorite city large swimming \nand private baths (provided the municipality undertakes their \nmanagement as a city affair), he will never be called to account \nfor an improper use of the funds entrusted to him.\n\n\n\n34\n\nSEVENTH \u2014 Churches as fields for the use of surplus wealth \nhave purposely been reserved until the last, because, these \nbeing sectarian, every man will be governed by his own attach-\nments; therefore gifts to churches, it may be said, are not, in \none sense, gifts to the community at large, but to special classes. \nNevertheless, every millionaire may know of a district where the \nlittle cheap, uncomfortable, and altogether unworthy wooden \nstructure stands at the crossroads, to which the whole neighbor-\nhood gathers on Sunday, and which is the center of social life \nand source of neighborly feeling. The administrator of wealth \nhas made a good use of part of his surplus if he replaces that \nbuilding with a permanent structure of brick, stone, or gran-\nite, up the sides of which the honeysuckle and columbine may \nclimb, and from whose tower the sweet-tolling bell may sound. \nThe millionaire should not figure how cheaply this structure can \nbe built, but how perfect it can be made. If he has the money, \nit should be made a gem, for the educating influence of a pure \nand noble specimen of architecture, built, as the pyramids were \nbuilt, to stand for ages, is not to be measured by dollars. Every \nfarmer\u2019s home, heart, and mind in the district will be influenced \nby the beauty and grandeur of the church. But having given the \nbuilding, the donor should stop there; the support of the church \nshould be upon its own people; there is not much genuine reli-\ngion in the congregation or much good to flow from the church \nwhich is not supported at home.\n\nMany other avenues for the wise expenditure of surplus wealth \nmight be indicated. I enumerate but a few\u2014a very few\u2014of the \nmany fields which are open, and only those in which great or \nconsiderable sums can be judiciously used. It is not the privi-\nlege, however, of millionaires alone to work for or aid measures \nwhich are certain to benefit the community. Everyone who has \nbut a small surplus above his moderate wants may share this \nprivilege with his richer brothers, and those without surplus can \ngive at least part of their time, which is usually as important as \n\n\n\n35THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\nfunds, and often more so. Someday, perhaps, with your permis-\nsion, I will endeavor to point out some fields and modes in \nwhich these may perform well their part as trustees of wealth or \nleisure, according to the measure of their respective fortunes.\n\nIt is not expected, neither is it desirable, that there should be \na general concurrence as to the best possible use of surplus \nwealth. For different men and different localities there are \ndifferent uses. What commends itself most highly to the judg-\nment of the administrator is the best use for him, for his heart \nshould be in the work. It is as important in administering wealth \nas it is in any other branch of a man\u2019s work that he should be \nenthusiastically devoted to it and feel that in the field selected \nhis work lies.\n\nBesides this, there is room and need for all kinds of wise bene-\nfactions for the commonweal. The man who builds a univer-\nsity, library, or laboratory performs no more useful work than \nhe who elects to devote himself and his surplus means to the \nadornment of a park, the gathering together of a collection of \npictures for the public, or the building of a memorial arch. These \nare all true laborers in the vineyard. The only point required by \n\nIt is not the privilege, however, of millionaires \nalone to work for or aid measures which are \ncertain to benefit the community. Everyone who \nhas but a small surplus above his moderate \nwants may share this privilege with his richer \nbrothers, and those without surplus can give \nat least part of their time, which is usually as \nimportant as funds, and often more so.\n\n\n\n36\n\nthe \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d is that the surplus which accrues from \ntime to time in the hands of a man should be administered by \nhim in his own lifetime for that purpose which is seen by him,  \nas trustee, to be best for the good of the people. To leave at \ndeath what he cannot take away, and place upon others the \nburden of the work which it was his own duty to perform, is to \ndo nothing worthy. This requires no sacrifice, nor any sense of \nduty to his fellows.\n\nTime was when the words concerning the rich man entering \nheaven were regarded as a hard saying. Today, when all  \nquestions are probed to the bottom and the standards of faith \nreceive the most liberal interpretations, the startling verse has \nbeen relegated to the rear, to await the next kindly revision as \none of those things which cannot be quite understood, but \nwhich meanwhile\u2014it is carefully to be observed\u2014are not to be \nunderstood literally. But is it so very improbable that the next \nstage of thought is not to restore the doctrine in all its pristine \npurity and force, as being in perfect harmony with sound ideas \nupon the subject of wealth and poverty, the rich and the poor, \nand the contrasts everywhere seen and deplored? In Christ\u2019s \nday, it is evident, reformers were against the wealthy. It is none \nthe less evident that we are fast recurring to that position today; \nand there will be nothing to surprise the student of sociological \ndevelopment if society should soon approve the text which has \n\nThe only point required by the \u201cGospel of \nWealth\u201d is that the surplus which accrues from \ntime to time in the hands of a man should be \nadministered by him in his own lifetime for  \nthat purpose which is seen by him, as trustee,  \nto be best for the good of the people.\n\n\n\n37THE GOSPEL OF WEALTH\n\ncaused so much anxiety: \u201cIt is easier for a camel to enter the  \neye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of \nHeaven.\u201d Even if the needle were the small casement at the \ngates, the words betoken serious difficulty for the rich. It will be \nbut a step for the theologian to take from the doctrine that he \nwho dies rich dies disgraced to that which brings upon the man \npunishment or deprivation hereafter.\n\nThe \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d but echoes Christ\u2019s words. It calls upon \nthe millionaire to sell all that he hath and give it in the highest \nand best form to the poor, by administering his estate himself \nfor the good of his fellows, before he is called upon to lie down \nand rest upon the bosom of Mother Earth. So doing, he will \napproach his end no longer the ignoble hoarder of useless \nmillions, poor, very poor indeed, in money, but rich, very rich, \ntwenty times a millionaire still, in the affection, gratitude,  \nand admiration of his fellow men, and\u2014sweeter far\u2014soothed \nand sustained by the still small voice within, which, whispering, \ntells him that, because he has lived, perhaps one small part  \nof the great world has been bettered just a little. This much is \nsure: against such riches as these no bar will be found at the \nGates of Paradise.\n\n\n\n38\n\nABOUT ANDREW CARNEGIE\n\nBorn in Dunfermline, Scotland, on November 25, 1835, Andrew Carnegie \nwas the first son of Margaret and William Carnegie, a linen weaver and \nlocal leader of the Chartists (who sought to improve the conditions of work-\ning-class life in Great Britain).\n\nThe Carnegie family immigrated to the United States in 1848, settling in \nAllegheny, Pennsylvania. There, at the age of thirteen, Andrew began his \ncareer as a bobbin boy in a cotton factory. A voracious reader who could \nnot afford books in his native Scotland, Carnegie took advantage of the \ngenerosity of an Allegheny citizen who opened his library to local working \nboys. Books provided most of his education as he moved from factory  \nboy to telegraph operator, and then on to a series of positions leading to \nthat of superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nWhile still employed by the railroad\nThe file is too long and its contents have been truncated.\n", "title": "gospel_of_wealth_2017.pdf", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"command": "context_stuff", "is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "aaa2081c-7c77-4e06-abe7-ddfb9738dcbe", "request_id": "87dd38b4accc4bde-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "aaa2081c-7c77-4e06-abe7-ddfb9738dcbe", "children": ["88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70"]}, "88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70": {"id": "88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70", "message": {"id": "88c4ad25-6926-49f6-996a-d187abd8bb70", "author": {"role": "tool", "name": "myfiles_browser", "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714707566.926264, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["\nPlease remember to search the user&#x27;s documents if an answer to their question is not contained in the above snippets.\n"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "default_model_slug": "gpt-4", "pad": "AAA", "parent_id": "c1ab741b-88de-4cb6-9c5f-36ce6261ab34", "request_id": "87dd38b4accc4bde-MXP", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c1ab741b-88de-4cb6-9c5f-36ce6261ab34", "children": ["cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf"]}, "cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf": {"id": "cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf", "message": {"id": "cd1cd280-3c0d-4f8f-85c1-8450fb2d15bf", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714707566.926455, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["### Outline of &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot;\n\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Overview of the changing conditions of society and the disparities between the rich and poor.\n   - Acknowledgment of the benefits and challenges brought by the accumulation of wealth.\n\n2. **The Responsibilities of Wealth**\n   - Argument that the wealthy are trustees of their riches and should live modestly and use their wealth for the public good.\n   - Critique of those who accumulate wealth only to leave it behind upon death.\n\n3. **Methods of Wealth Distribution**\n   - Criticism of handing down wealth to descendants and the negative impact it can have.\n   - The importance of actively managing wealth to contribute to societal progress during one\u2019s lifetime.\n\n4. **Practical Applications of Wealth**\n   - Examples of effective ways to use wealth, such as funding public parks, libraries, universities, and scientific research.\n   - Encouragement for the wealthy to engage directly in philanthropy and societal improvement.\n\n5. **Conclusion**\n   - Recapitulation of the main thesis: the wealthy must use their fortunes to bridge societal gaps and foster community health.\n\n### Summary\n\nAndrew Carnegie&#x27;s &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot; is a seminal text that outlines his philosophy on the duties of the wealthy, arguing that individuals who accumulate wealth have the responsibility to use it for the greater good of society. He contends that wealth should not simply be inherited by the progeny of the rich nor should it be hoarded until death, but rather actively managed and distributed by the wealthy during their lifetimes.\n\nCarnegie challenges the wealthy to act as stewards of their wealth, using it to promote societal progress and innovation. He proposes practical means through which wealth can be beneficially used, including the establishment of public institutions such as libraries, parks, universities, and research facilities that can provide lasting benefits to communities.\n\n### Key Ideas\n\n- **Trusteeship of Wealth**: Carnegie believes that the rich are merely trustees of their wealth and should use it to promote the general welfare.\n- **Active Philanthropy**: He advocates for a proactive approach to wealth distribution, where the wealthy take an active role in philanthropy rather than merely leaving an inheritance.\n- **Social Benefits**: Carnegie emphasizes the social benefits of wealth distribution, arguing that it can lead to a more equitable and advanced society.\n- **Legacy of Giving**: He encourages the wealthy to leave a legacy of giving that continues to benefit society long after they are gone.\n\n### Relevance to Sustainable Resource Management\n\nCarnegie\u2019s ideas are relevant to sustainable resource management in that they promote the use of surplus wealth for the development of public goods that can lead to sustainable outcomes. His advocacy for the creation of parks, libraries, and universities supports the idea of sustainable communities where resources are used to create lasting social and environmental benefits. The principles he outlines can be applied to modern sustainable practices by encouraging those with the means to invest in renewable resources, conservation efforts, and sustainable technologies, thus ensuring that their wealth contributes to long-term societal resilience and ecological balance."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Two particularly relevant arguments are the concept of wealth as a trust and the critique of bequeathing vast fortunes to descendants.\n\n### 1. Wealth as a Trust\n\n**Carnegie\u2019s Argument:**\nCarnegie argues that the wealthy are merely trustees of their wealth and have the duty to administer it in a way that benefits society. This involves living modestly, providing moderately for one\u2019s dependents, and using the bulk of one&#x27;s resources to address public issues.\n\n**Relation to Modern Philanthropy:**\nThis concept closely aligns with the modern idea of &quot;impact investing&quot; and &quot;strategic philanthropy,&quot; where donors seek to use their wealth to generate specific social or environmental benefits alongside a financial return. Today\u2019s philanthropists, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, explicitly view their wealth as a means to solve global issues, evident in their support for initiatives through the Giving Pledge, where billionaires commit to donating the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes. This reflects Carnegie&#x27;s belief in wealth as a trust for public benefit, demonstrating a continued commitment among many in the elite to manage their wealth responsibly for societal improvement.\n\n### 2. Critique of Bequeathing Wealth to Descendants\n\n**Carnegie\u2019s Argument:**\nCarnegie criticizes the practice of leaving immense wealth to children, suggesting it often does more harm than good. He argues that such inheritances can stifle personal development and lead to a class of idle rich. Instead, he advocates for the use of wealth during one\u2019s lifetime to support public works that provide long-term benefits to society.\n\n**Relation to Modern Philanthropy:**\nWhile some modern wealthy individuals still pass on significant assets to their heirs, there is a growing movement towards limiting such inheritances, as exemplified by the Giving Pledge. Philanthropists today are increasingly concerned about the societal impacts of their wealth and are choosing to allocate their resources to philanthropic funds, foundations, and trusts that address societal issues, rather than to personal fortunes for their descendants. This shift reflects Carnegie\u2019s perspective on the potentially deleterious effects of large inheritances and supports a broader societal trend towards equity and meritocracy.\n\n### Analysis\nCarnegie\u2019s arguments about the trusteeship of wealth and the careful consideration against bequeathing fortunes to descendants have profoundly influenced contemporary views on philanthropy. His advocacy for active, thoughtful philanthropy has laid the groundwork for modern practices that prioritize strategic, impactful giving over mere wealth accumulation or dynastic wealth transfer. However, the degree to which these principles are adopted varies, with some modern billionaires still favoring substantial inheritances over public giving.

To date, however, the study of nonprofit organiza-\ntions has yet to find a home in any single discipline. And this may well\nbe for the best. Our understanding of nonprofit organizations has bene-\nfited from the attention of economists, political scientists, sociologists,\npsychologists, historians, and management scholars. In writing this\nbook, I have endeavored to bring together some of the most significant\nand contentious ideas about the nonprofit and voluntary sector and to\nintegrate at least some elements of the competing disciplinary perspec-\ntives that have emerged. This is, after all, a book about the nonprofit and\nvoluntary sector written by an organizational sociologist who teaches\nstrategic management in a public policy school. It is my sincere hope\nthat this book will cross disciplinary bounds and that it will serve as a\nuseful and clarifying overview of the pressing conceptual and policy\nproblems facing nonprofit organizations today.\n\nDividing nonprofit action into four broad functions, this book exam-\nines how nonprofit organizations promote civic and political engage-\nment, deliver critical services within communities, provide an institu-\ntional vehicle for social entrepreneurship, and allow the expression of\nvalues and faith. The core of the book explores the tensions and prob-\nlems that have arisen in each of these functional realms and the bound-\nary disputes that have broken out as nonprofit organizations have been\ndrawn into competition and collaboration with government and busi-\nness. In exploring the multiple roles of nonprofit organizations, I argue\nthat the long-term health and viability of nonprofit organizations de-\n\nv\n\n\n\npend on the achievement of balance among the four functions, so that\nno one function is allowed to dominate the other three. This has not al-\nways been achieved in recent years and the results have been painfully\nclear: charges of politicization, vendorism, commercialism, and particu-\nlarism have plagued nonprofit organizations. The argument developed\nhere is that only when nonprofits achieve important successes in each of\ntheir functions will they receive and sustain the financial support and\npublic acceptance that they need to continue to grow. In tackling these\nbroad and complex issues, I have aimed to provide a perspective on non-\nprofit activity that will be relevant to scholars and students approaching\nthe topic from a wide array of backgrounds and levels of familiarity.\n\nThe intellectual debts I have accumulated over the years are very\nlarge. From the very first moment I joined the faculty of Harvard Univer-\nsity\u2019s Kennedy School of Government and began to work on this book, I\nhave benefited greatly from the good counsel and insightful criticisms\nof Mark Moore and Christine Letts, who together helped launch the\nHauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, where I have been a faculty\naffiliate. I am grateful to both of them for creating a place where it is pos-\nsible to do serious work within a community of scholars and students.\nMy faculty colleagues at the Hauser Center and within the broader Ken-\nnedy School of Government have all contributed directly or indirectly to\nthe completion of this book. Through numerous seminar presentations,\ne-mail exchanges, and hallway discussions over the years, their active\u2014\nsometimes aggressive\u2014questioning has led me to sharpen and improve\nmy arguments. I owe a special debt to Peter Dobkin Hall, who read and\ncommented on the entire manuscript and generously shared with me his\nencyclopedic knowledge of all things nonprofit. My understanding of\nthe nonprofit sector has been substantially enriched by friendships, con-\nversations, and collaborations over the years with Joseph Galaskiewicz,\nPaul Light, Steven Rathgeb Smith, Brint Milward, Barry Karl, Ellen\nCondliffe Lagemann, Marion Fremont-Smith, Allen Grossman, Eliza-\nbeth Keating, Donald Haider, David Reingold, and William Ryan.\n\nOne of the real pleasures of working at the Kennedy School of Gov-\nernment has been the opportunity to teach and work with a group of su-\nperb doctoral students, including especially Alice Andre-Clark, Gabriel\nKaplan, and Mark Kim. For several years, Kennedy School students in\nmy class on the nonprofit sector patiently listened and questioned me\nas the ideas in this book were formed and developed. From the start,\n\nvi Preface\n\n\n\nShawn Bohen has expertly managed the Hauser Center\u2019s work and\ngrowth and, with great humor and patience, helped me navigate the ser-\npentine world of Harvard rules, regulations, and budgets, while also pro-\nviding the kind of advice and help that was necessary for seeing many\nprojects to completion. Jennifer Johnson provided wonderful research\nassistance throughout the writing of the book and helped bring the\nmanuscript to final form. Michael Aronson at Harvard University Press\nguided this book from an idea to a manuscript, arranged helpful reviews,\npatiently explained the publishing process to me, and made the whole\nprocess appear less mysterious.\n\nBehind the scenes of much of my research, a group of generous sup-\nporters have allowed me to pursue ideas wherever they led. It is a plea-\nsure to thank the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Claude\nRosenberg of NewTithing Group, Patricia Brown of the Burton G.\nBettingen Corporation, Ted Halstead of New America Foundation, and\nMark Abramson of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for the\nBusiness of Government, all of whom supplied critical financial sup-\nport for elements of my broader research agenda. Within the Kennedy\nSchool, Alan Altshuler, Ron Heifetz, and Fred Schauer furthered the\nproject at critical stages, and I am grateful for their help.\n\nFinally, my greatest debt is to my wife, Elizabeth, who encouraged me\nfrom my first day of graduate school and through all my subsequent re-\nsearch. Her unstinting support has made everything seem possible.\n\nPreface vii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 1\n\n2 Civic and Political Engagement 29\n\n3 Service Delivery 64\n\n4 Values and Faith 96\n\n5 Social Entrepreneurship 129\n\n6 Balancing the Functions of Nonprofit and\nVoluntary Action 163\n\nNotes 183\n\nIndex 209\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n1\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit\nand Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector is the contested arena between the\nstate and the market where public and private concerns meet and where\nindividual and social efforts are united. Nonprofit and voluntary action\nexpresses a complex and at times conflicting desire to defend the pursuit\nof private individual aspirations, while at the same time affirming the\nidea of a public sphere shaped by shared goals and values. For this\ndifficult balancing act to work, participation in the sector demands a\ncommitment to, among other things, expression, engagement, entrepre-\nneurship, and service. Constituted by both legally chartered nonprofit\norganizations and myriad informal groups and voluntary associations,\nthis sector occupies an increasingly critical and visible position in our\npolitical, social, and economic life.1 Yet despite its size and perceived\ninfluence, there is considerable uncertainty and confusion about its\nboundaries. The lines delimiting the sector have frequently been subject\nto challenge and revision, as funds and responsibilities have shifted back\nand forth among business, nonprofit, and government organizations.\nReaching consensus on the very definition of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector is difficult because many of the core features and activities of\nnonprofits increasingly overlap and compete with those of business and\ngovernment.\n\nThus, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is at once a visible and com-\npelling force in society and an elusive mass of contradictions. On the\none hand, the rise of nonprofits is thought to have contributed to de-\nmocratization around the world, opening up societies and giving people\na voice and a mode of collective expression that has in too many cases\n\n1\n\n\n\nbeen suppressed.2 In the United States, nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are seen as playing a central role in generating, organizing, and\nemboldening political opposition, working through national networks\nand building international linkages. Nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions have also acted as practical vehicles for the delivery of a broad\nspectrum of community services, ranging from affordable housing to\ntheater performances to vocational training to health care. The nonprofit\nsector appears, therefore, to be a real and identifiable group of tax-ex-\nempt organizations that encourage political engagement and produce\nservices. The sector is in fact a documented economic powerhouse that\nemploys millions of people and accounts for a significant portion of the\nnation\u2019s gross domestic product. All of which makes the nonprofit sector\na strong and compelling concept that appears grounded in economic,\npolitical, and legal reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the nonprofit and voluntary sector is home to\nsuch a wide range of organizations that grouping them together into one\nentity is highly problematic. From the largest hospitals and universi-\nties (which fund their operations by collecting fees or tuition) to small\nmentoring programs and avant-garde arts organizations (which survive\non charitable contributions), nonprofits span a tremendous range of or-\nganizational forms. Many of these forms are stable and lasting, while\nothers are fragile and transient. Some of the organizations that are con-\nsidered part of the nonprofit sector, such as religious congregations and\nprivate membership organizations, operate without government fund-\ning. Other nonprofit organizations, particularly those that service the el-\nderly and poor, could not survive without the steady flow of funds from\nfederal, state, and local government. Beyond differences in funding, the\norganizations within the sector are balkanized by legal status, level of\nprofessionalization, and underlying purpose.\n\nThus, any exploration of the nonprofit and voluntary sector would\ndo well to begin by acknowledging its fundamentally contested nature.\nThis chapter reviews the difficulties in defining the central characteris-\ntics of nonprofit and voluntary organizations, the conflicting nature of\nthe words we use to describe this part of our world, and the evolving\nplace the sector occupies in America\u2019s fragmented and polarized political\nsphere. Throughout, the tensions inherent in the very idea of organiza-\ntions operating between the state and the market emerge again and\nagain. All of which leads to the analytic framework that guides this book\n\n2 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nin its exploration of the overarching functions of the nonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector.\n\nThree Features of Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations\n\nAttempting to define the fundamental features of the disparate enti-\nties that constitute the nonprofit and voluntary sector is a complex and\ndaunting task. Yet there are at least three features that connect these\nwidely divergent entities: (1) they do not coerce participation; (2) they\noperate without distributing profits to stakeholders; and (3) they exist\nwithout simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Taken\ntogether, these three features might make nonprofit and voluntary orga-\nnizations appear weak, inefficient, and directionless, but nothing could\nbe further from the truth. In reality, these structural features give these\nentities a set of unique advantages that position them to perform impor-\ntant societal functions neither government nor the market is able to\nmatch.\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental of the three features is the sector\u2019s\nnoncoercive nature. Citizens cannot be compelled by nonprofit organi-\nzations to give their time or money in support of any collective goal.\nThis means that, in principle at least, nonprofits must draw on a large\nreservoir of good will. This noncoercive character is also what most\nstarkly differentiates the sector from government, which can levy taxes,\nimprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways. The\npower of coercion that the public sector possesses is a powerful tool for\nmoving collectivities toward common ends, but it is also a source of\nstrife and contention. Trust in government is now low,3 making the ef-\nfective use of state power more and more difficult as its legitimacy fades.\nFor nonprofit and voluntary organizations, these issues do not arise.\nFree choice is the coin of the realm: donors give because they choose to\ndo so. Volunteers work of their own volition. Staff actively seek employ-\nment in these organizations, often at lower wages than they might se-\ncure elsewhere. Clients make up their own minds that these organiza-\ntions have something valuable to offer. Though they stand ready to\nreceive, nonprofit and voluntary organizations demand nothing. As a\nconsequence, nonprofits occupy a moral high ground of sorts when\ncompared to public sector organizations that have the ability to compel\naction and coerce those who resist.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 3\n\n\n\nIn some ways, the noncoercive character of the nonprofit and volun-\ntary sector situates it closer to the market than to government. Business\ndepends on the free choice of consumers in a competitive market where\nalternatives are often plentiful and where no firm has the capacity to\ncompel anyone to purchase its goods or services. Similarly, nonprofit or-\nganizations cannot coerce participation or consumption of their ser-\nvices. The sector makes choices available, rather than deciding for oth-\ners. When it comes to the mobilization of funds, the parallel between\nbusiness and nonprofits is equally clear. Just as no one forces anyone to\nbuy shares or invest in enterprises, no one forces anyone to give or vol-\nunteer in the nonprofit world. The flow of resources to a nonprofit de-\npends entirely on the quality and relevance of its mission and its capac-\nity to deliver value. To the extent that a business firm or a nonprofit\norganization is performing well, investors and donors will be attracted\nto it. Should things take a turn for the worse, investment funds and phil-\nanthropic funds usually seek out other options quickly.\n\nThe second feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations sharply\ndifferentiates them from business firms, however. While corporations\nare able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations cannot make such distributions to outside parties. Rather,\nthey must use all residual funds for the advancement of the organiza-\ntion\u2019s mission.4 By retaining residuals rather than passing them on to in-\nvestors, nonprofit organizations seek to reassure clients and donors that\ntheir mission takes precedence over the financial remuneration of any\ninterested parties. The nondistribution constraint has been seen as a tool\nthat nonprofits can use to capitalize on failures in the market. Since\nthere are certain services, such as child care and health care, that some\nconsumers feel uncomfortable receiving if the provider is profit driven,\nnonprofits are able to step in and meet this demand by promising that no\ninvestors will benefit by cutting corners or by delivering unnecessary\nservices.\n\nWhile the noncoercive feature of nonprofits brings nonprofits closer\nto business and separates them from government, the nondistribution\nconstraint pushes nonprofits closer to the public sector and away from\nthe private sector. Government\u2019s inability to pay out profits from the sale\nof goods or services is related to its need to be perceived as impartial and\nequitable.5 With nonprofits, the nondistribution constraint also builds\nlegitimacy and public confidence, though this does not mean that spe-\n\n4 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncial powers are vested in these organizations. In both sectors, the non-\ndistribution constraint strongly reinforces the perception that these enti-\nties are acting for the good of the public.\n\nThe third feature of nonprofit and voluntary organizations is that they\nhave unclear lines of ownership and accountability.6 This trait sepa-\nrates these entities from both business and government. Businesses must\nmeet the expectations of shareholders or they risk financial ruin. The\nownership question in the business sector is clear and unambiguous:\nshareholders own larger or smaller amounts of equity in companies de-\npending on the number of shares held. Similarly, government is tethered\nto a well-identified group of individuals, namely voters. Executive and\nlegislative bodies\u2014and the public agencies they supervise at the federal,\nstate, and local levels\u2014must heed the will of the electorate if they are to\npursue public purposes effectively and retain the support and legitimacy\nneeded to govern. There is also a long tradition in the United States of\nconceiving government as \u201cbelonging\u201d to citizens, though the ways in\nwhich this ownership claim can be exercised are severely limited. In the\nnonprofit sector, clear lines of ownership and accountability are absent.7\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations must serve many masters,\nnone of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over these or-\nganizations. Donors, clients, board members, workers, and local com-\nmunities all have stakes, claims, or interests in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations. Yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the\nkey ownership group. The relative strength of these ownership claims\ndepends on how an organization is funded and on its chosen mission.8\n\nNonprofit organizations that depend heavily on charitable contributions\nare often held closely accountable by their donors, some of whom be-\nlieve that as social investors they have a real stake in the organizations\nto which they contribute. Nonprofits that are largely driven by service\nfees or commercial revenues are in a different position. While these\nmore commercial organizations do not have donors asserting claims\nover them, social entrepreneurs and professional staff may view them-\nselves as the key stakeholders in these more businesslike organizations.\n\nOften, however, the lines of ownership and accountability are ren-\ndered more complex by the fact that many nonprofit organizations com-\nbine funding from multiple sources\u2014foundations, corporations, and\ngovernment\u2014with earned income, making it hard to point to any par-\nticular party as the key stakeholder to whom these special institutions\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 5\n\n\n\nmust answer.9 One might be tempted to point out that nonprofit and\nvoluntary organizations are almost always governed by boards, and to\npropose this as a solution to the ownership and accountability issue. Un-\nfortunately, board members are not owners. They are stewards who are\nheld responsible for the actions of their organization. In the end, non-\nprofit and voluntary organizations are authorized to act in the public in-\nterest by the communities in which they operate, though the lines of ac-\ncountability are weaker than those in the public sector and the lines of\nownership far more obscure than in the business sector.\n\nThese three features of nonprofit organizations are not without con-\ntroversy and contention. In fact, each has been called into question in\nrecent years. First, the noncoercive nature of the sector has been chal-\nlenged by the growing tendency to mandate community service or vol-\nunteer work. In the case of welfare reform, many states have required aid\nrecipients to complete a community service requirement in order to con-\ntinue receiving their monthly support payments.10 A growing number of\nhigh schools now make volunteering with a local organization a condi-\ntion for graduation. In addition, there have long been parts of the non-\nprofit landscape where strong norms are enforced on those who have\ncommitted to membership. Within professional associations, licenses to\npractice medicine, law, and other callings are granted and denied by\nnonprofit entities.11 Within many religions, the behavior of adherents is\nseverely constrained by doctrine. In some neighborhoods, independent\ncommunity groups have been granted the power to plan and constrain\nfuture development by residents. The exercise of power may be subtle\nin some cases. For example, many private funders exercise consider-\nable influence over the recipients of their grants. This influence can take\nthe form of a gentle suggestion or a condition of support that pro-\ngrams be revamped.12 Although the constraints imposed in each case\nfollow a decision to participate and join, the power of some nonprofits\nover groups of individuals is considerable. In each and all such in-\nstances,13 the noncoercive character of these organizations is called into\nquestion.\n\nSecond, the nondistribution constraint of nonprofit organizations has\nlikewise been under assault from a number of different directions. In re-\ncent years, increased scrutiny of the high salary levels of many nonprofit\nexecutives has led some to ask whether the \u201cprofits\u201d\u2014or, more accu-\nrately, the increased program revenues\u2014are not in fact being routinely\ndistributed to staff in the form of generous compensation and benefit\n\n6 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npackages.14 In the area of capitalization, large nonprofit organizations\nhave been aggressive in raising funds through bond offerings, which\ndo not offer investors the ownership stake that stock offerings do, but\nwhich have the effect of opening up major capital flows into the non-\nprofit sector. The accumulation of capital in the form of large endow-\nments has also called into question the boundary between business and\nnonprofit organizations: endowment funds, by their nature, are not used\nto fulfill an organization\u2019s immediate needs. Instead, they are invested in\nstocks, real estate, and other speculative investments designed in the\nlong run to maximize financial return. This is a strategic move that some\nhave characterized as contrary to the public purposes of nonprofit orga-\nnizations.15 Making the boundary between nonprofits and business firms\neven more opaque, at least one study has argued that the nondistri-\nbution constraint does not significantly increase consumer confidence\nin the trustworthiness of nonprofits compared to business firms.16\n\nThird, the ownerless character of nonprofit and voluntary organiza-\ntions has come under fire as the legal claims of nonprofit stakeholders\nhave evolved. The courts have held that only members (in the case of a\nmembership organization), trustees or directors, and the attorney gen-\neral in the state where the nonprofit is located have legal standing to\ncontest the action of a charitable corporation. Over the years, however,\nthe power of trustees and directors has grown substantially, not to the\npoint where they can claim ownership of the assets of a nonprofit, but to\nthe point where boards now have tremendous leeway in the way they\noperate a charitable organization.17 While these claims have rarely come\nto equal those of ownership, the lines of accountability have been drawn\nmore sharply, particularly as questions about the transfer of assets have\ncome up when nonprofit organizations have attempted to convert to for-\nprofit status.18\n\nThe ultimate result of these debates and trends is that the defining fea-\ntures of nonprofit organizations are evolving and are the subject of con-\nsiderable debate. The notion that there is some simple and unambiguous\ntest that can be developed to decide what sector an organization belongs\nto is no longer reasonable. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nthe states have developed statutes and rules that define and regulate\nthese special institutions, a different and far more complex reality has\nemerged. The legal code is often of limited value in the effort to deter-\nmine which organizations are really nonprofit and voluntary in their\noperation.\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 7\n\n\n\nComposition of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nIn the United States today, there are more than one and a half million\nregistered nonprofit organizations, as well as several million informally\norganized community groups. The formally registered organizations fall\ninto two broad and porous categories: those that serve the public and\nthose that serve members. The public-serving organizations, classified\nunder section 501(c)3 of the IRS code, operate in almost every imagin-\nable field of human endeavor, and include, among countless others, so-\ncial service agencies helping children, the elderly, and the poor; inde-\npendent schools and private colleges; community clinics and hospitals;\nthink tanks; environmental organizations; cultural groups such as muse-\nums, theaters, and historical societies; and a range of international assis-\ntance organizations. They are the most visible and recognizable part of\nthis organizational universe. But substantial resources are concentrated\nin the member-serving or mutual benefit organizations, which include\ncredit unions, business leagues, service clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations,\nand trade associations. They tackle problems ranging from the most\ncomplex issues of business policy to the most prosaic challenges of\nsmall-town life. Also included in the sector (though not filing forms an-\nnually with the IRS) is a vast array of churches, synagogues, and\nmosques that form the foundation of the nation\u2019s religious life. While we\ntend to think of congregations as membership organizations, they are\ntreated differently by government and are not subject to the same forms\nof oversight as other member-serving nonprofits.\n\nWhile the largest and better-financed nonprofit organizations receive\nthe bulk of public attention, important work is done by the army of\nless visible associations, clubs, networks, and groups through which\ncommunities come together and act.19 There is considerable dispute as\nto whether the legally chartered nonprofit organizations share enough\ntraits with informal voluntary associations to justify including both\ngroups in one sector.20 However, leaving these grassroots associations\nout of the picture grants far too much deference to the tax treatment of\nnonprofits and ignores the fact that informal associations and formal\nnonprofits both eschew the distribution of profits, are noncoercive, and\nhave no owners.\n\nPublic awareness of the sector is rapidly increasing, though surpris-\ningly little is known about the underlying purposes and values that ani-\n\n8 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nmate nonprofit and voluntary action or the vehicles through which these\nvalues and purposes are channeled. In part, this is because these activi-\nties reflect a sometimes confusing agglomeration of strongly held private\nvalues, as well as a set of complex public purposes. The sector can thus\nbe conceived as a tent covering public-serving charities, member-serv-\ning organizations, and a range of informal organizations, including vol-\nuntary and grassroots associations (see Figure 1.1).\n\nThis diverse and at times contradictory group of entities comprises or-\nganizations and associations that are neither part of the state nor fully\nengaged in the market. The sector\u2019s solutions to community and public\nproblems at times represent a conscious disavowal of commercial mar-\nkets and a realization that some exchanges are simply better conducted\nunder terms of mutuality and trust than under the strict dictate of caveat\nemptor.21 Using charitable contributions, many nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations can deliver services to clients who are unable to pay. At\nother times, nonprofit and voluntary action represents an attempt to\nmove beyond government action to find solutions to public problems\nthat a majority of citizens are unable or unwilling to support. Nonprofits\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 9\n\n1.1 Elements of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nThe\nnonprofit\n\nand\nvoluntary\n\nsector\n\nMember-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\nVoluntary\nassociations\n\nPublic-\nserving\n\nnonprofits\n\n\n\ncan and do speak to community needs that lie outside the priorities of\nthe median voter. But the position of this group of organizations in rela-\ntion to the market and the state is far more complex and changeable\nthan these simple claims of differentiation might lead one to believe. In\nsome fields of activity within the sector, intense commercialism has\neroded the moral high ground of these organizations and transformed\nnonprofits into shadow businesses that compete actively for clients able\nto pay for the services they offer. In other fields, nonprofits have lost\ntheir autonomy from government and have come to serve as dutiful im-\nplementers of public sector programs and priorities. The lack of clarity\nin the identity of nonprofit and voluntary organizations in relation to\nbusiness and government becomes ever more evident as soon as one\nconsiders the range of names used to speak about these entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a Name?\n\nThe process of arriving at a single term to designate this sphere of activ-\nity has been long and conflicted. Although the term \u201cnonprofit and vol-\nuntary sector\u201d is common today, many other terms have been devised\nover the years. The long-standing confusion over terminology can be\ntraced to the diversity of activities that need to be covered by whatever\nterm is chosen.22 Programs are delivered through both formal and infor-\nmal organizations, carried out by both salaried and volunteer staff, and\nsupported through donations, contracts, and commercial revenues. As a\nconsequence, the formal organizations that constitute the sector have at\nvarious times and for various reasons been called \u201cthe tax-exempt sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe nongovernmental sector,\u201d \u201cthe independent sector,\u201d \u201cthe third\nsector,\u201d \u201cthe civil society sector,\u201d \u201cthe commons,\u201d \u201cthe charitable sec-\ntor,\u201d \u201cthe voluntary sector,\u201d \u201cthe nonproprietary sector,\u201d and \u201cthe non-\nprofit sector.\u201d The terminological debate continues today. Each of the\nmany terms that has emerged over time has had its own historical and\npolitical baggage. A brief review of these terms will illustrate the scope\nof the sector, even if a definitive defense of any particular term is impos-\nsible.\n\nOne of the earliest names attached to these organizations was in some\nways the narrowest and the most descriptively accurate: \u201ctax-exempt.\u201d\nAfter the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nand the establishment of the national income tax in 1913, Congress\n\n10 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ngranted tax-exempt status to those organizations that were specifically\n\u201corganized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, and edu-\ncational purposes.\u201d Later additions included a long series of very spe-\ncific purposes, including \u201cprevention of cruelty to children or animals\u201d\n(1918), \u201ccommunity chest, fund, or foundation\u201d (1921), and \u201ctesting\nfor public safety\u201d (1954). The categories of tax-exemption have shifted\nover time; today there are more than twenty different specific categories\nof tax-exempt organizations delineated under the Internal Revenue\nCode. The arbitrariness of these narrow categories can best be seen to-\nday in the fact that international sports organizations are specifically rec-\nognized, whereas health organizations are not. But this is of little conse-\nquence, since the vast majority of public-serving nonprofits file today\nunder the catch-all category 501(c)(3). For a time, the moniker \u201ctax-ex-\nempt organizations\u201d was widely used inside government and within the\nlegal community because it pointed\u2014or at least appeared to point\u2014to\nthe black letter of government regulation. Yet because this approach did\nnot capture the huge number of clubs, associations, and groups that\nhave never been formally registered with the IRS, it fell out of favor and\nwas replaced with others.\n\nIn the 1970s, efforts to find a broader and more inclusive term led to a\nwhole series of names that aimed at positioning the sector in opposi-\ntion to government. Today, the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d\n(NGO) remains popular around the world. It is used to denote the array\nof organizations that pursue public purposes through largely private\nmeans. It covers both indigenous organizations working within particu-\nlar countries overseas and international organizations that work around\nthe world. While not specifically limited to a particular field of activity,\nwhen the term \u201cnongovernmental organization\u201d is used today, it usually\ndenotes an organization that works to promote such things as rural de-\nvelopment, education, environmental quality, and community health.\nWhat is interesting about the term \u201cnongovernmental\u201d is that it defines\nthese independent organizations in opposition to government, rather\nthan in opposition to business firms. One possible explanation for the\npopularity of this term internationally is the power and dominance that\nthe state enjoys in many developing countries and the relative absence\nof organized opposition. The sector is thus defined as that which is not\npart of the state, rather than that which is not oriented toward profit-\nmaking. This choice also implicitly reflects the oppositional role of lo-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 11\n\n\n\ncal nongovernmental organizations, which do in fact challenge govern-\nments and hold them accountable. In some countries, small, informal\norganizations within the broader NGO sector are at times termed \u201cpeo-\nple\u2019s organizations\u201d and \u201ccommunity-based organizations,\u201d as a way of\ndifferentiating them from larger, more formal institutions. The label\n\u201cnongovernmental\u201d remains firmly entrenched in current usage, partic-\nularly when Americans seek to distinguish between American nonprofit\norganizations and international NGOs.\n\nThe term \u201cindependent sector\u201d came into popular usage in the 1980s\nand can be traced to a particular event\u2014namely, the founding of Inde-\npendent Sector, the national trade association representing both grant-\nmaking and grant-receiving organizations.23 Founded in 1979, the group\nconsolidated two existing associations and sought to unify the motley\nworld of foundations and nonprofit organizations. By advancing the use\nof the term \u201cindependent sector,\u201d organizers of the association wanted\nto emphasize the capacity of these organizations to devise solutions free\nfrom the market and political pressures. The only problem with this\nterm is that over time it became increasingly obvious that nonprofits\nwere neither independent from government nor free from the pressures\nof the marketplace. As government funding for social service and health\nnonprofits has risen sharply, many have come to view nonprofit organi-\nzations as engaged in important collaborative relationships with govern-\nment. Independence from government has come to be seen as more of a\nwish than a reality. Similarly, the idea that nonprofit organizations oper-\nate independently from the market has been called into question by the\ngrowing number of cross-sector partnerships, joint marketing agree-\nments, and nonprofit commercial ventures.\n\nAt times, the term \u201cthird sector\u201d has been in vogue. Popularized by\nseveral early researchers in the field of nonprofit and voluntary action,24\n\nthis term had the advantage of covering both formally constituted non-\nprofit organizations and the countless informal grassroots organizations\nthat populate the sector. The idea that nonprofit and voluntary action\nwas somehow third in line after government and business rubbed some\npeople the wrong way, however. It seemed to imply a kind of inferiority\nand subsidiarity that few in the sector were willing to concede. While\nthe term \u201cthird sector\u201d is still sometimes used in the research commu-\nnity, the practitioner community rarely uses it. Like \u201cnonprofit\u201d and\n\n12 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d the term \u201cthird sector\u201d seems to define these orga-\nnizations in isolation from the other sectors.\n\nThe term \u201ccivil society\u201d was coined by the classic writers of political\ntheory, and has regained currency of late. The modern idea of civil soci-\nety plays a prominent role in the work of Hobbes, Montesquieu, and\nHegel, who used it to refer to the broad private realm outside the state.\nOne of the problems with using the term today is that \u201ccivil society\u201d tra-\nditionally encompassed everything from the family to the church to the\nbusiness corporation. Still, the term is acquiring popularity both in the\nUnited States and internationally, and it has lately come to refer to some-\nthing more concrete than the huge and abstract private realm outside\nthe state. In practice, it has come to denote a set of voluntary mediating\ninstitutions that invite individuals to come together to pursue shared in-\nterests, values, and commitments. Over the past decade, \u201ccivil society\norganizations\u201d has come to compete with \u201cnongovernmental organiza-\ntions\u201d among people interested in indigenous social movements around\nthe world, ranging from small local organizations to large international\ninstitutions.\n\nMore recently, yet another solution to the name game was proposed.\nInstead of a term that either defined the essential characteristic of these\norganizations or that situated these organizations in relation to gov-\nernment and the market, a new form of reference was proposed: \u201cthe\ncommons.\u201d Advocates for the term argued that the vast landscape of\nnonprofit and voluntary action constitutes a special terrain of shared\nconcerns.25 \u201cThe commons\u201d was intended to solve some of the prob-\nlems associated with previous attempts at naming the sector. It denoted\nthe vast array of relationships between benefactors, intermediaries, and\nbeneficiaries that constitutes a space in which associative communities\ncan operate freely. Linked to the Greek term koinonia, \u201cthe commons\u201d\nemphasizes free participation, common purpose, shared goods, a sense\nof mutuality, and a commitment to fairness.26 A critical part of what\ndistinguishes \u201cthe commons\u201d from other attempts to delineate the non-\nmarket and nonstate realm of activity is that the definition focuses not\njust on what kinds of purposes are accomplished, but also on the ways\nin which they are accomplished. By pointing to the features of koinonia,\n\u201cthe commons\u201d defines the boundary of the sector in ethical terms.\n\nIn several European countries today, the dominant term is \u201cthe chari-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 13\n\n\n\ntable sector,\u201d which captures the critical philanthropic character of these\norganizations and their activities. The very use of the term \u201ccharity,\u201d\nhowever, harks back to Victorian England, the settlement house move-\nment, and the class elitism associated with \u201cpoor aid\u201d and \u201calms giving.\u201d\nBecause self-help and community empowerment have become rallying\npoints for the sector, the idea of calling this part of society \u201ccharitable\u201d\noffends some people because it puts the spotlight on the contributions\nof elite patrons and donors, not on the efforts of activists, caregivers, and\nclients. The term also implies that much of the work of the sector is\nfunded through private gifts, when in reality government funding and\nearned income now fuel large parts of the sector.\n\n\u201cThe voluntary sector\u201d has been in use intermittently for decades,\nboth in the United States and abroad. One clear advantage of the term is\nthat it focuses on the vast landscape of formal and informal organiza-\ntions that work for the public good. It is a way of including the millions\nof neighborhood-based groups that operate without legal recognition.\nYet the name has been criticized at times for obscuring the growing pro-\nfessionalism of nonprofit activity, a subject of considerable sensitivity. As\npart of the process of receiving more and more funding from public sec-\ntor agencies through contractual relationships, many nonprofit manag-\ners now take great pride in the fact that they have removed all vestiges of\namateurism associated with volunteerism and have replaced it with the\nprofessional work of highly trained people.\n\nMost recently, some people dissatisfied with the existing alternatives\nhave begun using the term \u201cnonproprietary organizations\u201d in order to\nhighlight the ownerless character of these entities. In contrast to busi-\nness firms that are proprietary, nonproprietary organizations are not\nlinked to a clear owner or ownership group. This alternative has been\nadvanced because the term \u201cnonprofit\u201d obscures the fact that many\n\u201cnonproprietaries\u201d do in fact generate surplus revenue, though they do\nnot directly distribute their earnings to shareholders or owners. While\nthis term has the benefit of drawing a clear line between business firms\nand nonprofits, it does not resolve the question of what differentiates\nnonprofits from government agencies, which are also nonproprietary.\n\nOf the many competing options, the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has been\nthe most widely used over time. Rather than defining these organiza-\ntions in terms of the special privilege they enjoy of being free from taxa-\ntion, the term points in a different and less contentious direction by em-\n\n14 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nphasizing the benevolent character of the sector. Though there is some\nquestion as to when exactly the term \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d came into use,\nthe consensus is that it is a product of the 1950s and 1960s. The term\n\u201cnonprofit\u201d focuses on one of the three defining features mentioned\nabove\u2014namely, that these organizations are not intended to generate\nprofits and distribute them to investors. Since this term distinguishes\nnonprofit organizations from business corporations, some observers\nhave argued that it was actually designed to confer a kind of legitimacy\nand trustworthiness.27 In recent years, the substantial increase in com-\nmercial revenues and executive salaries within the nonprofit sector has\nled many to question just how unprofitable the sector truly is. Still, the\nlabel \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d has the benefit of currency and simplicity.\n\nBecause the sector comprises both legally chartered nonprofit organi-\nzations and countless informal groups and voluntary associations, I will\nuse the somewhat cumbersome though descriptively accurate \u201cnon-\nprofit and voluntary sector\u201d to denote the organizations occupying an\nincreasingly critical and visible position in our political, social, and eco-\nnomic life. Though not perfect, the term points accurately to the target\npopulation of organizations that are emerging as critical actors even\nthough they operate without coercion, profits, or owners. This is a com-\npromise solution that many researchers working in this field use, though\nsome fall back on \u201cnonprofit sector\u201d for brevity\u2019s sake. Though it does\nnot please everyone, the term does meet the requirement of being broad\nenough to cover the range of organizations and groups that are acting\nprivately for some collective good.\n\nUnderlying all the names that have been used to describe these enti-\nties is the fact that even when agreement is reached on a single appro-\npriate name, it is not entirely clear that this complex and varied set of or-\nganizations constitutes a single coherent societal \u201csector.\u201d28 In many\nways, the word \u201csector\u201d is just as problematic as \u201cindependent,\u201d \u201cthird,\u201d\n\u201cnongovernmental,\u201d and all the terms that have preceded it. An impor-\ntant part of the problem is the lack of consistency across the organiza-\ntions that are said to be part of this sector. After all, the sector includes\norganizations that cater to the narrow needs and desires of their mem-\nberships, as well as organizations that have broad public service mis-\nsions.29 The sector is also home to highly institutionalized organizations\nwith millions of dollars in revenues and informally organized groups\nwith little or no money. The sector includes political parties that exist to\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 15\n\n\n\nshape public policy and service delivery organizations that depend on\nthe political process to deliver needed funds. The sector counts as its\nconstituents both foundations that give away money30 and a multitude\nof organizations that seek grants, as well as a growing number of organi-\nzations that depend on fees and commercial revenues. Thus, given the\ngreat diversity of formal and informal structures, the varieties of pur-\nposes pursued, and the range of financing systems used to support these\norganizations, the very use of the word \u201csector\u201d is troublesome because\nit implies far more consistency than may be present. Some scholars of\nnonprofits thus maintain that the idea of a coherent sector may be an in-\nvention, which has begun to outlive its usefulness and now merely pro-\nvides cover for a large and diverse group of organizations that have little\nin common.31\n\nYet, by defining a set of activities that are neither part of government\nnor part of the market,32 we acknowledge that there is a sphere where\ncoercion is not used, where profits are not the principal motive, and\nwhere lines of ownership are not clearly drawn. Why nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations exist and what functions they perform are among\nthe central topics of this book. Before presenting a framework for think-\ning about these issues, it is important to recognize some of the political\ncleavages that the very idea of a nonprofit and voluntary sector creates.\n\nThe Politics of the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\nThe nonprofit and voluntary sector occupies an ambiguous and at times\ncontentious position in the current American political scene. Just as few\npeople agree on the right name to use to describe these organizations,\nAmericans are likewise engaged in heated debate about the sector\u2019s un-\nderlying politics. Today, for quite different reasons, nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations are embraced by both conservatives and liberals. How\ncan this be? The answer lies in the fact that the sector comprises a great\nnumber of complex, multidimensional organizations that appeal simul-\ntaneously to many constituencies. The fact that both sides of the politi-\ncal spectrum applaud and see the potential of nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations, far from revealing some underlying weakness, ultimately\nreflects the sector\u2019s strength and enduring relevance.\n\nFor at least three reasons, nonprofit and voluntary organizations have,\nparticularly from the 1960s forward, represented a tremendous resource\n\n16 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nand ally to liberals. First, a natural affinity between liberals and non-\nprofit workers quickly became apparent, since those willing to toil in\noften low-paying or voluntary positions\u2014and frequently in difficult cir-\ncumstances\u2014constitute a self-selected group of socially committed in-\ndividuals dedicated to the idea of making a difference and initiating\nchange. As membership in labor unions declined, thus eroding one of\nthe traditional bases of the Democratic party, the rise of nonprofit social\nservice agencies in the 1970s came at a very opportune moment. Not\nonly could nonprofit organizations serve as new channels through\nwhich social programs could be delivered, but they also represented a\nnew and important space in which potential supporters of progressive\npolicies might well be located.33\n\nThe second reason liberals were attracted to the sector as a whole was\nmore operational. Nonprofit organizations were seen as an ideal and un-\ntainted partner to government, one that could most effectively deliver\nneeded services to the most disadvantaged populations. As concern over\nthe impact of Great Society programs grew and as distrust of govern-\nment increased, nonprofits came to be seen as neutral and legitimizing\nforces with the capacity to give large human service initiatives a more di-\nverse, pluralistic face.34 The funding crunch that most nonprofit organi-\nzations face on a continuing basis appeared to put government in a posi-\ntion to use its substantial resources, in the form of contracts and grants,\nto gain control over a whole new range of community actors and prob-\nlems. At the same time, nonprofits represented an ideal \u201cbottom-up\u201d ap-\nproach to implementation, one that empowered the grassroots level and\nthat gave government tremendous leverage for each dollar spent.\n\nThird and finally, liberals were attracted by the political activity of\nmany nonprofits and their ability to mobilize groups around issues and\nconcerns in a distinctive way. Unlike corporations, which are beholden\nto shareholders and the bottom line, and unlike government, which is\nbound by the limits of the Constitution and the pressures of public opin-\nion, nonprofit organizations have a great deal more freedom to oper-\nate. This flexibility lends itself well, in principle, to the pursuit of pro-\ngressive, alternative agendas. Moreover, since many advocacy nonprofits\nseek to give voice to populations that have long been excluded from the\npolitical debate, liberals continue to view the broader nonprofit sector as\na means to exert pressure for social change and justice.35\n\nChanges in the national political climate since the 1980s coincided\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 17\n\n\n\nwith a very different set of ideas about the nonprofit sector. Instead of\nconsidering nonprofits a potential source of political and social change,\nconservatives were attracted by three completely different features of\nnonprofits. First, they believed that nonprofit organizations might well\nrepresent an appealing alternative to direct public expenditures on so-\ncial programs that conservatives believed had not produced results.36\n\nQuestions about whether the War on Poverty had failed were in the air,\nespecially in the early 1980s. By encouraging private charities to take\nresponsibility for local community needs, conservatives believed they\ncould make an effective argument for shrinking government. After all, if\nchurches and community groups were able to function with voluntary\ncontributions of time and money, the need for an ever-growing number\nof public spending programs would surely be diminished. Compared to\ntaxation and national spending, private charity and volunteerism were\nseen as preferred means of solving social problems because they permit-\nted greater individual freedom and choice. A strong and vital nonprofit\nand voluntary sector fit well with the emerging ideas of both devolution\nand privatization, two mantras of the conservative movement. As gov-\nernment functions were pushed \u201cdown\u201d from the federal level to the\nstate and local levels, and transferred \u201cout\u201d of government to private\nproviders through contracting, nonprofits were ideally situated to de-\nliver services that once had been the province of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d in the na-\ntion\u2019s capital.37\n\nSecond, conservatives also argued that nonprofits, particularly faith-\nbased nonprofits, were in a position to bring to social programs some-\nthing that public entitlements had long lacked\u2014namely, a moral or spir-\nitual component.38 Faith-based nonprofits were seen as willing to make\ndemands on the recipients of charity and require a change of character\nand behavior in exchange for assistance. At the same time, given that\nmany nonprofits are fueled by volunteer labor and private contributions,\nconservatives were attracted to the idea of nonprofits because they rep-\nresented the ideal of self-help and independence. This was a powerful\nfeature that, conservatives argued, was perilously missing from public\nassistance programs.39 For those who believed that public entitlements\nbred dependence and complacency, the idea of delivering not just a\ncheck but a moral and spiritual message was a very strong attraction.\n\nFinally, for conservatives, nonprofit organizations were also a poten-\ntial wellspring of innovation, representing a plurality of local solutions\n\n18 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nto social problems and a powerful alternative to the ongoing search for\nuniform national solutions to public problems. Grounded in an ethos of\nself-help and respecting regional cultural variations, voluntary action fit\nwell with a growing sense among conservatives that a broad range of al-\nternatives to an expanding state needed to be actively cultivated. By giv-\ning local organizations a chance to try their hand at program implemen-\ntation, conservatives believed that good ideas would percolate up from\ncommunities. Conservatives argued that expenditures on federal social\nwelfare and education programs should not be increased. Instead, funds\ncould be used most effectively and creatively when channeled through\nlocal groups that were more in touch with the diverse and changing\nneeds of the people. Nonprofit organizations thus represented a way of\nbreaking through the red tape of Washington to find new approaches\nto longstanding problems. Nonprofits, conservatives maintained, could\nserve as a battering ram for policy innovation.40\n\nAt first blush, it might appear that the capacity of nonprofit and vol-\nuntary organizations to speak to both liberals and conservatives implies\neither a split and conflicted identity or a simple lack of political scruples.\nIn reality, the sector is a remarkably complex entity, one that is capa-\nble\u2014like an inkblot\u2014of evoking a broad range of reactions and in-\nterpretations. Because it simultaneously supports the autonomy of the\nprivate individual actor while affirming the importance of shared and\npublic purposes, the politics of nonprofit and voluntary action can take\non many different meanings. The ability to speak across, or rather above,\ntraditional political boundaries has become one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the sector, and this trait has led to its growth and popularity,\nparticularly among young people.\n\nThe Two Dimensions of Nonprofit and Voluntary Action\n\nGiven the confusion over what to call this sector and the complex and at\ntimes confused politics that have surrounded it, the goal of this small\nbook is to help shape our understanding of the many different ways one\ncan approach the core functions of these independent organizations. To\nmake this task easier, I organize my exposition of the central functions\nof voluntary and nonprofit organizations along two broad conceptual\ndistinctions. The first critical distinction concerns how the sector is\nexplained; the question is whether nonprofit and voluntary activity is\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 19\n\n\n\ndriven primarily by demand or by supply\u2014that is, whether it can best be\nunderstood as a response to unmet demands or whether it is taken to be\nan important supply function that creates its own demand. The second\ndistinction concerns how the sector is justified; here the issue is whether\nthe value of nonprofit and voluntary action is seen as residing in the in-\nstrumental character of the outcomes that are generated for society or in\nthe inherently expressive quality of the activities themselves that reward\nthose who undertake them. These are complex and difficult distinctions,\nwhich will be discussed in turn and then brought together to form the\nconceptual framework for the analysis that constitutes the core of the\nbook.\n\nStarting with the distinction between demand and supply, it is easy\nto see nonprofit and voluntary action as responding to two quite differ-\nent but important forces.41 The demand-side perspective starts with the\npremise that the sector exists by virtue of the broader social context\nwithin which it is embedded and that its activities are responsive to the\ndemands of the public or its members. Thus, nonprofits exist because\nthey are able to meet important social needs. Urgent public problems\nsuch as illiteracy, drug addiction, and violence demand solutions, and\nthe nonprofit sector exists to respond to the powerful pull of such is-\nsues. The demand-side approach to nonprofit activity has both descrip-\ntive and normative dimensions. Descriptive demand-side theories focus\non patterns of nonprofit formation and growth. In the 1970s, researchers\nproposed detailed economic models and explanations for nonprofits\u2019 be-\nhavior,42 most of which started with the assumption that nonprofits\nfulfill important demands that for one reason or another the market and\ngovernment are unable or unwilling to meet. This led to the broad and\npopular belief that nonprofits were really gap-filling entities that histori-\ncally have arisen when public needs were sufficiently strong.\n\nOn a more normative level, the demand-side approach to nonprofit\norganizations has spawned a literature focusing on the social and politi-\ncal responsibilities of nonprofit organizations\u2014defined in relation to the\ndemands of the neediest members of society. Starting with the claim that\nthe tax exemption accorded these institutions conveys an obligation to\nhelp, many people have made the normative argument that nonprofit or-\nganizations should seek to assist the most disadvantaged and empower\nthe most disenfranchised members of society. Accordingly, the success\nor failure of the sector can and should be judged by how well or how\n\n20 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\npoorly it meets society\u2019s needs. The demand for nonprofit and voluntary\naction leads neatly to a set of prescribed activities, including greater ad-\nvocacy work within the sector, and the empowerment and mobilization\nof those left out of the political process. The demand for nonprofit activ-\nity thus brings with it the expectation that these institutions will help\ngive voice and opportunity to those who have been marginalized by the\nmarket economy and the political process.\n\nThe idea of a demand-driven nonprofit and voluntary sector domi-\nnates much of the research that is conducted in this field. Yet a central\nclaim of this book is that the demand-side approach captures but one as-\npect of this broad social phenomenon. An alternative, supply-side posi-\ntion argues that the sector is impelled by the resources and ideas that\nflow into it\u2014resources and ideas that come from social entrepreneurs,\ndonors, and volunteers.43 This is a more controversial perspective be-\ncause it has led to some strong claims about how nonprofit organiza-\ntions should be managed and operated. Rejecting many of the preceding\narguments about the needs that pull on the sector, the supply-side per-\nspective holds that nonprofit and voluntary organizations are really all\nabout the people with resources and commitment who fire the engine of\nnonprofit and voluntary action. Drawn to the sector by visions and com-\nmitments, social entrepreneurs bring forward agendas that often operate\nindependently of immediately obvious and enduring community needs.\nThis supply-side theory of nonprofits, like the demand-side approach,\nhas both descriptive and normative elements.\n\nOn the descriptive side, this approach emphasizes the entrepreneur-\nial quality of nonprofit activity. Instead of starting with the demand of\nclients, positive supply-side theories of the nonprofit sector draw at-\ntention to the way various forms of entrepreneurship fuel innovation\nwithin the sector and how an emerging class of new social enterprises\u2014\nincreasingly led by a new generation of social entrepreneurs\u2014is chal-\nlenging old models of nonprofit management. Seen from the supply\nside, nonprofit organizations have a logic that is far more complex than\na simple response to a gap in government service or the failure of the\nmarket to meet a particular demand. The entrepreneur, donor, and vol-\nunteer take on a much greater role in this model, since it is the sup-\nply of new ideas, charitable dollars, and volunteer commitments that is\nthe real driving force behind the sector. This means that the task of\nexplaining the emergence of nonprofit and voluntary organizations\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 21\n\n\n\nrequires studying and developing typologies of social entrepreneurs\nwho use the nonprofit form to pursue their private visions of the public\ngood.\n\nThe supply-side approach has an important normative component,\nwhich holds that we must reassess the moral claims that needy clients\nhave on nonprofit programs. Instead of asking that a nonprofit meet a\ntest of moral stewardship that is ultimately decided by the level and\nquality of service provided to those in need, the supply-side approach\nadvises that society should look to and protect the private interests and\nvalues of the critical actors who are fueling nonprofit and voluntary ac-\ntion, including philanthropic donors, volunteers, and social entrepre-\nneurs. In order to ensure the continued flow of charitable inputs, the in-\nterests and values of these actors should be the first priority of those who\nseek an enlarged role for nonprofits. This means recognizing that the\nsatisfaction of donors and the preservation of their intent constitute a\ncritical normative task for the sector. Arguing that donors, volunteers,\nand social entrepreneurs should be the centerpiece of the sector is a con-\ntroversial position because it unabashedly diminishes the claims that\nneedy populations have on the charitable resources. Supply-siders coun-\nter this complaint with the argument that if one is truly committed to\nhelping the needy, then constructing a sector that recognizes, protects,\nand encourages action by the private parties who control the resources\nshould be an obvious priority.\n\nDistinguishing between the demand and supply sides of the nonprofit\nand voluntary sector is a primary task when it comes to sorting through\nthe arguments that have emerged in recent years. Yet we must also de-\nvelop a second dimension for our conceptual framework. As soon as we\nbegin to consider the broad number of important projects and causes to\nwhich the sector is dedicated, it becomes clear that nonprofit and volun-\ntary organizations rest on two different ideas about what justifies and\ngives meaning to the work that is carried out in the sector.\n\nFirst, nonprofit and voluntary action is an important instrument for\nthe accomplishment of tasks that communities view as important. Non-\nprofit service agencies and volunteer helping organizations play an im-\nportant role in the delivery of critical services in a broad array of fields.\nNonprofits can be the principal means through which job training, arts\neducation, shelter for the homeless, health care, neighborhood clean-\nups, firefighting, crime patrols, and countless other functions are ac-\n\n22 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncomplished. When the sector works to accomplish popular social pur-\nposes, it acquires powerful instrumental value. It becomes a concrete\ntool to achieve some collective purpose that society considers impor-\ntant. The sector\u2019s instrumental value is measured in terms of its concrete\noutcomes. In the search for validation and learning, the programmatic\noutcomes of nonprofit and voluntary action are increasingly being mea-\nsured and evaluated using metrics borrowed from the business and pub-\nlic sectors. The growing emphasis on performance has led to a vast new\nliterature on nonprofit management, which is aimed at making these\norganizations more efficient and useful instruments for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes.44 The idea that nonprofit and voluntary organi-\nzations are valuable because they can be useful tools for the accomplish-\nment of public purposes constitutes the core of what I will term the\n\u201cinstrumental dimension\u201d of the nonprofit and voluntary sector.\n\nSecond, the sector can be seen as valuable because it allows individu-\nals to express their values and commitment through work, volunteer ac-\ntivities, and donations. By committing to broad causes that are close to\nthe heart or by giving to an effort that speaks directly to the needs of the\ncommunity, nonprofit and voluntary action answers a powerful expres-\nsive urge. For donors, volunteers, and particularly staff, the very act of\nattempting to address a need or fight for a cause can be a satisfying end\nin itself, regardless of the ultimate outcome. The value that is created\nmay be entirely psychic and may arise simply from the act of expressing\ncommitment, caring, and belief. The expressive quality of the sector has\nled some to conclude that the narrow focus on the financial resources\navailable to nonprofit organizations and on the level of services deliv-\nered has detracted from the deeper meaning of nonprofit and voluntary\naction, which derives from the fellowship and self-actualization experi-\nenced by those who give or volunteer. This is what I will refer to as the\n\u201cexpressive dimension\u201d of nonprofit and voluntary action.45\n\nThe expressive and instrumental dimensions of nonprofit and volun-\ntary action can compliment each other or they can create tensions. In\nthe best cases, the moral energy that motivates those who deliver ser-\nvices can be harnessed to produce better and more effective programs. In\nsome ways, this connection seems obvious: a committed volunteer or\nsocial entrepreneur is more likely to work hard to create value through\nhis activities than someone who holds a job merely to earn a paycheck.\nIn some cases, however, values and personal expression can be out of\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 23\n\n\n\nsync with instrumental goals and may lead to trouble. On the one hand,\nif strong expressive desires draw people to causes and community prob-\nlems without adequate structure or planning, frustration can easily set\nin and group cohesion may be threatened. On the other hand, if too\nmuch focus is placed on improving a charitable organization\u2019s bottom\nline and maximizing the instrumental efficiency of its operations, an or-\nganization runs the risk of dimming the expressive flame of its staff, vol-\nunteers, and supporters. The managerial challenge, of course, is to bring\nthe expressive and instrumental dimensions into alignment.\n\nThe contrast between the supply and demand sides and the opposi-\ntion of the expressive and instrumental dimensions give us a basis for\nthinking systematically about the functions of nonprofit and voluntary\naction. We can construct a matrix that depicts, on one side, the nature of\nthe value produced by the sector (instrumental versus expressive) and,\non the other side, the underlying animus or force (demand versus sup-\nply). This book is organized around the four cells generated by this ma-\ntrix (see Figure 1.2), which have come to represent the four underlying\nfunctions of the nonprofit and voluntary sector: encouraging civic and\npolitical engagement, delivering needed services, enacting private values\nand religious convictions, and providing a channel for social entrepre-\nneurship.\n\nThe book works through and elaborates current debates relating to\neach of these four functions. Chapter 2 considers the role nonprofit or-\nganizations play in fostering civic and political engagement. Local non-\nprofits contribute in important ways to community cohesiveness, social\nsolidarity, and what some call \u201csocial capital,\u201d which is constituted by\nthe norms, networks, and forms of trust that make communities work.\nThese ties prepare people to play an active role in civic life and democ-\nracy. Grassroots community organizations also have the capacity to har-\nness this community spirit and generate social and political change.46\n\nUsing the protection afforded by the First Amendment, these advocacy\nand organizing efforts are a critical ingredient in our national political\nlife. In fields ranging from environmental protection to world peace,\nnonprofit and voluntary organizations have begun to exercise consider-\nable political power. Nonprofits play a powerful role in setting the terms\nof many public debates, in mobilizing key constituencies, and in coordi-\nnating grassroots campaigns to effect change at the local, state, national,\nand transnational levels.\n\n24 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nChapter 3 considers how nonprofits represent an effective and power-\nful tool for responding to concrete public needs that the market and the\nstate fail to meet. On the questions of why nonprofit organizations come\ninto being and what role they play in society, a strong line of argument\nhas emerged. Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, theo-\nries about nonprofits focused heavily on the idea of government and\nmarket failure. Researchers proposed the idea that nonprofit provision\nof particular services arises when either government is unable to meet\ndemand or when consumers are resistant to purchasing a given service\nin the for-profit marketplace. This positive theory of nonprofits em-\nbraced the subtle assumption that nonprofits were really just govern-\nment\u2019s partners, charged with helping to deliver needed services. Since\ngovernment and nonprofit organizations were thought to have the same\nbasic goals and values, collaboration between sectors was seen as largely\nunproblematic. Some of the progenitors of this early, foundational per-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 25\n\n1.2 The four functions of nonprofit and voluntary action.\n\nExpressive\nrationale\n\nInstrumental\nrationale\n\nDemand-side\norientation\n\nSupply-side\norientation\n\nService delivery\n\nProvides needed services and\nresponds to government and\nmarket failure\n\nSocial entrepreneurship\n\nProvides a vehicle for\nentrepreneurship and creates\nsocial enterprises that\ncombine commercial and\ncharitable goals\n\nValues and faithCivic and political engagement\n\nMobilizes citizens for politics,\nadvocates for causes, and\nbuilds social capital within\ncommunities\n\nAllows volunteers, staff, and\ndonors to express values,\ncommitments, and faith\nthrough work\n\n\n\nspective argue that the future of the nonprofit sector lies in its capacity\nto cooperate and collaborate effectively with government, even though\ntensions between sectors appear to be rising. Chapter 3 presents the\nearly models of nonprofit production, while raising new practical ques-\ntions about the interaction of nonprofits with government and the\nmarket.\n\nChapter 4 considers the essentially private character of nonprofit and\nvoluntary action that makes the sector an ideal vehicle for the expres-\nsion of personal values and spiritual beliefs. Nonprofit and voluntary or-\nganizations are places where believers of all sorts are welcome, some of\nwhom are motivated by faith, others by commitment to issues, and still\nothers by strongly held private values and norms. The value component\nof nonprofit work\u2014which goes beyond the rational, purposive function\nof that work\u2014is part of what defines the sector and attracts donors, vol-\nunteers, and entrepreneurs to nonprofit and voluntary action. The val-\nues that animate nonprofit and voluntary action can often be important\nsources for innovation and experimentation, as private visions of the\ncommon good are tested and refined. The discussion covers the contro-\nversial normative position that has evolved in recent years from this pos-\nitive analysis, which holds that the special visions of donors and entre-\npreneurs\u2014not the growing demands of the recipient organizations and\ntheir clients\u2014should define and shape nonprofit activity. It is important\nto note that when one shifts the focus of the normative analysis from re-\ncipients to donors, volunteers, and social entrepreneurs, the evaluative\ncriteria for the sector change radically. Instead of measuring outputs and\noutcomes for clients, evaluation looks at the subjective experience of\nthose funding and delivering the services. Because it flies in the face of\nthe more progressive ideas that have dominated thinking about the sec-\ntor, this particular part of the supply-side vision represents a way of see-\ning nonprofit and voluntary activity that challenges some of our com-\nfortable assumptions about nonprofit organizations.\n\nChapter 5 tracks one of most important changes in the sector over the\npast two decades\u2014namely, the growth of a new kind of social entrepre-\nneurship and the rise of commercial activities as a way of financing ag-\ngressive growth agendas. Rather than waiting for donors to support ini-\ntiatives with charitable dollars, more and more nonprofit managers are\nexposing their organizations to market forces. The rise of entrepreneur-\nship in nonprofit organizations is manifest in many different ways, in-\n\n26 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\ncluding the creation of new kinds of hybrid organizations, the influx of a\ngeneration of younger, more business-oriented managers, and a willing-\nness to rethink the traditional boundaries between for-profit and not-\nfor-profit enterprises. Many of the new entrepreneurial nonprofits ex-\nplicitly start out with the intention of producing social innovations that\nwill in turn create their own demand. This marks a major change from\nthe traditional idea of delivering services for which there is already a de-\nmand. To finance this start-up strategy, some social entrepreneurs have\ndeveloped funding plans that rely heavily on revenues from commercial\nventures of all kinds, not just charitable contributions or government\ngrants. Chapter 5 looks at both the theory and practice of nonprofit en-\ntrepreneurship.\n\nAfter reviewing the four core functions of the sector, Chapter 6 ex-\nplores emerging challenges connected to the sector\u2019s rapid growth and\nidentifies a few significant consequences that flow from seeing the sector\nas a diverse and pluralistic realm. The chapter, and the book as a whole,\nadvances a message connected to both the management of individual\nnonprofit organizations and the direction of the sector as a whole: each\nof the four functions of nonprofit activity is important in itself. But when\npursued in isolation and in excess, any of the functions can lead to im-\nbalance, at both the organizational level and the sectoral level. If individ-\nual nonprofits and the sector as a whole are seen as only engaging in po-\nlitical organizing and advocacy, charges of excessive politicization are\nlikely to arise sooner or later. If the sole focus of nonprofit activity is the\nefficient delivery of publicly funded services, concerns about indepen-\ndence and vendorism will never be far away. If nonprofits do nothing but\nenact private values and interests, worries about particularism will al-\nmost certainly arise. If nonprofit activity comes to be focused too much\non the creation of income-generating ventures, objections related to\ncommercialism will be difficult to counter. Balance and a plurality of\npurposes thus turn out to be critical to sustaining nonprofit organiza-\ntions and to the sector\u2019s continued growth and success.\n\nAt a time when nonprofit and voluntary activity has been the subject\nof increasing public attention and academic study, the breadth and depth\nof our understanding of this phenomenon has been severely constrained\nby the lack of a clear statement of the sector\u2019s core activities, rationales,\nand dimensions. This book strives to respond to this need by presenting\nfour critical functions that the sector performs. While it does not pre-\n\nThe Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector 27\n\n\n\ntend that these functions entirely exhaust the range of purposes and ra-\ntionales that guide nonprofit and voluntary action, the book argues that\nmany of the most essential conceptual and policy problems within the\nsector can be usefully captured with this framework. The normative ar-\ngument of the book is simply that the sector cannot survive and gar-\nner financial, political, and volunteer support if it swings too far in the\ndirection of any particular function. In the long run, balance, achieved\nthrough the fulfillment of a diversity of functions, is ultimately essential\nwithin the vast range of nonprofit organizations and across the sector as\na whole.\n\nNonprofit and voluntary action can be a powerful force for good in so-\nciety. Yet a good many myths have grown up around these private orga-\nnizations that fulfill public purposes. In searching for the core functions\nof the nonprofit and voluntary sector, the book challenges some of these\nmyths and suggests that the nonprofit and voluntary sector is an evolv-\ning and at times contradictory realm that now faces a number of sig-\nnificant challenges to its continued growth and legitimacy. Rather than\nattempting to smooth over and resolve these tensions, the exposition\nhere deliberately brings them out in to the open. Ultimately, it is the di-\nversity of purposes and rationales embodied in nonprofit and voluntary\norganizations that make them increasingly visible and exciting vehicles\nfor the pursuit of common social goals. And it is the sector\u2019s diversity\nand flexibility that may well help nonprofit organizations to solve some\nof the pressing challenges they now confront.\n\n28 The Idea of a Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector\n\n\n\nCivic and Political Engagement Civic and Political Engagement\n\n2\n\nCivic and Political Engagement\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations respond to the deeply rooted\nneed of individuals to be part of something bigger than themselves. As\nan antidote to atomistic individualism, nonprofit and voluntary activity\nat the local, state, national, and transnational levels brings people out of\ntheir isolation and puts them in touch with others who share their con-\ncerns and interests. The connections forged when people are drawn into\ncivic space can be used to respond to community concerns, needs, and\ndemands. By virtue of their emphasis on expressive, associational activ-\nity, nonprofits allow individuals and communities to transform their\ncommitment into concrete collective action. When nonprofits speak di-\nrectly to important public needs and lead collectivities to devise effective\nsolutions to public problems, these diverse organizations\u2014ranging from\nblock clubs to national membership groups\u2014help overcome some of\nthe cynicism and distrust that stifle civic and political engagement. The\nspecial ability of nonprofit and voluntary activity to mobilize and con-\nnect individuals clearly has significant direct and indirect political impli-\ncations.1\n\nNonprofit and voluntary organizations are linked with the political\nprocess in six different ways, which range in character from nonpartisan\nto very partisan. First, nonprofits build trust, cohesion and social capital\nin communities. Through church groups, veterans\u2019 clubs, PTAs, and\nmany other kinds of organizations and associations, individuals find\nconnections to one another and build a sense of community and solidar-\nity that leads to greater enthusiasm for community life. This trust, or\n\u201csocial capital,\u201d represents a critical reservoir of good will and serves as\n\n29\n\n\n\na catalyst for civic and political engagement. Second, nonprofits pro-\nmote civic engagement directly by offering individuals a door that opens\nonto the public square and a tool for demonstrating commitment to\nsomething greater than narrow self-interest. Civic engagement skills are\nlearned and honed through nonprofit and voluntary action. Third, non-\nprofits translate trust and civic engagement into direct political action by\norganizing people at the grassroots around interests and causes, by regis-\ntering voters and spurring them to get out the vote, and by organizing\ntown hall meetings and a host of other participation and empower-\nment activities aimed at bringing the individual into the public sphere.\nFourth, nonprofits are linked to politics through advocacy work. Orga-\nnized around broad issues and concerns, nonprofits play an important\nrole in informing and educating the public and policymakers. Advocacy\nefforts take place at the local, state, national, and transnational levels.\nFifth, nonprofits engage in direct lobbying around specific legislative\nissues. Almost every time government moves forward with a decision,\nlobbying on both sides of the issue occurs. Different from advocacy\nin that it focuses on specific bills of legislation, lobbying is a way to\ntranslate public concerns into legislative action. Sixth, nonprofits figure\nprominently in our electoral system. Campaign fundraising organiza-\ntions, political action committees, and a range of party institutions are\nall tax-exempt organizations. In recent years, cynicism about the role of\nmoneyed interests in politics has raised some difficult questions about\nthis particular function of nonprofits.\n\nAs they work to build cohesion in communities and as they speak out\non issues, nonprofits enjoy freedom of association and speech under the\nFirst Amendment. While nonprofits have often had an adversarial rela-\ntionship with government, the diverse forms of their political activity\nare still guaranteed government protection. No matter what causes they\nseek to advance, nonprofits do not risk the loss of their protected status\nas long as they follow a few basic rules when exerting their fundamental\nrights to speech and association. There is no test of reasonableness when\nit comes to the political views of nonprofits, nor are there prohibitions\non coalitions\u2019 forming behind any peaceful cause imaginable. Of course,\nthis has led to the advocacy of policies and agendas that have been con-\ntroversial, often because they challenged majority positions.

Many libraries also offer digital lending services.\n\n2. **Open Educational Resources (OER)**: These are freely accessible and openly licensed text, media, and other digital assets useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes. Websites like OER Commons provide access to a range of textbooks and educational materials.\n\n3. **Online Platforms**: Some websites like Project Gutenberg offer free ebooks, mainly for literature and other public domain works.\n\n4. **Book Swaps or Sharing**: Sometimes other students in your school might be willing to lend or sell their textbooks at a much lower price. Check student forums, bulletin boards, and social media groups for your university.\n\n5. **Publishers&#x27; Websites**: Some publishers might offer a free PDF download or a low-cost version of the textbook for students. It&#x27;s worth checking the official website of the textbook&#x27;s publisher.\n\n6. **Academic Databases**: Your university might have subscriptions to academic databases that include access to books, journal articles, and other scholarly resources.\n\nAlways make sure to respect copyright laws and the authors\u2019 rights when sourcing your textbooks."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

You don\u2019t believe me? See what our employees think here.\n\nWhat\u2019s JLS Like?\nYou Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don\u2019t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you\u2019re not \u2013 you can just be you.\n\nMajor Opportunities for Career Growth. We don\u2019t want to settle for just being a small business \u2013 we plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done. If you\u2019re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We\u2019re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you\u2019re gonna like it here.\n\nStrongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it\u2019s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within a few weeks of getting hired (seriously).\n\nComplete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\nFull-Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.\n\nNo Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFlexible Work Hours. This doesn\u2019t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I\u2019m skeptical)? This is the place for you.\n\nSupportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard but is 100% happy to help you if you\u2019re running into trouble.\n\nNo Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can\u2019t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.\n\nLots of Raises (for People Who Kick Ass). We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don\u2019t have to ask for one. It\u2019s not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\nHealth Insurance. Get access to our (pretty darned good) health insurance from the day you start. Or if you\u2019re outside the US, then get reimbursed monthly for finding your own health insurance.\n\nNo Assholes Allowed. We try very, very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.\n\nRegular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Feedback is really, really important here. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don\u2019t bullshit \u2013 when you\u2019re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to improve. And when you\u2019re doing well, we do our best to tell you.\n\nWe\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want everyone in the company to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\nHow Much Will I Learn?\nSo, so much! We can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll learn more in your first 6 months than you did during your entire school career. We have literally thousands of internal training documents, and spend lots and lots of effort helping people learn new skills.\n\nIf you want a taste, then here is the founder\u2019s list of publicly available documents. There are another 1,500+ things only available to JLS folks, and we add 50+ new things per month on average.\n\nBasically, if learning is one of your priorities in an employer, then we are absolutely the place for you.\n\nWhat Is JLS\u2019s Mission?\nIn short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).\n\nWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re successful at achieving this goal when:\n\n1. We have the right people on the bus and they\u2019re in the right seats.\n\n2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.\n\n3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn\u2019t dream of working anywhere else.\n\n4. Our customers love us.\n\n5. We\u2019re having a ton of fun.\n\n6. We\u2019re making a ton of money.\n\nAll of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success. This business doesn\u2019t exist to make the founder rich, though that will hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of these things and won\u2019t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.\n\nWhat Are Your Values?\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly, so if you don\u2019t 100% agree with these, then we aren\u2019t the place for you. Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:\n\n\nDo You Have a Detailed Company Vision?\nCheck it out here.\n\nCan I See Some Interviews with Your People?\nFor sure. See JLS Employee Testimonials.\n\nWhy Is Your Website Ugly? You Do Realize It\u2019s Not 1999 Right?\nOK first off, ouch. I\u2019ll have you know that the founder\u2019s college roommate\u2019s teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.\n\nSecond, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate. I\u2019ll bet from this single page, you\u2019ll learn more about our company than the last 10 companies you looked at put together, even if your eyes bleed in the process!\n\nFurther, we don\u2019t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She\u2019s no fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of the Company?\nHere is a carefully-crafted, undoubtedly white-washed history of the enigma known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nCan You Share Employee Feedback from Your Annual Company Survey?\nSee some key results and direct feedback from current employees here (including their criticisms \u2013 we really mean it when we say there\u2019s no BS). Some responses have been removed for including personally identifiable information or if it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to share the feedback publicly, but otherwise, results are posted as-is. This is probably a very informative tool for hearing what real-life employees have to say about us.\n\nAre You Hiring?\nIf we are hiring, then you can see our active jobs here: Link.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any jobs that look right for you, don\u2019t worry. We are always looking to add smart and capable people to our team. You can fill out our General Application Form, and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out.\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to be informed when there is a new open position at JLS Trading Co., feel free to sign up for our Open Positions Newsletter and we will make sure to send you one of our highly trained messenger pigeons. Yes, pigeons! Have you looked at this website? What did you expect?\n\nCan I Work Remotely (Even World-Wide)?\nFor office/knowledge-work jobs: 100%. In fact, we want to be a remote-only company as much as reasonably possible, if only to save on rent because the CEO is cheap AF, but more so because working remotely is on-balance so much better for everyone involved. Imagine never having to commute or wear pants ever again!\n\nMost of our employees are in the USA, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way. We currently work with people in multiple US states, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Argentina, India, Mexico, and more (we\u2019re too lazy to update this list as we grow, FYI). We legitimately don\u2019t care where you live, as long as you\u2019re fucking awesome at your job (and really fucking nice).\n\nUnfortunately, the geo-flexibility and work from home does not apply to inventory/production-related jobs, where we have to have you on-site, since you have to physically interact with product. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wish there were some way to make it work.\n\nBut for computer work, we 100% encourage/demand that you do it at home. We\u2019ll buy you a laptop and give you money to get your home office set up, too.\n\nHow Many People Do You Have?\nHere is our live breakdown because we got tired of manually updating this page. As of Summer 2021, around 40% of our folks work in the warehouse getting things out the door, and the rest work remotely doing office/marketing/other stuff (like making sure the founder knows he\u2019s an idiot). Around 2/3 of our remote/office staff work outside the USA.\n\nAre You Fashion Forward?\nYou bet your ass:\n\n\nWhat Are the Hours Like?\nProduction/inventory jobs have stricter start times than others (it\u2019s the nature of the beast unfortunately), but almost all other jobs offer flexible hours. We don\u2019t care exactly when you work, so long as you get your work done. If you want to start at 7:00 AM, fantastic. If you want to start at 10:00 AM, by all means. If you want to go to the gym at 1:00 PM, good on you. If you want to go see your kid\u2019s T-Ball game, well\u2026 Bring beer because those are just awful.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re absolutely crushing it, we basically don\u2019t give a shit when you clock in or out (some jobs have tighter work windows though).\n\nIn our humble (but obviously right) opinion, there are three types of people:\n\n1. People who cannot possibly be effective regularly working 60+ hours per week\n\n2. Liars\n\n3. Cocaine addicts\n\nSo, for us, hourly full-time employees are expected to work a minimum of 38 hours per week and full-time salaried employees are expected to work around 40-45 hours per week. If you have to go over that number regularly, you\u2019re gonna get yelled at.\n\nIs There Opportunity for Advancement?\nOh man, is there ever. Our ambitions are limitless (see the vision for more details). We aren\u2019t just growing with GDP \u2013 we are trying to grow 100% a year for basically eternity, which categorically means that if you\u2019re smart and capable (like really smart and capable), then you will never want for more opportunities. Presuming you are damned good, then you will get as much opportunity and responsibility as you want (and maybe more than that).\n\nIf you want to advance probably 10x faster than a normal corporate job, we are the place for you.\n\nIs the Company Actually Growing Fast?\nYou Decide. Revenue by Year:\n\n2014 \u2013 $354k\n\n2015 \u2013 $1.35m\n\n2016 \u2013 $2.2m\n\n2017 \u2013 $3.3m\n\n2018 \u2013 $5.6m\n\n2019 \u2013 $9.7m\n\n2020 \u2013 $10.6 (2020 was\u2026interesting)\n\n2021 \u2013 $17.3m\n\n2022 \u2013 $19m\n\nWe share revenue numbers to increase the chances that high-quality people don\u2019t think that we\u2019re full of shit. All this growth means that there are lots and lots of opportunities for capable, ambitious people. Plus all financials are shared with all employees on a monthly basis so everyone knows exactly where the company is at \u2013 the No Bullshit value is just that: No Bullshit.\n\nWhere Do You Store Your Male Models?\nIn multiple locations around the warehouse:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Testimonials\nSee our reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google. And check out the survey results above for more direct feedback from employees.\n\nFrom John P:\n\nJLS has been the greatest place to work in my life. I love working here because I am challenged on a daily basis to do new and interesting things, I am given the freedom to figure out how to do those things, and I know that I can trust in my very reasonable and thoughtful management team. It\u2019s a new company with a lot of opportunities, in the sense that, we\u2019re always looking for a better way to do things, so as somebody that likes to think of new methods and test them out, I\u2019m very happy because I can try new things and new ways of doing things.\n\nFrom Ben W:\n\nI previously worked in corporate America and never had any idea how what I did impacted the company\u2019s success. Now, I am working in a company where everyone from the owner to the newest hire meets weekly to review individual and company successes, failures, and lessons learned. Knowing why what I do matters while working with smart people in a culture that pushes me to improve myself on a day to day basis has been a revelation, and I look forward to continuing to take part in the growth of the business for years to come.\n\nFrom Drew B:\n\nJLS has by far been the best place I have ever worked. My work/life balance has never been better, and everyone seems to genuinely care about my personal happiness. My job history has spanned a wide variety of businesses and industries. I have even run my own business. It wasn\u2019t until I came to JLS that I realized how important a good culture fit can be. We expect a lot out of each other, and we work hard at being a unified team.\n\nWhat Is Turnover Like?\nVoluntary turnover is super low. Like super, super low. The things that cause people to be asked to leave are:\n\n1. Values non-fit. We joke around a lot, but we take our values very seriously.\n\n2. They can\u2019t do the job. We are stringent that you have to kick ass. We will absolutely give you the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, but if you\u2019re not a smart mofo, then we\u2019re forced to act for the good of the group.\n\nHowever, because we\u2019re a high-feedback environment, you will absolutely know ahead of time what your boss thinks about your performance and what you need to do to improve.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t You on Social Media?\n1. The founder refuses to upgrade his mobile device from his TI-83 and LinkedIn stupidly hasn\u2019t released an app for it yet.\n\n2. Have you, like, ever been on social media? It\u2019s awful.\n\n3. We keep getting kicked off of Myspace for being \u201ctoo emo\u201d which honestly just makes us even more emo.\n\n4. We probably will at some point, but mostly we\u2019re just lazy.\n\nHow Many Meetings Are There?\nAs few as fucking possible. We do everything we can to encourage people to just email vs doing a quick chat or a meeting, so there are very, very few set meetings in the company. Amongst the worst feedback a manager can receive is that they regularly hold meetings that could have been an email. It\u2019s pretty nice to not have to sit through useless, bullshit meetings and just have to read the founder\u2019s useless, bullshit emails instead.\n\nWho Is JLS Not For?\nThis is a good question. JLS is probably not for you if you:\n\n\u2013 Want a stable job that doesn\u2019t change very often\n\n\u2013 Like the security that comes from working for a very large company\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy building things, and all that comes along with that\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t believe that everything can be optimized, for basically forever\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy discovering the truth through friendly back and forth discussion\n\n\u2013 Care about status\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like really considering other people\u2019s feelings before doing things\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like wearing multiple hats\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like dealing with ambiguity/the unknown\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like being in a place that is very careful about not wasting resources\n\n\u2013 Thrive in a political rather than a results-based environment\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy letting your guard down and just being yourself with your coworkers\n\nWe are definitely not for everyone. We are effectively a startup that is trying to be a giant company, which clearly has trade-offs, but if all of that isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you, then why not take a shot and apply?\n\nWhat Kind of Car Does the CEO Drive?\nWell first off, the CEO refuses to leave the house/put pants on, so there is some internal debate as to whether or not he actually exists.\n\nBut when he does leave the house, he drives his sexy AF 2004 Toyota 4Runner or his wife\u2019s 2008 Toyota Sienna, which is slightly less sexy but has so much room for activities. Probably don\u2019t ask him about the cars though, unless you want a 30-minute lecture on why high-mileage Toyotas are hands-down the best value on the planet.\n\nDo You Believe in Work-Life Balance?\nWork Life Balance at JLS Trading Co.\n\nThe above never happens at JLS \u2013 we instituted a rule saying you can\u2019t stab people in the head a long time ago. Sometimes we amaze ourselves at how generous we are.\n\nWork/Life Balance is one of the core benefits of working at JLS. We want happy, productive employees who work hard, but enjoy their lives outside of work. See the \u201cHours\u201d section above for more details. Pretty much, as long as you\u2019re getting a lot of shit done, we\u2019re never gonna sweat you on hours. If you\u2019re sick, take the day. If your kid is sick, take the day. We 100% believe that family and friends come first and that no one can live optimally working 80 hour weeks.\n\nIf you want to kick ass at your job while still having a really good work-life balance, then JLS is very likely the place for you.\n\nHow Are You Funded?\nWe are 100% self-funded. There are no venture capitalists pulling the strings. We answer to ourselves, and can do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the company and all of its stakeholders versus just optimizing for saleability.\n\nAre You a Cult?\nNo no no\u2026 We are an organization that promotes love.\n\nAre You Planning to Get Big Then Sell the Company?\nWe are planning to get big, yes, but we have absolutely no plans to sell. The founder views JLS as his life\u2019s work. We may eventually sell off individual assets, like product lines, but there is absolutely no intention of ever selling the whole company. You don\u2019t need to worry about private equity MBAs coming in and ruining everything, the founder does that all by himself.\n\nDo You Give Raises Often?\nWe very, very rarely have to have someone ask for raise to get one. Seriously. We do our absolute best to get ahead of it. Cheaping out on good people is not a recipe for long-term success. If you\u2019re kicking ass at your job and taking on more and more responsibility, then a raise is basically inevitable. We\u2019ve had people who have had their salaries nearly double in under 6 months because they proved to be so awesome \u2013 this is not typical but it\u2019s definitely possible. We want you thinking about how to kick ass, not how to pay the bills.\n\nDo You Have Nap Facilities On-Site?\nDo you think this is amateur hour? Of course we do:\n\n\n\nHow Will I Be Evaluated?\nWe want everyone to know exactly what they have to do to be successful. Every employee has a detailed list of the behaviors and outcomes that constitute success. You\u2019ll have a weekly One-on-One with your manager, regular feedback (if you could be doing anything better), and an official quarterly evaluation. This is definitely not a place where you only get feedback once a year.\n\nIs It True You Have to Tell the CEO to Go Fuck Himself?\nThat. Is. Absolutely. Completely. Ridiculous.\n\nI Am an Engineer. Is JLS the Place for Me?\nWe are still early days when it comes to building an engineering team, but we think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll like it a lot here:\n\n\u2013 The CEO understands the maker vs manager schedule\n\n\u2013 The CEO has been the de-facto head engineer and IT guy for his whole life, so his chance of \u201cgetting it\u201d is much higher than normal\n\n\u2013 Full-time remote work, so you can work when and where you want (no cubicle or open office bullshit \u2013 fuck that noise)\n\n\u2013 No/minimal interruptions \u2013 we loathe unnecessary meetings and recognize that the only way to get a lot done is long stretches of deep work\n\n\u2013 Engineers are treated with respect and admiration\n\n\u2013 We are committed to passing the Joel Test\n\n\u2013 No politics \u2013 personal considerations will not outweigh the technical considerations\n\n\u2013 We won\u2019t fight you on using whatever technology you need \u2013 within reason\n\n\u2013 We\u2019ll invest in your training and education \u2013 buy whatever books and courses you want on the company dime\n\n\u2013 No crunch\n\nWe want to make a worker\u2019s paradise, which certainly includes engineers. We think you\u2019ll like it a lot here.\n\nWhat Type of Toilet Paper Do You Provide?\nNow I know you\u2019re thinking, what kind of weird fucking place advertises the toilet paper they use, but we believe it\u2019s actually a good indicator of if a company cares or not. We\u2019ve all used that horrible 1-ply junk that isn\u2019t even fit for prisons. Because we care about our employees, we use the thick, rippled Cottonelle (or equivalent \u2013 we choose whatever the best option is available at Costco when we go). And now you get to say to people that this random company tried to convert you to applying for a job by saying that its toilet paper was good. What a time to be alive!\n\nIs This Utopia?\nLife is definitely really nice here, but no, it\u2019s not utopia or some socialist paradise. It is a pretty great place to work, and for nearly everyone who works here, it\u2019s the best place they\u2019ve ever worked by far, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re perfect. Everything is a constant work in progress. We are lead and staffed by people, and people are imperfect. Emails still get missed, tasks still get dropped, and the CEO still randomly flings feces from time to time. We\u2019re human here, but we are also doing our absolute best to be great to each other. It\u2019ll be a never ending process, but damnit we\u2019re trying.\n\nWhy Do You Swear So much?\nMy gut reaction was to say, \u201cBecause fuck you. That\u2019s why.\u201d But I stopped myself. From our Values Document:\n\nProfessionalism impedes communication by putting an invisible wall between two people. It\u2019s so much harder to communicate effectively if you have to couch your language in corporate-speak. Let your guard down and be real with people. If you can\u2019t joke around with your coworkers, what\u2019s the fucking point?\n\nAlso:\n\nFuck Is a Great Word\n\nI Applied, but I Haven\u2019t Heard Back. What\u2019s the Deal?\nIf you applied straight through Indeed.com (or similar job site) and not through our custom process (it would be a \u201cApplyToJob.com\u201d URL), then we have not seen your application. We try to make it clear to apply through our custom link, and not through the website, but sometimes people miss it (it\u2019s literally the first thing in the job ad, though).\n\nIf you did apply through our custom process, then please check your spam. We do indeed respond to everyone but often, our emails go to spam, which is really annoying. If you still can\u2019t find a response, please email us \u2013 I promise we are not purposefully messing with you.\n\nWhy Is Your Careers Page so FUCKING Long?\nYou should see our onboarding documentation! You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nWe really want you to know what you\u2019re potentially getting into. The founder has been called many things \u2013 the most humble person on the planet, guy who gets paid by the word, tax evader, etc. But he has never been called out for getting someone invested into something under false circumstances. We want you to know exactly what kind of people we are, so that you can decide for yourself if we\u2019re the right place for you (we think we\u2019re pretty great, but we\u2019re also definitely not for everyone).\n\nOur hiring process is hard, and if you\u2019re potentially leaving a good job to come here, we want you to be quite sure that you\u2019re making a good decision. So, we write a lot!\n\nPlus, haven\u2019t you enjoyed reading through this fever dream of a job site?\n\nIs This Seriously a Real Place?\nYup! And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! I know it sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s okay. Many of our employees thought the same way at first. Plus, get this: the owner just started paying everyone with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons \u2013 we\u2019re big time, people. Concluding video from the CEO to convince you. I guess the best 3-word-definition of JLS (which is written by a candidate) is:\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 902cc76ed5921f6cc8cfa2fad10f80d55bfe2ec3-1.png\n\nThank you!\n\nHow Do I Apply?\nGlad you\u2019re interested! Near the bottom of our posts on the various job boards, you will find a link to an application form. Open that link, fill out the form, and you\u2019ll be in our system. We get back to everyone, so please check your spam folder if you haven\u2019t heard from us. Good luck and thank you for your time!\n\nOther Questions?

It emphasizes a casual, direct, and somewhat irreverent tone, suggesting a workplace that values transparency, individuality, and a lack of bureaucracy.

The company also emphasizes continuous learning and growth, providing extensive internal resources and training opportunities.\n\nThe recruitment strategy is clearly aimed at attracting a specific type of employee\u2014someone who is results-driven, comfortable with a high degree of freedom and responsibility, and fits into a culture that is relaxed yet demanding. The page also makes it clear that traditional corporate individuals concerned with stability and a conventional hierarchy may not find JLS to be the right fit.\n\nOverall, JLS Trading Co. appears to be seeking to attract innovative and driven individuals who thrive in a dynamic and unconventional setting, and who are eager to contribute to a company that promises to be both challenging and rewarding."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

You don\u2019t believe me? See what our employees think here.\n\nWhat\u2019s JLS Like?\nYou Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don\u2019t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you\u2019re not \u2013 you can just be you.\n\nMajor Opportunities for Career Growth. We don\u2019t want to settle for just being a small business \u2013 we plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done. If you\u2019re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We\u2019re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you\u2019re gonna like it here.\n\nStrongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it\u2019s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within a few weeks of getting hired (seriously).\n\nComplete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\nFull-Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.\n\nNo Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFlexible Work Hours. This doesn\u2019t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I\u2019m skeptical)? This is the place for you.\n\nSupportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard but is 100% happy to help you if you\u2019re running into trouble.\n\nNo Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can\u2019t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.\n\nLots of Raises (for People Who Kick Ass). We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don\u2019t have to ask for one. It\u2019s not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\nHealth Insurance. Get access to our (pretty darned good) health insurance from the day you start. Or if you\u2019re outside the US, then get reimbursed monthly for finding your own health insurance.\n\nNo Assholes Allowed. We try very, very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.\n\nRegular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Feedback is really, really important here. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don\u2019t bullshit \u2013 when you\u2019re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to improve. And when you\u2019re doing well, we do our best to tell you.\n\nWe\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want everyone in the company to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\nHow Much Will I Learn?\nSo, so much! We can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll learn more in your first 6 months than you did during your entire school career. We have literally thousands of internal training documents, and spend lots and lots of effort helping people learn new skills.\n\nIf you want a taste, then here is the founder\u2019s list of publicly available documents. There are another 1,500+ things only available to JLS folks, and we add 50+ new things per month on average.\n\nBasically, if learning is one of your priorities in an employer, then we are absolutely the place for you.\n\nWhat Is JLS\u2019s Mission?\nIn short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).\n\nWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re successful at achieving this goal when:\n\n1. We have the right people on the bus and they\u2019re in the right seats.\n\n2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.\n\n3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn\u2019t dream of working anywhere else.\n\n4. Our customers love us.\n\n5. We\u2019re having a ton of fun.\n\n6. We\u2019re making a ton of money.\n\nAll of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success. This business doesn\u2019t exist to make the founder rich, though that will hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of these things and won\u2019t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.\n\nWhat Are Your Values?\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly, so if you don\u2019t 100% agree with these, then we aren\u2019t the place for you. Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:\n\n\nDo You Have a Detailed Company Vision?\nCheck it out here.\n\nCan I See Some Interviews with Your People?\nFor sure. See JLS Employee Testimonials.\n\nWhy Is Your Website Ugly? You Do Realize It\u2019s Not 1999 Right?\nOK first off, ouch. I\u2019ll have you know that the founder\u2019s college roommate\u2019s teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.\n\nSecond, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate. I\u2019ll bet from this single page, you\u2019ll learn more about our company than the last 10 companies you looked at put together, even if your eyes bleed in the process!\n\nFurther, we don\u2019t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She\u2019s no fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of the Company?\nHere is a carefully-crafted, undoubtedly white-washed history of the enigma known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nCan You Share Employee Feedback from Your Annual Company Survey?\nSee some key results and direct feedback from current employees here (including their criticisms \u2013 we really mean it when we say there\u2019s no BS). Some responses have been removed for including personally identifiable information or if it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to share the feedback publicly, but otherwise, results are posted as-is. This is probably a very informative tool for hearing what real-life employees have to say about us.\n\nAre You Hiring?\nIf we are hiring, then you can see our active jobs here: Link.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any jobs that look right for you, don\u2019t worry. We are always looking to add smart and capable people to our team. You can fill out our General Application Form, and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out.\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to be informed when there is a new open position at JLS Trading Co., feel free to sign up for our Open Positions Newsletter and we will make sure to send you one of our highly trained messenger pigeons. Yes, pigeons! Have you looked at this website? What did you expect?\n\nCan I Work Remotely (Even World-Wide)?\nFor office/knowledge-work jobs: 100%. In fact, we want to be a remote-only company as much as reasonably possible, if only to save on rent because the CEO is cheap AF, but more so because working remotely is on-balance so much better for everyone involved. Imagine never having to commute or wear pants ever again!\n\nMost of our employees are in the USA, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way. We currently work with people in multiple US states, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Argentina, India, Mexico, and more (we\u2019re too lazy to update this list as we grow, FYI). We legitimately don\u2019t care where you live, as long as you\u2019re fucking awesome at your job (and really fucking nice).\n\nUnfortunately, the geo-flexibility and work from home does not apply to inventory/production-related jobs, where we have to have you on-site, since you have to physically interact with product. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wish there were some way to make it work.\n\nBut for computer work, we 100% encourage/demand that you do it at home. We\u2019ll buy you a laptop and give you money to get your home office set up, too.\n\nHow Many People Do You Have?\nHere is our live breakdown because we got tired of manually updating this page. As of Summer 2021, around 40% of our folks work in the warehouse getting things out the door, and the rest work remotely doing office/marketing/other stuff (like making sure the founder knows he\u2019s an idiot). Around 2/3 of our remote/office staff work outside the USA.\n\nAre You Fashion Forward?\nYou bet your ass:\n\n\nWhat Are the Hours Like?\nProduction/inventory jobs have stricter start times than others (it\u2019s the nature of the beast unfortunately), but almost all other jobs offer flexible hours. We don\u2019t care exactly when you work, so long as you get your work done. If you want to start at 7:00 AM, fantastic. If you want to start at 10:00 AM, by all means. If you want to go to the gym at 1:00 PM, good on you. If you want to go see your kid\u2019s T-Ball game, well\u2026 Bring beer because those are just awful.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re absolutely crushing it, we basically don\u2019t give a shit when you clock in or out (some jobs have tighter work windows though).\n\nIn our humble (but obviously right) opinion, there are three types of people:\n\n1. People who cannot possibly be effective regularly working 60+ hours per week\n\n2. Liars\n\n3. Cocaine addicts\n\nSo, for us, hourly full-time employees are expected to work a minimum of 38 hours per week and full-time salaried employees are expected to work around 40-45 hours per week. If you have to go over that number regularly, you\u2019re gonna get yelled at.\n\nIs There Opportunity for Advancement?\nOh man, is there ever. Our ambitions are limitless (see the vision for more details). We aren\u2019t just growing with GDP \u2013 we are trying to grow 100% a year for basically eternity, which categorically means that if you\u2019re smart and capable (like really smart and capable), then you will never want for more opportunities. Presuming you are damned good, then you will get as much opportunity and responsibility as you want (and maybe more than that).\n\nIf you want to advance probably 10x faster than a normal corporate job, we are the place for you.\n\nIs the Company Actually Growing Fast?\nYou Decide. Revenue by Year:\n\n2014 \u2013 $354k\n\n2015 \u2013 $1.35m\n\n2016 \u2013 $2.2m\n\n2017 \u2013 $3.3m\n\n2018 \u2013 $5.6m\n\n2019 \u2013 $9.7m\n\n2020 \u2013 $10.6 (2020 was\u2026interesting)\n\n2021 \u2013 $17.3m\n\n2022 \u2013 $19m\n\nWe share revenue numbers to increase the chances that high-quality people don\u2019t think that we\u2019re full of shit. All this growth means that there are lots and lots of opportunities for capable, ambitious people. Plus all financials are shared with all employees on a monthly basis so everyone knows exactly where the company is at \u2013 the No Bullshit value is just that: No Bullshit.\n\nWhere Do You Store Your Male Models?\nIn multiple locations around the warehouse:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Testimonials\nSee our reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google. And check out the survey results above for more direct feedback from employees.\n\nFrom John P:\n\nJLS has been the greatest place to work in my life. I love working here because I am challenged on a daily basis to do new and interesting things, I am given the freedom to figure out how to do those things, and I know that I can trust in my very reasonable and thoughtful management team. It\u2019s a new company with a lot of opportunities, in the sense that, we\u2019re always looking for a better way to do things, so as somebody that likes to think of new methods and test them out, I\u2019m very happy because I can try new things and new ways of doing things.\n\nFrom Ben W:\n\nI previously worked in corporate America and never had any idea how what I did impacted the company\u2019s success. Now, I am working in a company where everyone from the owner to the newest hire meets weekly to review individual and company successes, failures, and lessons learned. Knowing why what I do matters while working with smart people in a culture that pushes me to improve myself on a day to day basis has been a revelation, and I look forward to continuing to take part in the growth of the business for years to come.\n\nFrom Drew B:\n\nJLS has by far been the best place I have ever worked. My work/life balance has never been better, and everyone seems to genuinely care about my personal happiness. My job history has spanned a wide variety of businesses and industries. I have even run my own business. It wasn\u2019t until I came to JLS that I realized how important a good culture fit can be. We expect a lot out of each other, and we work hard at being a unified team.\n\nWhat Is Turnover Like?\nVoluntary turnover is super low. Like super, super low. The things that cause people to be asked to leave are:\n\n1. Values non-fit. We joke around a lot, but we take our values very seriously.\n\n2. They can\u2019t do the job. We are stringent that you have to kick ass. We will absolutely give you the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, but if you\u2019re not a smart mofo, then we\u2019re forced to act for the good of the group.\n\nHowever, because we\u2019re a high-feedback environment, you will absolutely know ahead of time what your boss thinks about your performance and what you need to do to improve.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t You on Social Media?\n1. The founder refuses to upgrade his mobile device from his TI-83 and LinkedIn stupidly hasn\u2019t released an app for it yet.\n\n2. Have you, like, ever been on social media? It\u2019s awful.\n\n3. We keep getting kicked off of Myspace for being \u201ctoo emo\u201d which honestly just makes us even more emo.\n\n4. We probably will at some point, but mostly we\u2019re just lazy.\n\nHow Many Meetings Are There?\nAs few as fucking possible. We do everything we can to encourage people to just email vs doing a quick chat or a meeting, so there are very, very few set meetings in the company. Amongst the worst feedback a manager can receive is that they regularly hold meetings that could have been an email. It\u2019s pretty nice to not have to sit through useless, bullshit meetings and just have to read the founder\u2019s useless, bullshit emails instead.\n\nWho Is JLS Not For?\nThis is a good question. JLS is probably not for you if you:\n\n\u2013 Want a stable job that doesn\u2019t change very often\n\n\u2013 Like the security that comes from working for a very large company\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy building things, and all that comes along with that\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t believe that everything can be optimized, for basically forever\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy discovering the truth through friendly back and forth discussion\n\n\u2013 Care about status\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like really considering other people\u2019s feelings before doing things\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like wearing multiple hats\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like dealing with ambiguity/the unknown\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like being in a place that is very careful about not wasting resources\n\n\u2013 Thrive in a political rather than a results-based environment\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy letting your guard down and just being yourself with your coworkers\n\nWe are definitely not for everyone. We are effectively a startup that is trying to be a giant company, which clearly has trade-offs, but if all of that isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you, then why not take a shot and apply?\n\nWhat Kind of Car Does the CEO Drive?\nWell first off, the CEO refuses to leave the house/put pants on, so there is some internal debate as to whether or not he actually exists.\n\nBut when he does leave the house, he drives his sexy AF 2004 Toyota 4Runner or his wife\u2019s 2008 Toyota Sienna, which is slightly less sexy but has so much room for activities. Probably don\u2019t ask him about the cars though, unless you want a 30-minute lecture on why high-mileage Toyotas are hands-down the best value on the planet.\n\nDo You Believe in Work-Life Balance?\nWork Life Balance at JLS Trading Co.\n\nThe above never happens at JLS \u2013 we instituted a rule saying you can\u2019t stab people in the head a long time ago. Sometimes we amaze ourselves at how generous we are.\n\nWork/Life Balance is one of the core benefits of working at JLS. We want happy, productive employees who work hard, but enjoy their lives outside of work. See the \u201cHours\u201d section above for more details. Pretty much, as long as you\u2019re getting a lot of shit done, we\u2019re never gonna sweat you on hours. If you\u2019re sick, take the day. If your kid is sick, take the day. We 100% believe that family and friends come first and that no one can live optimally working 80 hour weeks.\n\nIf you want to kick ass at your job while still having a really good work-life balance, then JLS is very likely the place for you.\n\nHow Are You Funded?\nWe are 100% self-funded. There are no venture capitalists pulling the strings. We answer to ourselves, and can do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the company and all of its stakeholders versus just optimizing for saleability.\n\nAre You a Cult?\nNo no no\u2026 We are an organization that promotes love.\n\nAre You Planning to Get Big Then Sell the Company?\nWe are planning to get big, yes, but we have absolutely no plans to sell. The founder views JLS as his life\u2019s work. We may eventually sell off individual assets, like product lines, but there is absolutely no intention of ever selling the whole company. You don\u2019t need to worry about private equity MBAs coming in and ruining everything, the founder does that all by himself.\n\nDo You Give Raises Often?\nWe very, very rarely have to have someone ask for raise to get one. Seriously. We do our absolute best to get ahead of it. Cheaping out on good people is not a recipe for long-term success. If you\u2019re kicking ass at your job and taking on more and more responsibility, then a raise is basically inevitable. We\u2019ve had people who have had their salaries nearly double in under 6 months because they proved to be so awesome \u2013 this is not typical but it\u2019s definitely possible. We want you thinking about how to kick ass, not how to pay the bills.\n\nDo You Have Nap Facilities On-Site?\nDo you think this is amateur hour? Of course we do:\n\n\n\nHow Will I Be Evaluated?\nWe want everyone to know exactly what they have to do to be successful. Every employee has a detailed list of the behaviors and outcomes that constitute success. You\u2019ll have a weekly One-on-One with your manager, regular feedback (if you could be doing anything better), and an official quarterly evaluation. This is definitely not a place where you only get feedback once a year.\n\nIs It True You Have to Tell the CEO to Go Fuck Himself?\nThat. Is. Absolutely. Completely. Ridiculous.\n\nI Am an Engineer. Is JLS the Place for Me?\nWe are still early days when it comes to building an engineering team, but we think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll like it a lot here:\n\n\u2013 The CEO understands the maker vs manager schedule\n\n\u2013 The CEO has been the de-facto head engineer and IT guy for his whole life, so his chance of \u201cgetting it\u201d is much higher than normal\n\n\u2013 Full-time remote work, so you can work when and where you want (no cubicle or open office bullshit \u2013 fuck that noise)\n\n\u2013 No/minimal interruptions \u2013 we loathe unnecessary meetings and recognize that the only way to get a lot done is long stretches of deep work\n\n\u2013 Engineers are treated with respect and admiration\n\n\u2013 We are committed to passing the Joel Test\n\n\u2013 No politics \u2013 personal considerations will not outweigh the technical considerations\n\n\u2013 We won\u2019t fight you on using whatever technology you need \u2013 within reason\n\n\u2013 We\u2019ll invest in your training and education \u2013 buy whatever books and courses you want on the company dime\n\n\u2013 No crunch\n\nWe want to make a worker\u2019s paradise, which certainly includes engineers. We think you\u2019ll like it a lot here.\n\nWhat Type of Toilet Paper Do You Provide?\nNow I know you\u2019re thinking, what kind of weird fucking place advertises the toilet paper they use, but we believe it\u2019s actually a good indicator of if a company cares or not. We\u2019ve all used that horrible 1-ply junk that isn\u2019t even fit for prisons. Because we care about our employees, we use the thick, rippled Cottonelle (or equivalent \u2013 we choose whatever the best option is available at Costco when we go). And now you get to say to people that this random company tried to convert you to applying for a job by saying that its toilet paper was good. What a time to be alive!\n\nIs This Utopia?\nLife is definitely really nice here, but no, it\u2019s not utopia or some socialist paradise. It is a pretty great place to work, and for nearly everyone who works here, it\u2019s the best place they\u2019ve ever worked by far, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re perfect. Everything is a constant work in progress. We are lead and staffed by people, and people are imperfect. Emails still get missed, tasks still get dropped, and the CEO still randomly flings feces from time to time. We\u2019re human here, but we are also doing our absolute best to be great to each other. It\u2019ll be a never ending process, but damnit we\u2019re trying.\n\nWhy Do You Swear So much?\nMy gut reaction was to say, \u201cBecause fuck you. That\u2019s why.\u201d But I stopped myself. From our Values Document:\n\nProfessionalism impedes communication by putting an invisible wall between two people. It\u2019s so much harder to communicate effectively if you have to couch your language in corporate-speak. Let your guard down and be real with people. If you can\u2019t joke around with your coworkers, what\u2019s the fucking point?\n\nAlso:\n\nFuck Is a Great Word\n\nI Applied, but I Haven\u2019t Heard Back. What\u2019s the Deal?\nIf you applied straight through Indeed.com (or similar job site) and not through our custom process (it would be a \u201cApplyToJob.com\u201d URL), then we have not seen your application. We try to make it clear to apply through our custom link, and not through the website, but sometimes people miss it (it\u2019s literally the first thing in the job ad, though).\n\nIf you did apply through our custom process, then please check your spam. We do indeed respond to everyone but often, our emails go to spam, which is really annoying. If you still can\u2019t find a response, please email us \u2013 I promise we are not purposefully messing with you.\n\nWhy Is Your Careers Page so FUCKING Long?\nYou should see our onboarding documentation! You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nWe really want you to know what you\u2019re potentially getting into. The founder has been called many things \u2013 the most humble person on the planet, guy who gets paid by the word, tax evader, etc. But he has never been called out for getting someone invested into something under false circumstances. We want you to know exactly what kind of people we are, so that you can decide for yourself if we\u2019re the right place for you (we think we\u2019re pretty great, but we\u2019re also definitely not for everyone).\n\nOur hiring process is hard, and if you\u2019re potentially leaving a good job to come here, we want you to be quite sure that you\u2019re making a good decision. So, we write a lot!\n\nPlus, haven\u2019t you enjoyed reading through this fever dream of a job site?\n\nIs This Seriously a Real Place?\nYup! And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! I know it sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s okay. Many of our employees thought the same way at first. Plus, get this: the owner just started paying everyone with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons \u2013 we\u2019re big time, people. Concluding video from the CEO to convince you. I guess the best 3-word-definition of JLS (which is written by a candidate) is:\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 902cc76ed5921f6cc8cfa2fad10f80d55bfe2ec3-1.png\n\nThank you!\n\nHow Do I Apply?\nGlad you\u2019re interested! Near the bottom of our posts on the various job boards, you will find a link to an application form. Open that link, fill out the form, and you\u2019ll be in our system. We get back to everyone, so please check your spam folder if you haven\u2019t heard from us. Good luck and thank you for your time!\n\nOther Questions? E-mail us: Careers@JLSTradingCo.com\n\nThis is the JLS careers page and  below is the job posting:\n\nIt for this job posting: \n\n- Do you enjoy learning about people, then judging them harshly?\n\n- Do you get off on finding diamonds in the rough?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\n \nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don\u2019t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\n \n----\n\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Here&#x27;s a refined and enhanced version of your answer to clearly articulate the impact of your initiative and highlight your strengths:\n\n&quot;In my previous role, I spearheaded a significant overhaul of our customer complaint handling process, specifically targeting complaints related to bus operators. Initially, we received an average of 50 to 100 complaints per month, often skewing towards the higher end. Recognizing the need for improvement, I implemented a new procedure that actively involved bus operators from the outset of each complaint investigation.\n\nInstead of approaching operators with pre-determined conclusions, we engaged them directly in reviewing incidents. This shift not only increased transparency but also fostered a more inclusive and collaborative environment. As a result, we observed a noticeable reduction in customer complaints\u2014down by 10 to 15%, with monthly figures dropping to between 50 and 85, more often on the lower side of that range.\n\nMore importantly, this change had a profound positive impact on bus operator satisfaction. In subsequent surveys, operators expressed significant appreciation for the new process, highlighting how being involved in the investigation phases made them feel respected and valued. This not only enhanced their job satisfaction but also improved their engagement and accountability, which contributed to the overall decrease in complaints.\n\nThis experience demonstrated my ability to lead change effectively, improving both customer satisfaction and employee engagement through strategic process adjustments.&quot; \n\nThis response clearly outlines the problem, the action you took, the results of your initiative, and the broader impact on the organization, positioning you as a proactive and thoughtful leader."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

We led the supervisors, which led the bus operators. Uh, we had a bit of a clunky process for handling, um, customer complaints that were related directly to a specific bus operator, where it was sort of like customer service would dip their toe in and do a little bit of investigation, like maybe look at the video and go from there, like to kind of give the customer that sort of satisfaction of, you know, answering their complaint right then and there if possible. But sort of for more graver matters, or maybe like if a bus operator had like a verbal altercation with a passenger or just different sort of issues, um, it might, that might provoke like disciplinary action. We needed to do like a thorough investigation about this, especially since many of our employees were, um, contract employees, meaning that, um, they worked under a collective bargaining agreement. And so we really needed to be clear in when we applied some sort of, uh, discipline to them or seeing that they violated any rules. And so anyway, long story short, um, I just felt like it was very clunky the way it would go through customer service. Then it would come to our department, our group, and, um, the service delivery managers would have to take all the customer complaints that were for their zone, like their part of the city that they handled, and, um, give them to the bus supervisors to fully investigate. What is investigation? They would pull the video from the bus, which included audio. They would interview the bus operator about the event, and, um, they would kind of, uh, review any sort of radio communication that might have occurred at the time and sort of to come to a conclusion about what might have occurred, if there were any sort of violations, et cetera. And then if we did find that there was something that was a violation and required disciplinary action, at that point, we needed to, um, initiate disciplinary proceedings. Like, um, basically it was like, uh, I forget what they called it. It was like, almost like court. Anyways, long story short, I thought this is too much. This is not helping customer service skills develop amongst bus operators. This is not an efficient way to do it because these investigations take time. Who is going to remember the conversation they had with a passenger? Maybe sometimes in passing, like they just told them, no, you can&#x27;t bring your, um, pet dog on the bus. Things like this, you know, things of this nature. Um, so what I thought would be better, and I kind of brought this to my manager and we implemented this plan, is that, um, you instead, customer service would give all of these customer complaints to us. We would, A, use it as, um, a learning experience for the bus operators, not so much a learning experience, but like, uh, uh, opportunity for development. And we would, instead of doing our own investigation alone, we would sit down with them in the very outset with the video and the customer complaint. And we&#x27;d sort of review the video, discuss it with them, see what their thoughts were and develop an action plan. And if we felt like, well, maybe like sometimes, a lot of times they said, oh, I was upset that day. But if they felt like they could have done a better job, we set up an action plan so that it never happens again. Um, if it&#x27;s something that is like a clear violation of rules, and then we need to continue with disciplinary proceedings, um, at times the action plan would stood in place, like this was their first try. And if they had a problem with this in the past, then we sort of proceed to the next step in the disciplinary process. And the action plan is just sort of irrelevant. But my idea was this action plan and this sit down meeting with them. And then a couple of weeks later, we would sit down with them again, just kind of checking in, see how they&#x27;re doing with it. And it was a great way to kind of touch bases with the employees to kind of get a pulse for them. And at the same time handle these customer complaints, because afterwards, we would go back to customer service, give them a full report kind of via email, mind you in the system. And sometimes they would have the kind of the go ahead to reach back out to the customer and if it warranted give them free stuff or whatever. In any case, this plan really had such a positive impact. We found that generally we would get regarding bus operates, we would get something like 50 to 100 complaints a month, you know, it ranged. Afterwards, and it was usually more towards the hundred, you know. Afterwards, though, we found that there was almost like a I would say about a 10 to 15% reduction in the sort of like customer complaint incidents where it&#x27;s directed at specifically a bus driver.

Here\u2019s a refined and structured version of your answer that highlights your role, the challenges, your solution, and the results more clearly:\n\n---\n\n&quot;As a Service Delivery Manager at Jacksonville Transportation Authority, I led operations and managed a team that included supervisors responsible for bus operators. One of the challenges we faced was handling customer complaints directed at bus operators, which involved a cumbersome and inefficient process that lacked clear and timely resolutions, especially in cases that could lead to disciplinary actions.\n\nInitially, customer service would conduct a preliminary investigation and, for more severe issues, pass the complaint to our department. We, the service delivery managers, then tasked supervisors with a full investigation, including video review, interviewing the bus operator, and examining radio communications. This lengthy process often delayed resolutions and didn\u2019t contribute to bus operators&#x27; development or customer satisfaction.\n\nRecognizing the inefficiencies and the opportunity for improvement, I proposed a more proactive approach. Instead of isolating the investigation to our internal team, we included bus operators early in the process. We transformed initial complaint reviews into collaborative sessions, where we discussed the incident with the operator using the video as a guide, assessed their perspective, and together developed an action plan aimed at preventing future occurrences. This approach not only expedited the resolution process but also served as a developmental tool for the operators.\n\nWe implemented this plan across the board, and it resulted in a significant decrease in customer complaints\u2014from an average of 100 per month to between 50 and 85, marking up to a 15% reduction. More importantly, it dramatically improved bus operator satisfaction, as reflected in internal surveys. Operators appreciated being involved from the outset, which helped them feel valued and understood within the organization.\n\nThis initiative not only streamlined our complaint handling process but also fostered a more positive and inclusive work environment, enhancing overall satisfaction and reducing conflict incidences.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis version of your response is more concise, focuses on your proactive leadership, and directly links your actions to measurable outcomes, effectively showcasing your problem-solving skills and your strategic approach to operational challenges."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Keeping it clean can help reduce anxiety about missing important communications.\n\n**Why Some People Don&#x27;t Practice Inbox Zero:**\n- **Time-Consuming**: Constantly managing emails can be seen as an interruption, detracting from more important work.\n- **Not Always Practical**: For those receiving a high volume of emails, reaching inbox zero daily may not be practical.\n- **Preference for Alternative Methods**: Some find other methods of email management more effective, such as using extensive labeling and folders, or setting specific times to check emails.\n\nWhether you should aim for Inbox Zero depends on your job role, email volume, personal work style, and how email impacts your productivity and stress levels.

The book breaks down Python into digestible segments, each designed to build a foundational understanding of key concepts and basic applications.\n\nWhat I found particularly valuable was the book&#x27;s emphasis on practical exercises and examples, which helped me transition from theory to practice at a comfortable pace. These exercises allowed me to apply what I learned in simple, real-world tasks, reinforcing my understanding and gradually increasing my confidence in using Python for basic programming tasks.\n\nThis learning journey has been instrumental in enhancing my analytical thinking and has sparked a deeper interest in data analysis, a skill I am keen to develop further. &#x27;Python All-in-One For Dummies&#x27; has not only expanded my technical skill set but also motivated me to continue learning and exploring Python programming, using tools like ChatGPT to supplement my studies and clarify complex topics.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis version presents you as a beginner who is actively engaged in learning Python, highlighting your initiative and willingness to explore new skills without overstating your current level of expertise.

You don\u2019t believe me? See what our employees think here.\n\nWhat\u2019s JLS Like?\nYou Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don\u2019t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you\u2019re not \u2013 you can just be you.\n\nMajor Opportunities for Career Growth. We don\u2019t want to settle for just being a small business \u2013 we plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done. If you\u2019re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We\u2019re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you\u2019re gonna like it here.\n\nStrongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it\u2019s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within a few weeks of getting hired (seriously).\n\nComplete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\nFull-Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.\n\nNo Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFlexible Work Hours. This doesn\u2019t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I\u2019m skeptical)? This is the place for you.\n\nSupportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard but is 100% happy to help you if you\u2019re running into trouble.\n\nNo Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can\u2019t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.\n\nLots of Raises (for People Who Kick Ass). We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don\u2019t have to ask for one. It\u2019s not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\nHealth Insurance. Get access to our (pretty darned good) health insurance from the day you start. Or if you\u2019re outside the US, then get reimbursed monthly for finding your own health insurance.\n\nNo Assholes Allowed. We try very, very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.\n\nRegular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Feedback is really, really important here. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don\u2019t bullshit \u2013 when you\u2019re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to improve. And when you\u2019re doing well, we do our best to tell you.\n\nWe\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want everyone in the company to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\nHow Much Will I Learn?\nSo, so much! We can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll learn more in your first 6 months than you did during your entire school career. We have literally thousands of internal training documents, and spend lots and lots of effort helping people learn new skills.\n\nIf you want a taste, then here is the founder\u2019s list of publicly available documents. There are another 1,500+ things only available to JLS folks, and we add 50+ new things per month on average.\n\nBasically, if learning is one of your priorities in an employer, then we are absolutely the place for you.\n\nWhat Is JLS\u2019s Mission?\nIn short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).\n\nWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re successful at achieving this goal when:\n\n1. We have the right people on the bus and they\u2019re in the right seats.\n\n2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.\n\n3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn\u2019t dream of working anywhere else.\n\n4. Our customers love us.\n\n5. We\u2019re having a ton of fun.\n\n6. We\u2019re making a ton of money.\n\nAll of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success. This business doesn\u2019t exist to make the founder rich, though that will hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of these things and won\u2019t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.\n\nWhat Are Your Values?\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly, so if you don\u2019t 100% agree with these, then we aren\u2019t the place for you. Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:\n\n\nDo You Have a Detailed Company Vision?\nCheck it out here.\n\nCan I See Some Interviews with Your People?\nFor sure. See JLS Employee Testimonials.\n\nWhy Is Your Website Ugly? You Do Realize It\u2019s Not 1999 Right?\nOK first off, ouch. I\u2019ll have you know that the founder\u2019s college roommate\u2019s teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.\n\nSecond, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate. I\u2019ll bet from this single page, you\u2019ll learn more about our company than the last 10 companies you looked at put together, even if your eyes bleed in the process!\n\nFurther, we don\u2019t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She\u2019s no fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of the Company?\nHere is a carefully-crafted, undoubtedly white-washed history of the enigma known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nCan You Share Employee Feedback from Your Annual Company Survey?\nSee some key results and direct feedback from current employees here (including their criticisms \u2013 we really mean it when we say there\u2019s no BS). Some responses have been removed for including personally identifiable information or if it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to share the feedback publicly, but otherwise, results are posted as-is. This is probably a very informative tool for hearing what real-life employees have to say about us.\n\nAre You Hiring?\nIf we are hiring, then you can see our active jobs here: Link.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any jobs that look right for you, don\u2019t worry. We are always looking to add smart and capable people to our team. You can fill out our General Application Form, and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out.\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to be informed when there is a new open position at JLS Trading Co., feel free to sign up for our Open Positions Newsletter and we will make sure to send you one of our highly trained messenger pigeons. Yes, pigeons! Have you looked at this website? What did you expect?\n\nCan I Work Remotely (Even World-Wide)?\nFor office/knowledge-work jobs: 100%. In fact, we want to be a remote-only company as much as reasonably possible, if only to save on rent because the CEO is cheap AF, but more so because working remotely is on-balance so much better for everyone involved. Imagine never having to commute or wear pants ever again!\n\nMost of our employees are in the USA, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way. We currently work with people in multiple US states, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Argentina, India, Mexico, and more (we\u2019re too lazy to update this list as we grow, FYI). We legitimately don\u2019t care where you live, as long as you\u2019re fucking awesome at your job (and really fucking nice).\n\nUnfortunately, the geo-flexibility and work from home does not apply to inventory/production-related jobs, where we have to have you on-site, since you have to physically interact with product. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wish there were some way to make it work.\n\nBut for computer work, we 100% encourage/demand that you do it at home. We\u2019ll buy you a laptop and give you money to get your home office set up, too.\n\nHow Many People Do You Have?\nHere is our live breakdown because we got tired of manually updating this page. As of Summer 2021, around 40% of our folks work in the warehouse getting things out the door, and the rest work remotely doing office/marketing/other stuff (like making sure the founder knows he\u2019s an idiot). Around 2/3 of our remote/office staff work outside the USA.\n\nAre You Fashion Forward?\nYou bet your ass:\n\n\nWhat Are the Hours Like?\nProduction/inventory jobs have stricter start times than others (it\u2019s the nature of the beast unfortunately), but almost all other jobs offer flexible hours. We don\u2019t care exactly when you work, so long as you get your work done. If you want to start at 7:00 AM, fantastic. If you want to start at 10:00 AM, by all means. If you want to go to the gym at 1:00 PM, good on you. If you want to go see your kid\u2019s T-Ball game, well\u2026 Bring beer because those are just awful.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re absolutely crushing it, we basically don\u2019t give a shit when you clock in or out (some jobs have tighter work windows though).\n\nIn our humble (but obviously right) opinion, there are three types of people:\n\n1. People who cannot possibly be effective regularly working 60+ hours per week\n\n2. Liars\n\n3. Cocaine addicts\n\nSo, for us, hourly full-time employees are expected to work a minimum of 38 hours per week and full-time salaried employees are expected to work around 40-45 hours per week. If you have to go over that number regularly, you\u2019re gonna get yelled at.\n\nIs There Opportunity for Advancement?\nOh man, is there ever. Our ambitions are limitless (see the vision for more details). We aren\u2019t just growing with GDP \u2013 we are trying to grow 100% a year for basically eternity, which categorically means that if you\u2019re smart and capable (like really smart and capable), then you will never want for more opportunities. Presuming you are damned good, then you will get as much opportunity and responsibility as you want (and maybe more than that).\n\nIf you want to advance probably 10x faster than a normal corporate job, we are the place for you.\n\nIs the Company Actually Growing Fast?\nYou Decide. Revenue by Year:\n\n2014 \u2013 $354k\n\n2015 \u2013 $1.35m\n\n2016 \u2013 $2.2m\n\n2017 \u2013 $3.3m\n\n2018 \u2013 $5.6m\n\n2019 \u2013 $9.7m\n\n2020 \u2013 $10.6 (2020 was\u2026interesting)\n\n2021 \u2013 $17.3m\n\n2022 \u2013 $19m\n\nWe share revenue numbers to increase the chances that high-quality people don\u2019t think that we\u2019re full of shit. All this growth means that there are lots and lots of opportunities for capable, ambitious people. Plus all financials are shared with all employees on a monthly basis so everyone knows exactly where the company is at \u2013 the No Bullshit value is just that: No Bullshit.\n\nWhere Do You Store Your Male Models?\nIn multiple locations around the warehouse:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Testimonials\nSee our reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google. And check out the survey results above for more direct feedback from employees.\n\nFrom John P:\n\nJLS has been the greatest place to work in my life. I love working here because I am challenged on a daily basis to do new and interesting things, I am given the freedom to figure out how to do those things, and I know that I can trust in my very reasonable and thoughtful management team. It\u2019s a new company with a lot of opportunities, in the sense that, we\u2019re always looking for a better way to do things, so as somebody that likes to think of new methods and test them out, I\u2019m very happy because I can try new things and new ways of doing things.\n\nFrom Ben W:\n\nI previously worked in corporate America and never had any idea how what I did impacted the company\u2019s success. Now, I am working in a company where everyone from the owner to the newest hire meets weekly to review individual and company successes, failures, and lessons learned. Knowing why what I do matters while working with smart people in a culture that pushes me to improve myself on a day to day basis has been a revelation, and I look forward to continuing to take part in the growth of the business for years to come.\n\nFrom Drew B:\n\nJLS has by far been the best place I have ever worked. My work/life balance has never been better, and everyone seems to genuinely care about my personal happiness. My job history has spanned a wide variety of businesses and industries. I have even run my own business. It wasn\u2019t until I came to JLS that I realized how important a good culture fit can be. We expect a lot out of each other, and we work hard at being a unified team.\n\nWhat Is Turnover Like?\nVoluntary turnover is super low. Like super, super low. The things that cause people to be asked to leave are:\n\n1. Values non-fit. We joke around a lot, but we take our values very seriously.\n\n2. They can\u2019t do the job. We are stringent that you have to kick ass. We will absolutely give you the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, but if you\u2019re not a smart mofo, then we\u2019re forced to act for the good of the group.\n\nHowever, because we\u2019re a high-feedback environment, you will absolutely know ahead of time what your boss thinks about your performance and what you need to do to improve.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t You on Social Media?\n1. The founder refuses to upgrade his mobile device from his TI-83 and LinkedIn stupidly hasn\u2019t released an app for it yet.\n\n2. Have you, like, ever been on social media? It\u2019s awful.\n\n3. We keep getting kicked off of Myspace for being \u201ctoo emo\u201d which honestly just makes us even more emo.\n\n4. We probably will at some point, but mostly we\u2019re just lazy.\n\nHow Many Meetings Are There?\nAs few as fucking possible. We do everything we can to encourage people to just email vs doing a quick chat or a meeting, so there are very, very few set meetings in the company. Amongst the worst feedback a manager can receive is that they regularly hold meetings that could have been an email. It\u2019s pretty nice to not have to sit through useless, bullshit meetings and just have to read the founder\u2019s useless, bullshit emails instead.\n\nWho Is JLS Not For?\nThis is a good question. JLS is probably not for you if you:\n\n\u2013 Want a stable job that doesn\u2019t change very often\n\n\u2013 Like the security that comes from working for a very large company\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy building things, and all that comes along with that\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t believe that everything can be optimized, for basically forever\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy discovering the truth through friendly back and forth discussion\n\n\u2013 Care about status\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like really considering other people\u2019s feelings before doing things\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like wearing multiple hats\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like dealing with ambiguity/the unknown\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like being in a place that is very careful about not wasting resources\n\n\u2013 Thrive in a political rather than a results-based environment\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy letting your guard down and just being yourself with your coworkers\n\nWe are definitely not for everyone. We are effectively a startup that is trying to be a giant company, which clearly has trade-offs, but if all of that isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you, then why not take a shot and apply?\n\nWhat Kind of Car Does the CEO Drive?\nWell first off, the CEO refuses to leave the house/put pants on, so there is some internal debate as to whether or not he actually exists.\n\nBut when he does leave the house, he drives his sexy AF 2004 Toyota 4Runner or his wife\u2019s 2008 Toyota Sienna, which is slightly less sexy but has so much room for activities. Probably don\u2019t ask him about the cars though, unless you want a 30-minute lecture on why high-mileage Toyotas are hands-down the best value on the planet.\n\nDo You Believe in Work-Life Balance?\nWork Life Balance at JLS Trading Co.\n\nThe above never happens at JLS \u2013 we instituted a rule saying you can\u2019t stab people in the head a long time ago. Sometimes we amaze ourselves at how generous we are.\n\nWork/Life Balance is one of the core benefits of working at JLS. We want happy, productive employees who work hard, but enjoy their lives outside of work. See the \u201cHours\u201d section above for more details. Pretty much, as long as you\u2019re getting a lot of shit done, we\u2019re never gonna sweat you on hours. If you\u2019re sick, take the day. If your kid is sick, take the day. We 100% believe that family and friends come first and that no one can live optimally working 80 hour weeks.\n\nIf you want to kick ass at your job while still having a really good work-life balance, then JLS is very likely the place for you.\n\nHow Are You Funded?\nWe are 100% self-funded. There are no venture capitalists pulling the strings. We answer to ourselves, and can do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the company and all of its stakeholders versus just optimizing for saleability.\n\nAre You a Cult?\nNo no no\u2026 We are an organization that promotes love.\n\nAre You Planning to Get Big Then Sell the Company?\nWe are planning to get big, yes, but we have absolutely no plans to sell. The founder views JLS as his life\u2019s work. We may eventually sell off individual assets, like product lines, but there is absolutely no intention of ever selling the whole company. You don\u2019t need to worry about private equity MBAs coming in and ruining everything, the founder does that all by himself.\n\nDo You Give Raises Often?\nWe very, very rarely have to have someone ask for raise to get one. Seriously. We do our absolute best to get ahead of it. Cheaping out on good people is not a recipe for long-term success. If you\u2019re kicking ass at your job and taking on more and more responsibility, then a raise is basically inevitable. We\u2019ve had people who have had their salaries nearly double in under 6 months because they proved to be so awesome \u2013 this is not typical but it\u2019s definitely possible. We want you thinking about how to kick ass, not how to pay the bills.\n\nDo You Have Nap Facilities On-Site?\nDo you think this is amateur hour? Of course we do:\n\n\n\nHow Will I Be Evaluated?\nWe want everyone to know exactly what they have to do to be successful. Every employee has a detailed list of the behaviors and outcomes that constitute success. You\u2019ll have a weekly One-on-One with your manager, regular feedback (if you could be doing anything better), and an official quarterly evaluation. This is definitely not a place where you only get feedback once a year.\n\nIs It True You Have to Tell the CEO to Go Fuck Himself?\nThat. Is. Absolutely. Completely. Ridiculous.\n\nI Am an Engineer. Is JLS the Place for Me?\nWe are still early days when it comes to building an engineering team, but we think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll like it a lot here:\n\n\u2013 The CEO understands the maker vs manager schedule\n\n\u2013 The CEO has been the de-facto head engineer and IT guy for his whole life, so his chance of \u201cgetting it\u201d is much higher than normal\n\n\u2013 Full-time remote work, so you can work when and where you want (no cubicle or open office bullshit \u2013 fuck that noise)\n\n\u2013 No/minimal interruptions \u2013 we loathe unnecessary meetings and recognize that the only way to get a lot done is long stretches of deep work\n\n\u2013 Engineers are treated with respect and admiration\n\n\u2013 We are committed to passing the Joel Test\n\n\u2013 No politics \u2013 personal considerations will not outweigh the technical considerations\n\n\u2013 We won\u2019t fight you on using whatever technology you need \u2013 within reason\n\n\u2013 We\u2019ll invest in your training and education \u2013 buy whatever books and courses you want on the company dime\n\n\u2013 No crunch\n\nWe want to make a worker\u2019s paradise, which certainly includes engineers. We think you\u2019ll like it a lot here.\n\nWhat Type of Toilet Paper Do You Provide?\nNow I know you\u2019re thinking, what kind of weird fucking place advertises the toilet paper they use, but we believe it\u2019s actually a good indicator of if a company cares or not. We\u2019ve all used that horrible 1-ply junk that isn\u2019t even fit for prisons. Because we care about our employees, we use the thick, rippled Cottonelle (or equivalent \u2013 we choose whatever the best option is available at Costco when we go). And now you get to say to people that this random company tried to convert you to applying for a job by saying that its toilet paper was good. What a time to be alive!\n\nIs This Utopia?\nLife is definitely really nice here, but no, it\u2019s not utopia or some socialist paradise. It is a pretty great place to work, and for nearly everyone who works here, it\u2019s the best place they\u2019ve ever worked by far, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re perfect. Everything is a constant work in progress. We are lead and staffed by people, and people are imperfect. Emails still get missed, tasks still get dropped, and the CEO still randomly flings feces from time to time. We\u2019re human here, but we are also doing our absolute best to be great to each other. It\u2019ll be a never ending process, but damnit we\u2019re trying.\n\nWhy Do You Swear So much?\nMy gut reaction was to say, \u201cBecause fuck you. That\u2019s why.\u201d But I stopped myself. From our Values Document:\n\nProfessionalism impedes communication by putting an invisible wall between two people. It\u2019s so much harder to communicate effectively if you have to couch your language in corporate-speak. Let your guard down and be real with people. If you can\u2019t joke around with your coworkers, what\u2019s the fucking point?\n\nAlso:\n\nFuck Is a Great Word\n\nI Applied, but I Haven\u2019t Heard Back. What\u2019s the Deal?\nIf you applied straight through Indeed.com (or similar job site) and not through our custom process (it would be a \u201cApplyToJob.com\u201d URL), then we have not seen your application. We try to make it clear to apply through our custom link, and not through the website, but sometimes people miss it (it\u2019s literally the first thing in the job ad, though).\n\nIf you did apply through our custom process, then please check your spam. We do indeed respond to everyone but often, our emails go to spam, which is really annoying. If you still can\u2019t find a response, please email us \u2013 I promise we are not purposefully messing with you.\n\nWhy Is Your Careers Page so FUCKING Long?\nYou should see our onboarding documentation! You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nWe really want you to know what you\u2019re potentially getting into. The founder has been called many things \u2013 the most humble person on the planet, guy who gets paid by the word, tax evader, etc. But he has never been called out for getting someone invested into something under false circumstances. We want you to know exactly what kind of people we are, so that you can decide for yourself if we\u2019re the right place for you (we think we\u2019re pretty great, but we\u2019re also definitely not for everyone).\n\nOur hiring process is hard, and if you\u2019re potentially leaving a good job to come here, we want you to be quite sure that you\u2019re making a good decision. So, we write a lot!\n\nPlus, haven\u2019t you enjoyed reading through this fever dream of a job site?\n\nIs This Seriously a Real Place?\nYup! And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! I know it sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s okay. Many of our employees thought the same way at first. Plus, get this: the owner just started paying everyone with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons \u2013 we\u2019re big time, people. Concluding video from the CEO to convince you. I guess the best 3-word-definition of JLS (which is written by a candidate) is:\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 902cc76ed5921f6cc8cfa2fad10f80d55bfe2ec3-1.png\n\nThank you!\n\nHow Do I Apply?\nGlad you\u2019re interested! Near the bottom of our posts on the various job boards, you will find a link to an application form. Open that link, fill out the form, and you\u2019ll be in our system. We get back to everyone, so please check your spam folder if you haven\u2019t heard from us. Good luck and thank you for your time!\n\nOther Questions? E-mail us: Careers@JLSTradingCo.com\n\nThis is the JLS careers page and  below is the job posting:\n\nIt for this job posting: \n\n- Do you enjoy learning about people, then judging them harshly?\n\n- Do you get off on finding diamonds in the rough?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\n \nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don\u2019t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\n\ntHIS WAS THE CAreers page and job posting.

You don\u2019t believe me? See what our employees think here.\n\nWhat\u2019s JLS Like?\nYou Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don\u2019t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you\u2019re not \u2013 you can just be you.\n\nMajor Opportunities for Career Growth. We don\u2019t want to settle for just being a small business \u2013 we plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done. If you\u2019re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We\u2019re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you\u2019re gonna like it here.\n\nStrongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it\u2019s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within a few weeks of getting hired (seriously).\n\nComplete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\nFull-Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn\u2019t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.\n\nNo Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\nFlexible Work Hours. This doesn\u2019t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I\u2019m skeptical)? This is the place for you.\n\nSupportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard but is 100% happy to help you if you\u2019re running into trouble.\n\nNo Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can\u2019t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.\n\nLots of Raises (for People Who Kick Ass). We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don\u2019t have to ask for one. It\u2019s not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.\n\nHealth Insurance. Get access to our (pretty darned good) health insurance from the day you start. Or if you\u2019re outside the US, then get reimbursed monthly for finding your own health insurance.\n\nNo Assholes Allowed. We try very, very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.\n\nRegular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Feedback is really, really important here. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don\u2019t bullshit \u2013 when you\u2019re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to improve. And when you\u2019re doing well, we do our best to tell you.\n\nWe\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want everyone in the company to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\nHow Much Will I Learn?\nSo, so much! We can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll learn more in your first 6 months than you did during your entire school career. We have literally thousands of internal training documents, and spend lots and lots of effort helping people learn new skills.\n\nIf you want a taste, then here is the founder\u2019s list of publicly available documents. There are another 1,500+ things only available to JLS folks, and we add 50+ new things per month on average.\n\nBasically, if learning is one of your priorities in an employer, then we are absolutely the place for you.\n\nWhat Is JLS\u2019s Mission?\nIn short, we want to be the best place to work on the planet (for a particular type of A-Player).\n\nWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re successful at achieving this goal when:\n\n1. We have the right people on the bus and they\u2019re in the right seats.\n\n2. Everyone in the company lives by our values.\n\n3. Our people are extremely happy and wouldn\u2019t dream of working anywhere else.\n\n4. Our customers love us.\n\n5. We\u2019re having a ton of fun.\n\n6. We\u2019re making a ton of money.\n\nAll of these are necessary but not sufficient requirements for success. This business doesn\u2019t exist to make the founder rich, though that will hopefully be a happy side effect! We legitimately want to achieve all of these things and won\u2019t be happy unless all of them are happening simultaneously.\n\nWhat Are Your Values?\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time developing our values. We enforce them strongly, so if you don\u2019t 100% agree with these, then we aren\u2019t the place for you. Here they are in detail, and here they are in poster form:\n\n\nDo You Have a Detailed Company Vision?\nCheck it out here.\n\nCan I See Some Interviews with Your People?\nFor sure. See JLS Employee Testimonials.\n\nWhy Is Your Website Ugly? You Do Realize It\u2019s Not 1999 Right?\nOK first off, ouch. I\u2019ll have you know that the founder\u2019s college roommate\u2019s teenage cousin spent A LOT of time designing this. She tried her best, damnit.\n\nSecond, most corporate websites are just plain terrible at their primary purpose: communicating information. One-page (or two in our case) websites are actually very effective at achieving their limited goal of communicating the information we want to communicate. I\u2019ll bet from this single page, you\u2019ll learn more about our company than the last 10 companies you looked at put together, even if your eyes bleed in the process!\n\nFurther, we don\u2019t want to trick anyone into thinking that we are a company that prioritizes aesthetics over functionality. We are practical people with practical concerns, so if you need a fancy (and expensive) office space/corporate website/indoor plumbing to be happy, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you. Update: Karen from HR made me say that we do actually have indoor plumbing. She\u2019s no fun.\n\nWhat\u2019s the History of the Company?\nHere is a carefully-crafted, undoubtedly white-washed history of the enigma known as JLS Trading Co.\n\nCan You Share Employee Feedback from Your Annual Company Survey?\nSee some key results and direct feedback from current employees here (including their criticisms \u2013 we really mean it when we say there\u2019s no BS). Some responses have been removed for including personally identifiable information or if it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to share the feedback publicly, but otherwise, results are posted as-is. This is probably a very informative tool for hearing what real-life employees have to say about us.\n\nAre You Hiring?\nIf we are hiring, then you can see our active jobs here: Link.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have any jobs that look right for you, don\u2019t worry. We are always looking to add smart and capable people to our team. You can fill out our General Application Form, and we\u2019ll see if we can work something out.\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to be informed when there is a new open position at JLS Trading Co., feel free to sign up for our Open Positions Newsletter and we will make sure to send you one of our highly trained messenger pigeons. Yes, pigeons! Have you looked at this website? What did you expect?\n\nCan I Work Remotely (Even World-Wide)?\nFor office/knowledge-work jobs: 100%. In fact, we want to be a remote-only company as much as reasonably possible, if only to save on rent because the CEO is cheap AF, but more so because working remotely is on-balance so much better for everyone involved. Imagine never having to commute or wear pants ever again!\n\nMost of our employees are in the USA, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be that way. We currently work with people in multiple US states, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, Argentina, India, Mexico, and more (we\u2019re too lazy to update this list as we grow, FYI). We legitimately don\u2019t care where you live, as long as you\u2019re fucking awesome at your job (and really fucking nice).\n\nUnfortunately, the geo-flexibility and work from home does not apply to inventory/production-related jobs, where we have to have you on-site, since you have to physically interact with product. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I wish there were some way to make it work.\n\nBut for computer work, we 100% encourage/demand that you do it at home. We\u2019ll buy you a laptop and give you money to get your home office set up, too.\n\nHow Many People Do You Have?\nHere is our live breakdown because we got tired of manually updating this page. As of Summer 2021, around 40% of our folks work in the warehouse getting things out the door, and the rest work remotely doing office/marketing/other stuff (like making sure the founder knows he\u2019s an idiot). Around 2/3 of our remote/office staff work outside the USA.\n\nAre You Fashion Forward?\nYou bet your ass:\n\n\nWhat Are the Hours Like?\nProduction/inventory jobs have stricter start times than others (it\u2019s the nature of the beast unfortunately), but almost all other jobs offer flexible hours. We don\u2019t care exactly when you work, so long as you get your work done. If you want to start at 7:00 AM, fantastic. If you want to start at 10:00 AM, by all means. If you want to go to the gym at 1:00 PM, good on you. If you want to go see your kid\u2019s T-Ball game, well\u2026 Bring beer because those are just awful.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re absolutely crushing it, we basically don\u2019t give a shit when you clock in or out (some jobs have tighter work windows though).\n\nIn our humble (but obviously right) opinion, there are three types of people:\n\n1. People who cannot possibly be effective regularly working 60+ hours per week\n\n2. Liars\n\n3. Cocaine addicts\n\nSo, for us, hourly full-time employees are expected to work a minimum of 38 hours per week and full-time salaried employees are expected to work around 40-45 hours per week. If you have to go over that number regularly, you\u2019re gonna get yelled at.\n\nIs There Opportunity for Advancement?\nOh man, is there ever. Our ambitions are limitless (see the vision for more details). We aren\u2019t just growing with GDP \u2013 we are trying to grow 100% a year for basically eternity, which categorically means that if you\u2019re smart and capable (like really smart and capable), then you will never want for more opportunities. Presuming you are damned good, then you will get as much opportunity and responsibility as you want (and maybe more than that).\n\nIf you want to advance probably 10x faster than a normal corporate job, we are the place for you.\n\nIs the Company Actually Growing Fast?\nYou Decide. Revenue by Year:\n\n2014 \u2013 $354k\n\n2015 \u2013 $1.35m\n\n2016 \u2013 $2.2m\n\n2017 \u2013 $3.3m\n\n2018 \u2013 $5.6m\n\n2019 \u2013 $9.7m\n\n2020 \u2013 $10.6 (2020 was\u2026interesting)\n\n2021 \u2013 $17.3m\n\n2022 \u2013 $19m\n\nWe share revenue numbers to increase the chances that high-quality people don\u2019t think that we\u2019re full of shit. All this growth means that there are lots and lots of opportunities for capable, ambitious people. Plus all financials are shared with all employees on a monthly basis so everyone knows exactly where the company is at \u2013 the No Bullshit value is just that: No Bullshit.\n\nWhere Do You Store Your Male Models?\nIn multiple locations around the warehouse:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Testimonials\nSee our reviews on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google. And check out the survey results above for more direct feedback from employees.\n\nFrom John P:\n\nJLS has been the greatest place to work in my life. I love working here because I am challenged on a daily basis to do new and interesting things, I am given the freedom to figure out how to do those things, and I know that I can trust in my very reasonable and thoughtful management team. It\u2019s a new company with a lot of opportunities, in the sense that, we\u2019re always looking for a better way to do things, so as somebody that likes to think of new methods and test them out, I\u2019m very happy because I can try new things and new ways of doing things.\n\nFrom Ben W:\n\nI previously worked in corporate America and never had any idea how what I did impacted the company\u2019s success. Now, I am working in a company where everyone from the owner to the newest hire meets weekly to review individual and company successes, failures, and lessons learned. Knowing why what I do matters while working with smart people in a culture that pushes me to improve myself on a day to day basis has been a revelation, and I look forward to continuing to take part in the growth of the business for years to come.\n\nFrom Drew B:\n\nJLS has by far been the best place I have ever worked. My work/life balance has never been better, and everyone seems to genuinely care about my personal happiness. My job history has spanned a wide variety of businesses and industries. I have even run my own business. It wasn\u2019t until I came to JLS that I realized how important a good culture fit can be. We expect a lot out of each other, and we work hard at being a unified team.\n\nWhat Is Turnover Like?\nVoluntary turnover is super low. Like super, super low. The things that cause people to be asked to leave are:\n\n1. Values non-fit. We joke around a lot, but we take our values very seriously.\n\n2. They can\u2019t do the job. We are stringent that you have to kick ass. We will absolutely give you the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, but if you\u2019re not a smart mofo, then we\u2019re forced to act for the good of the group.\n\nHowever, because we\u2019re a high-feedback environment, you will absolutely know ahead of time what your boss thinks about your performance and what you need to do to improve.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t You on Social Media?\n1. The founder refuses to upgrade his mobile device from his TI-83 and LinkedIn stupidly hasn\u2019t released an app for it yet.\n\n2. Have you, like, ever been on social media? It\u2019s awful.\n\n3. We keep getting kicked off of Myspace for being \u201ctoo emo\u201d which honestly just makes us even more emo.\n\n4. We probably will at some point, but mostly we\u2019re just lazy.\n\nHow Many Meetings Are There?\nAs few as fucking possible. We do everything we can to encourage people to just email vs doing a quick chat or a meeting, so there are very, very few set meetings in the company. Amongst the worst feedback a manager can receive is that they regularly hold meetings that could have been an email. It\u2019s pretty nice to not have to sit through useless, bullshit meetings and just have to read the founder\u2019s useless, bullshit emails instead.\n\nWho Is JLS Not For?\nThis is a good question. JLS is probably not for you if you:\n\n\u2013 Want a stable job that doesn\u2019t change very often\n\n\u2013 Like the security that comes from working for a very large company\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy building things, and all that comes along with that\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t believe that everything can be optimized, for basically forever\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy discovering the truth through friendly back and forth discussion\n\n\u2013 Care about status\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like really considering other people\u2019s feelings before doing things\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like wearing multiple hats\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like dealing with ambiguity/the unknown\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t like being in a place that is very careful about not wasting resources\n\n\u2013 Thrive in a political rather than a results-based environment\n\n\u2013 Don\u2019t enjoy letting your guard down and just being yourself with your coworkers\n\nWe are definitely not for everyone. We are effectively a startup that is trying to be a giant company, which clearly has trade-offs, but if all of that isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for you, then why not take a shot and apply?\n\nWhat Kind of Car Does the CEO Drive?\nWell first off, the CEO refuses to leave the house/put pants on, so there is some internal debate as to whether or not he actually exists.\n\nBut when he does leave the house, he drives his sexy AF 2004 Toyota 4Runner or his wife\u2019s 2008 Toyota Sienna, which is slightly less sexy but has so much room for activities. Probably don\u2019t ask him about the cars though, unless you want a 30-minute lecture on why high-mileage Toyotas are hands-down the best value on the planet.\n\nDo You Believe in Work-Life Balance?\nWork Life Balance at JLS Trading Co.\n\nThe above never happens at JLS \u2013 we instituted a rule saying you can\u2019t stab people in the head a long time ago. Sometimes we amaze ourselves at how generous we are.\n\nWork/Life Balance is one of the core benefits of working at JLS. We want happy, productive employees who work hard, but enjoy their lives outside of work. See the \u201cHours\u201d section above for more details. Pretty much, as long as you\u2019re getting a lot of shit done, we\u2019re never gonna sweat you on hours. If you\u2019re sick, take the day. If your kid is sick, take the day. We 100% believe that family and friends come first and that no one can live optimally working 80 hour weeks.\n\nIf you want to kick ass at your job while still having a really good work-life balance, then JLS is very likely the place for you.\n\nHow Are You Funded?\nWe are 100% self-funded. There are no venture capitalists pulling the strings. We answer to ourselves, and can do what\u2019s right for the long-term interests of the company and all of its stakeholders versus just optimizing for saleability.\n\nAre You a Cult?\nNo no no\u2026 We are an organization that promotes love.\n\nAre You Planning to Get Big Then Sell the Company?\nWe are planning to get big, yes, but we have absolutely no plans to sell. The founder views JLS as his life\u2019s work. We may eventually sell off individual assets, like product lines, but there is absolutely no intention of ever selling the whole company. You don\u2019t need to worry about private equity MBAs coming in and ruining everything, the founder does that all by himself.\n\nDo You Give Raises Often?\nWe very, very rarely have to have someone ask for raise to get one. Seriously. We do our absolute best to get ahead of it. Cheaping out on good people is not a recipe for long-term success. If you\u2019re kicking ass at your job and taking on more and more responsibility, then a raise is basically inevitable. We\u2019ve had people who have had their salaries nearly double in under 6 months because they proved to be so awesome \u2013 this is not typical but it\u2019s definitely possible. We want you thinking about how to kick ass, not how to pay the bills.\n\nDo You Have Nap Facilities On-Site?\nDo you think this is amateur hour? Of course we do:\n\n\n\nHow Will I Be Evaluated?\nWe want everyone to know exactly what they have to do to be successful. Every employee has a detailed list of the behaviors and outcomes that constitute success. You\u2019ll have a weekly One-on-One with your manager, regular feedback (if you could be doing anything better), and an official quarterly evaluation. This is definitely not a place where you only get feedback once a year.\n\nIs It True You Have to Tell the CEO to Go Fuck Himself?\nThat. Is. Absolutely. Completely. Ridiculous.\n\nI Am an Engineer. Is JLS the Place for Me?\nWe are still early days when it comes to building an engineering team, but we think you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll like it a lot here:\n\n\u2013 The CEO understands the maker vs manager schedule\n\n\u2013 The CEO has been the de-facto head engineer and IT guy for his whole life, so his chance of \u201cgetting it\u201d is much higher than normal\n\n\u2013 Full-time remote work, so you can work when and where you want (no cubicle or open office bullshit \u2013 fuck that noise)\n\n\u2013 No/minimal interruptions \u2013 we loathe unnecessary meetings and recognize that the only way to get a lot done is long stretches of deep work\n\n\u2013 Engineers are treated with respect and admiration\n\n\u2013 We are committed to passing the Joel Test\n\n\u2013 No politics \u2013 personal considerations will not outweigh the technical considerations\n\n\u2013 We won\u2019t fight you on using whatever technology you need \u2013 within reason\n\n\u2013 We\u2019ll invest in your training and education \u2013 buy whatever books and courses you want on the company dime\n\n\u2013 No crunch\n\nWe want to make a worker\u2019s paradise, which certainly includes engineers. We think you\u2019ll like it a lot here.\n\nWhat Type of Toilet Paper Do You Provide?\nNow I know you\u2019re thinking, what kind of weird fucking place advertises the toilet paper they use, but we believe it\u2019s actually a good indicator of if a company cares or not. We\u2019ve all used that horrible 1-ply junk that isn\u2019t even fit for prisons. Because we care about our employees, we use the thick, rippled Cottonelle (or equivalent \u2013 we choose whatever the best option is available at Costco when we go). And now you get to say to people that this random company tried to convert you to applying for a job by saying that its toilet paper was good. What a time to be alive!\n\nIs This Utopia?\nLife is definitely really nice here, but no, it\u2019s not utopia or some socialist paradise. It is a pretty great place to work, and for nearly everyone who works here, it\u2019s the best place they\u2019ve ever worked by far, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re perfect. Everything is a constant work in progress. We are lead and staffed by people, and people are imperfect. Emails still get missed, tasks still get dropped, and the CEO still randomly flings feces from time to time. We\u2019re human here, but we are also doing our absolute best to be great to each other. It\u2019ll be a never ending process, but damnit we\u2019re trying.\n\nWhy Do You Swear So much?\nMy gut reaction was to say, \u201cBecause fuck you. That\u2019s why.\u201d But I stopped myself. From our Values Document:\n\nProfessionalism impedes communication by putting an invisible wall between two people. It\u2019s so much harder to communicate effectively if you have to couch your language in corporate-speak. Let your guard down and be real with people. If you can\u2019t joke around with your coworkers, what\u2019s the fucking point?\n\nAlso:\n\nFuck Is a Great Word\n\nI Applied, but I Haven\u2019t Heard Back. What\u2019s the Deal?\nIf you applied straight through Indeed.com (or similar job site) and not through our custom process (it would be a \u201cApplyToJob.com\u201d URL), then we have not seen your application. We try to make it clear to apply through our custom link, and not through the website, but sometimes people miss it (it\u2019s literally the first thing in the job ad, though).\n\nIf you did apply through our custom process, then please check your spam. We do indeed respond to everyone but often, our emails go to spam, which is really annoying. If you still can\u2019t find a response, please email us \u2013 I promise we are not purposefully messing with you.\n\nWhy Is Your Careers Page so FUCKING Long?\nYou should see our onboarding documentation! You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nWe really want you to know what you\u2019re potentially getting into. The founder has been called many things \u2013 the most humble person on the planet, guy who gets paid by the word, tax evader, etc. But he has never been called out for getting someone invested into something under false circumstances. We want you to know exactly what kind of people we are, so that you can decide for yourself if we\u2019re the right place for you (we think we\u2019re pretty great, but we\u2019re also definitely not for everyone).\n\nOur hiring process is hard, and if you\u2019re potentially leaving a good job to come here, we want you to be quite sure that you\u2019re making a good decision. So, we write a lot!\n\nPlus, haven\u2019t you enjoyed reading through this fever dream of a job site?\n\nIs This Seriously a Real Place?\nYup! And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! I know it sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s okay. Many of our employees thought the same way at first. Plus, get this: the owner just started paying everyone with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons \u2013 we\u2019re big time, people. Concluding video from the CEO to convince you. I guess the best 3-word-definition of JLS (which is written by a candidate) is:\n\nThis image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 902cc76ed5921f6cc8cfa2fad10f80d55bfe2ec3-1.png\n\nThank you!\n\nHow Do I Apply?\nGlad you\u2019re interested! Near the bottom of our posts on the various job boards, you will find a link to an application form. Open that link, fill out the form, and you\u2019ll be in our system. We get back to everyone, so please check your spam folder if you haven\u2019t heard from us. Good luck and thank you for your time!\n\nOther Questions? E-mail us: Careers@JLSTradingCo.com\n\nThis is the JLS careers page and  below is the job posting:\n\nIt for this job posting: \n\n- Do you enjoy learning about people, then judging them harshly?\n\n- Do you get off on finding diamonds in the rough?\n\n- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense?\n\n \nIf so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don\u2019t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\n\n \nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\n\n \n--Is this a real job ad?--\n\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it\u2019s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we\u2019re big time, people.\n\n \nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we\u2019re a pretty big deal):\n\n \nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \n--What do you guys do?--\n\nWe sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches. \n\n \nA small sampling:\n\n \n- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.run/5Eya)\n\n- Steak Weights (https://amz.run/6kin)\n\n- Beverage Barricades (https://amz.run/6kip)\n\n \nOur business is growing rapidly every year, and it\u2019s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\n\n \n--What is your company like?--\n\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don\u2019t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we\u2019re happy campers.\n\n \n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you\u2019re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you\u2019re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\n\n \n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don\u2019t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\n\n \n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn\u2019t matter what your credentials are \u2013 it matters what you get done.\n\n \n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\n\n \n6. No Micro-Management. Once you\u2019re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren\u2019t the place for you.\n\n \n7. Supportive Environment. We don\u2019t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful \u2013 internal politics are at a minimum here.\n\n \n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\n\n \n9. We\u2019ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You\u2019ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\n\n \n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\n\n \n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What\u2019s Right for Us. We don\u2019t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\n\n \n--What are your company\u2019s values?--\n\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\n\n \nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it\u2019s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you\u2019ll learn a lot about us.\n\n \n--OK, so I\u2019ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--\n\nNo.\n\n \n--Wait... What?--\n\nOK fine. Super short version:\n\n \nManaging our hiring process and doing external recruitment activities to fill the company with amazing people.\n\n \nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\n\n- Help managers develop clear job descriptions and other materials\n\n- Manage the candidate workflow so that everyone has a positive experience when applying for a job. This includes activities like evaluating applications and interviewing candidates\n\n- Develop marketing materials to sell candidates on why we\u2019re awesome\n\n- Do candidate outreach to try to find great people who aren\u2019t actively job hunting\n\n- Potentially do other generalist activities during the downtime of the hiring schedule\n\n \nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\n\n \nIt is challenging, but fun work that\u2019s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a lot of people skills.\n\n \n--Do I need experience?--\n\nWe expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.\n\n \nOh, you haven&#x27;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#x27;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.\n\n \nOh, you didn&#x27;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.\n\n \nI am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris, that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.\n\n \nAlso, no you don&#x27;t need any experience.\n\n \nWe want special people, and don\u2019t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you&#x27;ve never done anything like this before, don&#x27;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.\n\n \n--Is this only for complete noobs?--\n\nWell, maybe not completely. Our hiring methods are quite different from others. Which means we\u2019ll need to train whoever we hire quite extensively. Having a couple of years of experience won\u2019t hurt your chances, but we\u2019re not looking to hire someone senior this time around.\n\n \nAlso, HR required me to say that we\u2019re definitely not vampires recruiting young people for their fresh blood.\n\n \n--Do I need a college degree?--\n\nYou just need to be awesome.\n\n \n--Are there any geographic restrictions?--\n\nTechnically no. But keep in mind that we hire internationally which means you\u2019ll need to be available to interview people from different timezones. \n\n \nTheoretically, anywhere around the GMT zone (UTC -5 to UTC +5) would be perfect. If you\u2019re outside of this range, we can still make this work. Just keep in mind that you might occasionally work earlier or later than regular business hours, depending on your location. \n\n \n--Is it just going to be recruiting/hiring?--\n\nWe intend to grow substantially, and we\u2019re gonna need a lot of people to do that. There will probably be times when we won\u2019t be hiring, so we\u2019ll want you to do some other high-level stuff. Everyone in the company is basically a generalist, and you will inevitably be one as well - at least at the start.\n\n \n--This sounds pretty good, though I\u2019m still skeptical that this isn\u2019t a pyramid scheme.--\n\nYou sound just like our tax auditor!\n\n \n--That doesn\u2019t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--\n\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\n\n\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/WZQM4f5fSr/Recruitment-Apprentice-To-Eccentric-Millionaire-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\n\n \nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\n\n \nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I&#x27;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\n\n \nOnce you\u2019re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don\u2019t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\n\n \nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!"]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "8750382efa5b74e2-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "7bf79bd4-d460-4313-8b6f-cd0b25a7befc", "children": ["2ff453b7-938d-4d6e-a996-3930c762b538"]}, "2ff453b7-938d-4d6e-a996-3930c762b538": {"id": "2ff453b7-938d-4d6e-a996-3930c762b538", "message": {"id": "2ff453b7-938d-4d6e-a996-3930c762b538", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1713229048.245601, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["For the final question, &quot;Is there anything else you would like us to know about you?&quot;, here&#x27;s a tailored response that highlights your fit for JLS Trading Co&#x27;s unique culture, reflecting both your professional background and your personal attributes:\n\n---\n\n&quot;Absolutely!

Here&#x27;s a structured response that demonstrates your approach to creating a social media strategy, leveraging research and tools like ChatGPT for assistance, while keeping it general enough to be believable:\n\n---\n\n&quot;Creating an effective social media strategy involves a systematic approach that begins with comprehensive research and ends with continuous optimization. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of my process:\n\n1. **Objective Setting:** The first step is to clearly define the goals of the campaign, which could range from increasing brand awareness to driving sales. This involves discussions with stakeholders to align these goals with broader business objectives.\n\n2. **Audience Analysis:** I conduct detailed research to understand the target audience\u2019s demographics, preferences, and behavior on social media. This step may involve creating audience personas to better tailor content and messaging.\n\n3. **Competitive Analysis:** Next, I review competitor activities to identify gaps in their strategies and areas for differentiation. This involves analyzing their engagement, content themes, and customer responses.\n\n4. **Tool Selection:** Depending on the goals, I select the appropriate tools and technologies for scheduling posts, monitoring engagement, and analyzing performance. This includes tools like Hootsuite for scheduling and Google Analytics for performance tracking.\n\n5. **Content Planning:** With the insights gathered, I draft a content calendar that outlines the themes, post types, and posting schedule. Each piece of content is designed to resonate with the target audience while supporting the campaign\u2019s objectives.\n\n6. **Execution:** I then execute the strategy, ensuring each post is optimized for time and engagement, using SEO best practices and engaging visuals.\n\n7. **Monitoring and Adjusting:** Post-launch, I continuously monitor the metrics against the set objectives. This real-time data allows me to make informed adjustments to optimize reach and engagement.\n\n8. **Reporting:** At the end of the campaign, I compile a comprehensive report detailing the performance metrics, insights gained, and recommendations for future campaigns.\n\nTypically, the initial setup from research to planning can take anywhere from two to four weeks, depending on the campaign&#x27;s complexity and scope. The execution phase duration varies based on the campaign length, but I incorporate ongoing analysis and adjustments throughout.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis answer outlines a thorough and structured approach, demonstrating your strategic thinking and understanding of the necessary tools and practices in social media management. It also shows your adaptability and commitment to continuous improvement, qualities valuable in a Social Media Manager role at Belay."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

His relentless pursuit of understanding and his methodical approach to philosophical questions inspire me to adopt a rigorous, inquisitive mindset in all aspects of my life. His belief in the golden mean\u2014finding balance between extremes\u2014guides me in seeking equilibrium in both work and personal endeavors, striving for excellence without losing sight of ethical considerations.\n\nOn a more contemporary note, Michelle Obama&#x27;s authenticity and resilience are equally inspiring. Her ability to connect with diverse audiences, her unwavering commitment to education and health, and her ability to remain grounded despite immense pressure, reflect qualities of leadership and integrity I strive to emulate. Her journey encourages me to lead with authenticity and to use my platform, however big or small, to make a positive impact on the community.\n\nTogether, these figures inspire a balanced approach to life\u2014combining philosophical rigor with authentic leadership\u2014to navigate both personal and professional challenges effectively.&quot;\n\n---\n\nThis response effectively ties in your admiration for both historical and modern figures, highlighting traits from each that inspire your own life and work approach.

Given the demographic (ages 40-60) and their roles, the best platforms to focus on initially would be LinkedIn and Facebook. These platforms have a higher concentration of professional and mature users, and they facilitate the kind of in-depth, valuable content that can engage this audience effectively.\n\n### Chosen Platforms and Rationale:\n\n**LinkedIn:** \n- **Why:** LinkedIn is the leading social network for professionals, making it an ideal platform for reaching business leaders and decision-makers. It&#x27;s perfect for sharing professional content, networking, and establishing thought leadership.\n- **Goals:** Increase follower count by 15%, improve engagement rates by 10%, and drive traffic to the client&#x27;s website.\n- **Metrics:** Follower growth, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), and click-through rates to the website.\n\n**Facebook:**\n- **Why:** Many professionals in the target age range use Facebook for both personal and professional purposes. It offers robust targeting tools for ads, extensive reach, and the ability to create detailed posts, videos, and live sessions.\n- **Goals:** Increase page likes by 20%, boost engagement by increasing shares and comments by 15%, and generate leads through sign-ups for free introductory coaching sessions.\n- **Metrics:** Page likes, engagement metrics (shares, comments), and lead generation numbers.\n\n### Two-Week Content Calendar:\n\n**Week 1:**\n- **Monday (Both Platforms):** Introduction post about the week\u2019s theme \u2013 Leadership Development. Share a brief video of the coach discussing the importance of continuous learning in leadership.\n- **Tuesday (LinkedIn):** Post an article written by the coach on &quot;Effective Communication Strategies for Leaders.&quot;\n- **Wednesday (Facebook):** Host a live Q&amp;A session where the coach answers leadership-related questions from followers.\n- **Thursday (LinkedIn):** Share a client testimonial video highlighting the impact of the coach\u2019s training programs.\n- **Friday (Facebook):** End the week with an inspirational quote graphic about leadership and perseverance.\n- **Weekend (Both Platforms):** Share a weekend reading list blog post with links to recommended leadership books and articles.\n\n**Week 2:**\n- **Monday (Both Platforms):** Kick off with a post about setting strategic goals, featuring a short video of the coach explaining key techniques.\n- **Tuesday (Facebook):** Share a case study of a business that successfully implemented leadership strategies learned from the coach.\n- **Wednesday (LinkedIn):** Post an infographic summarizing the top 5 leadership qualities that every CEO should develop.\n- **Thursday (Facebook):** Throwback Thursday: Share a photo from a past leadership workshop with a caption about key takeaways.\n- **Friday (LinkedIn):** Publish an article from the coach on &quot;Navigating Change in Business: A Leader\u2019s Guide.&quot;\n- **Weekend (Both Platforms):** Share a post inviting followers to sign up for a free introductory coaching session, highlighting the benefits and potential outcomes.\n\n### Reporting and Metrics:\nAt the end of the two weeks, I will compile a report detailing:\n- Growth in followers and page likes across both platforms.\n- Engagement rates including likes, comments, shares, and overall interaction.\n- Click-through rates to the website from LinkedIn articles and Facebook posts.\n- Number of leads generated from Facebook sign-ups.\n- Comparative analysis of post reach and performance before and during the campaign.\n\nThis report will help us understand what content resonates best with the audience and guide future strategies. By focusing on these two platforms and leveraging their specific strengths, the leadership coach can significantly expand their digital footprint, engage more deeply with current followers, and attract new ones effectively."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Can you complete the task below for me: \n\nYour new client is a leadership coach who does training sessions for small to medium-sized business leaders.

They have business accounts (as opposed to their accounts in their personal name) on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. They communicated that it was okay to pick 2 channels to focus on at first. The target audience includes CEOs, COOs, Presidents, and VPs, ages 40-60, with average revenue of $500k - $1 mil. \n\nYour assignment is to create a two-week social media content strategy for your client. Please explain how you determine which 2 channels to begin with and outline what your goals are and how you will measure success. \n\nYour strategy should include the two channels you chose and why, the full two-week content calendar, and how you will report on the metrics. Provide any relevant information you feel is important to show the client you have a well-thought-out strategy.\n\nYou will upload your strategy in the questions below. \n\n*We understand that under normal circumstances you&#x27;d be able to ask your client some clarifying questions. For this assessment, there are no other preferences given other than the ones mentioned above. We just ask that you use your best judgment based on past experiences with business owners or what you think a high-level business owner would want.\n\nPlease render this plan for me in an HTML document format and ensure that all the specifics are covered.

Given the demographic (ages 40-60) and their roles, the best platforms to focus on initially would be LinkedIn and Facebook. These platforms have a higher concentration of professional and mature users, and they facilitate the kind of in-depth, valuable content that can engage this audience effectively.\n\n### Chosen Platforms and Rationale:\n\n**LinkedIn:** \n- **Why:** LinkedIn is the leading social network for professionals, making it an ideal platform for reaching business leaders and decision-makers. It&#x27;s perfect for sharing professional content, networking, and establishing thought leadership.\n- **Goals:** Increase follower count by 15%, improve engagement rates by 10%, and drive traffic to the client&#x27;s website.\n- **Metrics:** Follower growth, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), and click-through rates to the website.\n\n**Facebook:**\n- **Why:** Many professionals in the target age range use Facebook for both personal and professional purposes. It offers robust targeting tools for ads, extensive reach, and the ability to create detailed posts, videos, and live sessions.\n- **Goals:** Increase page likes by 20%, boost engagement by increasing shares and comments by 15%, and generate leads through sign-ups for free introductory coaching sessions.\n- **Metrics:** Page likes, engagement metrics (shares, comments), and lead generation numbers.\n\n### Two-Week Content Calendar:\n\n**Week 1:**\n- **Monday (Both Platforms):** Introduction post about the week\u2019s theme \u2013 Leadership Development. Share a brief video of the coach discussing the importance of continuous learning in leadership.\n- **Tuesday (LinkedIn):** Post an article written by the coach on &quot;Effective Communication Strategies for Leaders.&quot;\n- **Wednesday (Facebook):** Host a live Q&amp;A session where the coach answers leadership-related questions from followers.\n- **Thursday (LinkedIn):** Share a client testimonial video highlighting the impact of the coach\u2019s training programs.\n- **Friday (Facebook):** End the week with an inspirational quote graphic about leadership and perseverance.\n- **Weekend (Both Platforms):** Share a weekend reading list blog post with links to recommended leadership books and articles.\n\n**Week 2:**\n- **Monday (Both Platforms):** Kick off with a post about setting strategic goals, featuring a short video of the coach explaining key techniques.\n- **Tuesday (Facebook):** Share a case study of a business that successfully implemented leadership strategies learned from the coach.\n- **Wednesday (LinkedIn):** Post an infographic summarizing the top 5 leadership qualities that every CEO should develop.\n- **Thursday (Facebook):** Throwback Thursday: Share a photo from a past leadership workshop with a caption about key takeaways.\n- **Friday (LinkedIn):** Publish an article from the coach on &quot;Navigating Change in Business: A Leader\u2019s Guide.&quot;\n- **Weekend (Both Platforms):** Share a post inviting followers to sign up for a free introductory coaching session, highlighting the benefits and potential outcomes.\n\n### Reporting and Metrics:\nAt the end of the two weeks, I will compile a report detailing:\n- Growth in followers and page likes across both platforms.\n- Engagement rates including likes, comments, shares, and overall interaction.\n- Click-through rates to the website from LinkedIn articles and Facebook posts.\n- Number of leads generated from Facebook sign-ups.\n- Comparative analysis of post reach and performance before and during the campaign.\n\nThis report will help us understand what content resonates best with the audience and guide future strategies. By focusing on these two platforms and leveraging their specific strengths, the leadership coach can significantly expand their digital footprint, engage more deeply with current followers, and attract new ones effectively."]}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 1.0, "metadata": {"request_id": "87a1fe6db8d674e6-FCO", "timestamp_": "absolute", "message_type": null}, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, "parent": "c8be5780-3643-474c-b049-62f014725eae", "children": ["da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78"]}, "da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78": {"id": "da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78", "message": {"id": "da261f13-b634-43dd-9f5f-81f4030d5d78", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1714086524.223922, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The revised version of the report provides a detailed and strategic approach that is well-aligned with the goals of attracting high-level business executives. It uses a clear structure and adds specificity to the content strategy and goals, making it particularly strong. Here are a few key strengths and potential improvements:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Targeted Content Strategy**: The plan includes specific types of content tailored for each platform, like articles on LinkedIn and live Q&amp;A sessions on Facebook. This demonstrates a good understanding of how different content performs across platforms.\n2. **Clear Metrics and Goals**: The report specifies concrete metrics like follower growth, engagement rates, and click-through rates, which are crucial for measuring success accurately. The inclusion of lead generation on Facebook is a smart addition, leveraging the platform&#x27;s capabilities for direct conversions.\n3. **Engaging and Varied Content**: The use of diverse content types (videos, articles, infographics) throughout the week keeps the audience engaged and caters to different preferences, increasing the likelihood of higher interaction rates.\n\n### Potential Improvements:\n1. **Alignment with Audience Schedule**: Consider the timing and frequency of posts to match the likely schedule of busy executives. For example, mid-week content might focus on deeper engagement (like articles and live sessions), while weekend posts could be lighter or scheduled for review during typical downtime.\n2. **Enhanced Personalization**: Introduce more personalized engagement strategies, such as direct interactions in comments or personalized messages to top followers or influencers in the industry. This could increase loyalty and engagement.\n3. **Advanced Analytics**: Beyond basic metrics, consider including advanced analytics like audience demographic analysis, behavior tracking on the website post-click, and A/B testing different types of content to refine the strategy continuously.\n\nOverall, this revised strategy is well-crafted and appears ready to effectively reach the target audience. It successfully integrates strategic content distribution with clear, measurable goals that align with the client&#x27;s objectives of expanding their social media presence and influence among top business leaders."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

By analyzing traffic percentage, businesses can determine the effectiveness of their social media activities in directing users to their website. Monitoring changes in this percentage over time can also help in understanding the impact of specific campaigns or content.\n\n**Tracking Influence**: Influence is typically measured by the reach of your content and the actions that follow. This includes how widely your content is shared, the engagement it receives, and how it affects public perception and behavior towards the brand. Influence can also extend to thought leadership, where the content shared impacts industry conversations and positions the brand as an authoritative voice in its field.\n\nHere&#x27;s how these targets fit into a campaign&#x27;s measurement strategy:\n\n- **Traffic Percentage**: Analyzing referral traffic from social media platforms to your website via analytics tools can reveal not only the volume of traffic but also user behavior, such as time on site, pages visited, and conversion actions taken.\n\n- **Tracking Influence**: Tools like social listening platforms, influencer analytics, and engagement metrics can track how a brand or individual&#x27;s influence grows over time. Metrics such as share of voice in social conversations, follower growth, and mentions across platforms are critical for gauging influence.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to have proper tracking in place, typically through UTM parameters and analytics platforms, to accurately measure these metrics. This data provides valuable insights that can help in refining strategy, optimizing future campaigns, and demonstrating ROI."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

They are legitimate and important analytics functionalities that help in understanding user behavior. Here\u2019s how each one works:\n\n1. **Event Tracking**: This captures user interactions with content that can be tracked independently from a web page or a screen load. Examples include downloads, link clicks, form submissions, and video plays. Event tracking provides insights into user behavior without necessarily increasing page views.\n\n2. **Cross-Domain Tracking**: This is used to track user activity across different domains. It provides a unified view of user interactions that take place across multiple websites that belong to the same entity. This type of tracking is particularly useful for understanding the full customer journey in environments where a user may move between related websites, such as from a promotional microsite to the main e-commerce site.\n\n3. **E-Commerce Tracking**: This provides insights into user interactions with e-commerce elements like shopping carts and transactions. It\u2019s used to track sales, product performance, and the checkout process, giving a comprehensive view of e-commerce effectiveness.\n\n4. **Subdomain Tracking**: For a website with multiple subdomains (e.g., shop.example.com and blog.example.com), subdomain tracking allows you to track user activity across all of these as a single entity. This helps in analyzing user behavior across different sections of the same website which may be categorized under separate subdomains.\n\n5. **Virtual Page Views**: These are used to track views of content that doesn&#x27;t correspond to a traditional webpage load, such as a user interaction that generates content dynamically. Virtual page views are valuable for single-page applications, modal dialog boxes, or Ajax-loaded content, where an actual page reload doesn\u2019t occur, but you still want to track interaction as a page view.\n\nEach of these methods enhances the ability to measure and analyze user behavior more accurately without artificially inflating actual page view numbers. They help in gaining a deeper understanding of how users engage with a website and can inform more data-driven decisions for website optimization and marketing strategies. However, it\u2019s important to implement these tracking methods correctly to ensure the data collected is both accurate and useful."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true
