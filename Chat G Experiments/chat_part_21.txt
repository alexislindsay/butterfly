Johnson&#x27;s brother, John Rosamond Johnson, composed the music for the poem, turning it into a song.\n\n&quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; was originally performed in 1900 by a group of 500 schoolchildren in Jacksonville, Florida, to commemorate Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s birthday. Over time, it gained popularity as a powerful expression of resilience, hope, and perseverance within the African American community.\n\nThe song became an integral part of the civil rights movement during the 20th century. It was often sung during rallies, protests, and events that advocated for racial equality and justice. The lyrics of the song reflect the struggles faced by African Americans throughout history and emphasize the strength, unity, and determination of the community.\n\nIn 1919, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) adopted &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; as its official song. Since then, it has been widely recognized as a symbol of African American pride and resilience.\n\nIn recent years, &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; has gained increased recognition and exposure, including performances at significant events such as the inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2009. Many consider it a powerful anthem that celebrates the rich cultural heritage and enduring spirit of the African American community.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to note that while &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; is often referred to as the &quot;Black National Anthem,&quot; it does not hold official national recognition or status in the same way as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; does for the United States."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

The impacts of global warming are already being felt around the world, including rising temperatures, melting ice caps, more frequent extreme weather events, and ecosystem disruptions. However, the exact point at which these effects become catastrophic is difficult to determine precisely.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a leading international body of climate scientists, has provided assessments on the potential consequences of global warming. In its reports, the IPCC has highlighted the need to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid severe and irreversible impacts.\n\nThe Paris Agreement, a global effort to combat climate change, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, achieving these targets requires significant and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe timeframe for catastrophic impacts depends on various factors, including the rate of emissions, the effectiveness of mitigation measures, and the Earth&#x27;s climate system&#x27;s response. The severity of the consequences also varies across regions and ecosystems.\n\nIt&#x27;s worth noting that the impacts of global warming are already being felt, and many scientists stress the urgency of taking immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and implement adaptation measures to mitigate the potential catastrophic outcomes. The sooner substantial actions are taken, the better the chances of avoiding or minimizing the worst-case scenarios associated with global warming."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true

Generally, the range of temperatures used for infusing milk with cannabis is between 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) and 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C).\n\nAt temperatures below 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C), the infusion process may take longer, but it can help preserve the terpenes and volatile compounds in the cannabis, which can contribute to the flavor and aroma. However, lower temperatures may result in a less potent infusion.\n\nOn the other hand, temperatures above 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C) can expedite the infusion process but may also risk degrading some of the cannabinoids and potentially affecting the flavor.\n\nOne common approach is to heat the milk to around 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) and maintain that temperature for an extended period, such as 1 to 2 hours, to allow for effective infusion. This method balances both efficiency and the preservation of desirable compounds.\n\nIt&#x27;s important to note that when infusing milk with cannabis, you should be cautious not to overheat it, as excessive heat can cause the milk to scorch or curdle, affecting both taste and texture."]}, "status": "finished_successfully","end_turn": true
